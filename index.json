What powers your average e-bike are Lithium-Ion cells, usually of the 18650 variety, capacities vary but the very best cells you can get at the moment that are still affordable top out at about 3400 mAh per cell.

    "Description": "This tutorial will show you how to build a basic project and upload it to your Thumby using our online IDE!\n\nMaterials \nHardware: \n\nMicro USB Cable\nThumby\n\n\nSoftware: \n\n\nGoogle Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browsers (other browsers not supported)\nTinyCircuits Thumby Editor IDE website\n\n\n\nBackground:\n\nOnly Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge support running the TinyCircuits Thumby Editor IDE webpage\n\n\nStep 1: Assembly (Hardware)\nSimply plug in the Thumby to your computer using a Micro USB cable and flip the power switch ON to the right (when looking at the screen).\n\nStep 2: Software (Setup)\nOpen Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and open the online Thumby IDE, the below screen will appear:\n\nFigure 1: Screen on opening IDE for the first time\nIf you prefer a light theme, hover over the 'Utilities' dropdown in the top bar and left-click 'Invert Theme'.\n\nFigure 2: Light theme\nTo connect the Thumby,\n\nClick 'Connect Thumby' in the top bar\nSelect the device through the pop-up menu\nClick 'Connect'\n\nThe below screenshot shows the button locations and order to click them in.\n \nFigure 3: Steps to connect Thumby\nIf connection is successful, a green 'Connected' message will be printed to the terminal.\nAfter doing the above steps the Thumby will be paired to the webpage and will auto-connect when 'Connect Thumby' is clicked.\n\nWith the Thumby connected it is time to upload some code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: The Code!\n\n\nFollow the below steps to start a project and then upload it to Thumby.\n\nHover over 'Project Settings' and left-click 'Set Project Name', set the name to anything you like.\n\n\nFigure 4: Left-clicking 'Set Project Name' under 'Project Settings'\n\n\nClick 'OK' after typing in a name, in this case, we used 'HelloWorld' as the name (without quotes).\n\nThe Thumby should be preloaded a 'Games' and 'lib' folder, each containing files. Left-click any file to open it in a webpage code editor. 'thumby.py' in 'lib' is the main API that should be used to program your projects.\nIf you've done any exploring of the library files, close those editors by left-clicking the 'X' in the header tab of the editor, see the pink arrow in the below image.\n\nFigure 5: Closing any open editors\nOnce all the editors are closed, open a new one by left-clicking 'Add New Editor' in the top panel (see the pink arrow in the below image).\n\nFigure 6: Opening a new editor\nFollow the below steps and enter code as you go to program your first project.\n\nimport the time and math modules that will be used for animating a sprite with respect to time. Also import the thumby module which implements the main API for interacting with buttons and the screen\n\nimport timeimport thumbyimport math\n\nDraw a sprite in the 'Bitmap Builder' panel. First, set the width and height to 32px by clicking the 'Set Width' and 'Set Height' buttons in the 'Bitmap Builder'\nUse mouse left-click to set pixels to black and mouse right-click to set them white\nOnce the sprite is drawn, select a line in the code editor added earlier, then click the 'Export Lines' button in the 'Bitmap Builder' panel - see the below image for the result\n\n\nFigure 7: Result of drawing a sprite and exporting it to code/Python array\n\nCreate a loop where the sprite will be animated bobbing up and down. The first steps every loop are to store the current time in milliseconds and to clear the screen to black.\n\nwhile(1):\n    t0 = time.ticks_ms() \t  # Get the current time in ms\n    thumby.display.fill(0)  # Fill the screen to black to give a 'blank' canvas\n\nAs time goes on create a vertical offset using the sin function. The offset will move the sprite up and down 5px.\n\n\n\n    bobRate = 250 # How fast the animation is (higher is slower, arbitrary)\n    bobRange = 5  # The range in pixels of the bob (how far it moves up/down, -5px to 5px)\n    # The actual offset incorporating time and range (will be applied to the sprite position)\n    bobOffset = math.sin(t0 / bobRate) * bobRange \n\n\n\nNext, use the Thumby screen width and the width of the bitmap to center and calculate the sprite's X and Y location\n\n\n\n    # Center the sprite using screen and bitmap dimensions\n    # Also apply the bob offset from above\n    spriteX = int((thumby.DISPLAY_W/2) - (32/2))\n    spriteY = int(round((thumby.DISPLAY_H/2) - (32/2) + bobOffset))\n\nThe sprite is drawn on the screen, every loop, using the bitmap data array, the sprite X & Y position, and the sprite dimensions\n\n\n    # Display the bitmap by supplying the bitmap data, position, and bitmap dimensions\n    thumby.display.blit(bitmap1, spriteX, spriteY, 32, 32)\n    thumby.display.update()\nThat's it! Before clicking the 'Upload Project' button in the top header, hover over 'File' in the code editor and give the file the same name as your project by left-clicking 'Rename File'. In this case, the project name is 'HelloWorld' so the file was renamed to 'HelloWorld.py'.\nFor your project to show up on the Thumby game select screen, there needs to be one .py file with the same name as the project. Before clicking upload, the webpage and code should look something like the below image:\n\nFigure 8: Setup before clicking upload\nNow click the 'Upload Project' button on the top of the page, disconnect Thumby, power cycle it (turn off and on), use down on the Thumby dpad to find your project, click the left button to select and execute your main project file.\nIf the above code was used, the below animation will play after selecting 'HelloWorld' in the Thumby select screen:\n\n\nOther Webpage Features\n\nExecute a single file on the Thumby at root level '/' using the 'Fast execute' button in any code editor\nImport/export a .py file from/to your computer using the file drop-down in any editor (left-click 'File')\nChange the font size of individual editors using the view drop down (left-click 'View')\nDelete files or directories on the Thumby by left-clicking in the filesystem panel\nOpen files stored in Thumby by right-clicking in filesystem panel\nReset page layout by re-positioning each panel using button under Utilities -> Reset Layout\nReset and erase all page memory using button under Utilities -> Hard Reset Page\nClear and invert buttons in the bitmap builder\nImport exported lines to bitmap builder by selecting bitmap array and comment then left-clicking\nDownload most compatible/tested Thumby MicroPython firmware through Utilities -> Download Firmware button and follow instructions provided when hovering over 'Download Firmware' button\nAll work is automatically saved to the webpage, nothing is lost on a page refresh\n\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact TinyCircuits support or make a post on the TinyCircuits forum.\nShow us what you make by tagging @TinyCircuits on Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook so we can feature it!\nThanks for making with us!",
