And, despite thorough reviews, bugs still make their way into production. Pull requests are neither efficient nor effective; they slow down delivery and contribute to toxic environments."

A common technique is the “Five Whys” popularized by Lean thinking. So we ask “Why did builds not complete” and we find “Kubernetes could not start the pod, and the operation timed out after 1 hour."

Here, we look for the historical traces of cognitive distortions, thinking patterns that are strongly associated with internalizing disorders such as depression and anxiety, in millions of books published over the course of the last two centuries in English, Spanish, and German. We find a pronounced “hockey stick” pattern: Over the past two decades the textual analogs of cognitive distortions surged well above historical levels, including those of World War I and II, after declining or stabilizing for most of the 20th century. Our results point to the possibility that recent socioeconomic changes, new technology, and social media are associated with a surge of cognitive distortions.\n\nPreviously published data were used for this work (<https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html>)."
