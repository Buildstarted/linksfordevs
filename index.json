This article\nanswers this question in the affirmative, by producing such a coefficient. No\nassumptions are needed on the distributions of the variables. There are several\ncoefficients in the literature that converge to 0 if and only if the variables\nare independent, but none that satisfy any of the other properties mentioned\nabove.",
