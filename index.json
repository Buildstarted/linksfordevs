    "Description": "Jetcd is the official Java client library for the etcd coordination service. We show that jetcd contains an improper retry mechanism which allows transactions to execute multiple times, or to appear to fail but actually succeed. To users, these behaviors may appear as lost update, circular information flow, and aborted read. These issues have been outstanding for two and a half years. No patch is available, but disabling the retry mechanism is straightforward. This work was performed independently by Jepsen without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.",
