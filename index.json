If you're like me and have never used Google Duplex, it's a feature of Google Assistant that could make calls on behalf of a person and automatically perform a task, such as booking restaurant tables. While you may have never heard of Google Duplex there's a good chance you've used a generative AI tool like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or GitHub Copilot. Authenticity We’re going to need a way to prove the authenticity of a piece of digital content, everywhere, in a simple manner. This is where public key cryptography comes in. Our current solutions are noble efforts, but remain too complex. It's quite an understatement to say that AI has come a long way since 2018, and yet the blog post's core thesis is even stronger today than when it was written. At the time I was concerned about a future where deepfakes, audio manipulation, and text generation spread across the internet. We're now living in the beginning of that future, this is our present. It has never been faster or easier to generate inorganic content, the tools to do so are more usable and accessible than ever. AI already has us questioning what we see on the internet, and the problem isn't going away. Fake news articles are being written by ChatGPT, fake books are being written with ChatGPT, and of course fake reviews made up by ChatGPT are being used to sell all of this.",
