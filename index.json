During the video I'll go through some practical refactoring that shows how combining some tactical DDD patterns with event sourcing might result in a robust setup.

    "Description": "How does software contribute to military accidents? The stakes are high. During the Cold War, computerized early warning systems produced ‚Äúnear-miss‚Äù nuclear crises. In the future, military AI applications could fail with devastating consequences. To illuminate the causes of military accidents, existing studies apply ‚Äúnormal accidents‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh reliability organizations‚Äù theories. While these frameworks are helpful, they neglect the military‚Äôs system acquisition process, which often outsources software development to contractors and limits input from military end-users. By contrast, the software development lifecycle theory expands the causal timeline of accidents beyond decisions made on the battlefield to those made decades earlier in software design, serving as an antecedent account of how software contributes to military accidents. Illuminating dynamics overlooked by the two dominant approaches, this theory is supported by four cases: the 1988 USS Vincennes shootdown of an Iranian airliner; the 2003 Patriot fratricides; the 2017 USS McCain collision; and software upgrades in the 2021 Kabul airlift.",

    "Description": "Ever wondered how data is actually stored on tapes, floppy disks, and hard drives? We explore the evolution of data encoding formats from NRZI (Non-Return to Zero Inverted) to PE (Phase Encoding), GCR (Group Coded Recording), MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation), and RLL (Run Length Limited). By the end of this video, that alphabet soup of acronyms will make perfect sense!\n\nJoin me as we unravel the challenges of storing digital data on magnetic media and how ingenious encoding schemes have overcome these hurdles. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a vintage computing fan, or just curious about how your data is stored, this video is for you.\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nDave's Attic - Friday 4PM Podcast - https://www.youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nFollow me for updates!  \nTwitter:   @davepl1968 davepl1968\nFacebook: fb.com/davepl",
