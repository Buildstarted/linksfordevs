    "Description": "In the early-to-mid 2010s, there was a renaissance in languages exploring new ways of doing\nconcurrency. In the midst of this renaissance, one abstraction for achieving concurrent operations\nthat was developed was the “future” or “promise” abstraction, which represented a unit of work that\nwill maybe eventually complete, allowing the programmer to use this to manipulate control flow in\ntheir program. Building on this, syntactic sugar called “async/await” was introduced to take futures\nand shape them into the ordinary, linear control flow that is most common. This approach has been\nadopted in many mainstream languages, a series of developments that has been controversial among\npractitioners.",
