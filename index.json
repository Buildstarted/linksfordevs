    "Description": "This article will discuss about implementing an azure function which generate a thumbnail image for a video stored in Azure Storage. In one of the project I am working there is a requirement to extract thumbnail for the video uploaded by user to a Azure Storage Account. This is implemented using .NET and C#. For extracting the video thumbnail - FFMediaToolkit package is used. And I am using ImageSharp package is for saving the image as well. I am using Azure Portal to create the function. You can use the same code if you’re using Visual Studio or VS Code, for the simplicity I am using CSX function. The function is using Windows OS. Platform is 64 Bit. Once you created the function app, create a new function with Blob Trigger."

The Mountain View Buy Nothing group I joined was extremely active – multiple people expressed interest in almost everything I posted, and I was ultimately able to rehome a lot of items. I was surprised how great doing this felt – less profit driven than donating to Goodwill, more “useful” than bringing to the recycling center, more personal than posting on the free section of Craigslist, and more altruistic than selling on eBay (not that I could sell things like miscellaneous light bulbs anyway)."
