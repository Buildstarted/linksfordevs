Over the many years Andras and I have been working on our Cray revival efforts, there has always been a big lag between our available software (and Andras‚Äô amazing simulator) and my FPGA-compatible Verilog implementation. My free time and interests have oscillated wildly over the years, and implementing and debugging hardware is generally everything-intensive. My original cycle-accurate (but buggy) Cray-1 RTL gradually morphed first into a binary-compatible, but less-accurate Cray X-MP (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 24-bit addresses instead of 22-bit), and finally into a binary-compatible and not-at-all cycle-accurate Cray Y-MP/C90/J90 core (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 32-bit addresses). During the final transition, it got a full re-write in System Verilog and a vast simplification in the hopes I‚Äôll someday actually be able to boot up UNICOS on it. That hasn‚Äôt quite happened yet, but it‚Äôs far enough along that I felt it was ready to play around with and make it into a ‚Äòreal‚Äô project. What to do with this? A Cray Wristwatch, of course!",
