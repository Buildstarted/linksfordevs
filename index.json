Now we're adding PostgreSQL to store both webhook subscriptions and delivery attempts, making our system production-ready and resilient.

    "Description": "The mediator design pattern helps to decouple communication between different parts of your system.\n\nIn a hypothetical C# project, that would mean that you don't need to know about the type or the instance of the destination you want your message to go to. You don't really need to know anything concrete about the destination because you'll never have one module talk directly to another!\n\nInstead, we route things through the mediator. The mediator has the responsibility of knowing how to take incoming messages and get them to the right destinations. This means that we use the mediator's API to communicate, and not necessarily the API of the destination directly.\n\nWatch the full video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tyRwBWGjQk\n\n----\nüì® Sign up for my FREE email newsletter:\nhttps://subscribe.devleader.ca\nüó£Ô∏è Share with your network!\n\n#designpatterns #mediator #designpattern #code",
