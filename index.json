You want to ensure the request is valid before you consider processing it.\nAnother important question you need to answer is how you approach different types of validation. For example, I consider input and business validation differently, and each deserves a specific solution.\nI want to show you an elegant solution for validation using MediatR and FluentValidation.\nIf you aren't using CQRS with MediatR, don't worry. Everything I explain about validation can easily be adapted to other paradigms.",

Fulcro is a ClojureScript library, but it uses some heavy macros - and those typically require JVM Clojure. Well, not anymore. I was able to rewrite them into Borkdude’s Small Clojure Interpreter (SCI) dialect of Clojure. I.e. I can ask SCI to evaluate a piece of code with these macros, which SCI will macro-expand into more cljs, and execute. With SCI, my Fulcro sci.configs, CodeMirror, and Nextjournal’s clojure-mode, I can have a beautiful in-page editor with code evaluation. And I will show you how to do the same, for your blog.",
