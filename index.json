Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\nGet the source code here: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic\n\nIn this practical walkthrough, I explore how AI can transform the often tedious process of writing unit tests for .NET applications. Starting with a tour of my semi-complex .NET project, I explain its real-world use cases and demonstrate some existing test implementations. The video reveals why providing AI (specifically using Cursor) with example tests dramatically improves its ability to generate high-quality unit tests that match your coding standards and patterns. Watch as I demonstrate the complete workflow - from generating unit tests for the Domain layer to troubleshooting and fixing AI-generated code errors, and finally running the successful tests in Visual Studio.\n\nWe'll then extend the approach to the Application layer, showing how this technique can be applied across different parts of your architecture. Whether you're looking to reduce testing bottlenecks or improve your coverage, this step-by-step guide shows exactly how AI can become a valuable addition to your .NET development toolkit.\n\nWorking with LLMs in .NET using Microsoft.Extensions.AI\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/working-with-llms-in-dotnet-using-microsoft-extensions-ai\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 My recommendations\n2:53 Cursor and .cursorrules\n3:42 Domain unit testing with Cursor\n7:34 Reviewing AI-generated tests\n9:09 Application layer unit tests",
