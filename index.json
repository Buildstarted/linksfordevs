You only have a certain amount of shown results even though there are millions. So Google has pages (like in a book) where you can go forth and back.\nThis has multiple advantages: First from a UX point of view you only show a reasonable amount of data to your user. The second benefit is for your API / DB as it only has to load a small page instead of the whole book.\n",
