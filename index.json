    "Description": "I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flightâ€™s wifi, but without access to the internet.\nI was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland. Itâ€™s a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwestâ€™s wifi portal wouldnâ€™t accept any form of payment. The web page didnâ€™t give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browserâ€™s network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong.",
