In 1981 nearly half of smokers knew cigarettes were bad for you but people could not quit [1]. I believe social media is currently at that stage since nearly half of Gen Z wishes social media was never invented [2]. As a member of Gen Z myself, I wrote this piece to help my fellow generation mates quit.  I will go the problem with social media, and how I was able to quit.",
