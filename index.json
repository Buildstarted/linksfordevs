    "Description": "Many cloud providers offer an ‘instance metadata’ service. Each refers to it with a different name but I’ll just call it IMDS hereafter. The IMDS is a HTTP interface exposed to VM instances which provides information about the instance itself, and often temporary credentials that can be used to interact with cloud APIs. In Google Cloud, these credentials belong to the service account assigned to the instance and can be used to perform any action the service account can. In AWS, the credentials belong to the instance profile and can perform any action that the assigned role can perform.",
