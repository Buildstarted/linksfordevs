They claimed that the synthesized LK-99 materials exhibit the\nMeissner levitation phenomenon of superconductors and have a superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) higher than 400 K. Here, for the first time, we\nsuccessfully verify and synthesize the LK-99 crystals which can be magnetically\nlevitated with larger levitated angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room\ntemperature.

I provide a brief overview of efforts to address these challenges and highlight some limitations we’re encountering.\nSubsequently, I introduce an alternative method of performance testing called paired benchmarking, which effectively tackles some of these challenges. While paired testing is a well-known statistical technique, as far as I am aware, it has not yet been implemented in any benchmarking tools.",

They exist because selling enterprise software requires deep technical knowledge that salespeople typical don’t have. The salesperson establishes rapport with the prospect and understands their business needs.",
