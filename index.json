    "Description": "More than 63%+ of organizations said in a Dzone survey that they are adopting Microservices for some or all of their applications.\nAs more businesses adopt the use of Microservice architectures, we as developers have to become more skilled with Microservices communication.\nWorking with distributed systems is both fun and challenging at the same time. One of those challenges is designing effective communication between services.\nMore centralization or less centralization? More coupling or less coupling? More control or less control?\nThese are only a few questions you need to answer.\nIn this week's newsletter, we will:\n- Break down Orchestration vs. Choreography - Understand key differences and tradeoffs between them - Create a framework for deciding which approach to use\nLet's dive in!",
