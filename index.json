    "Description": "Nearly all programs are written to access virtual memory addresses, which the CPU must translate to physical addresses. These translations are usually fast because the mappings are cached in the CPU's Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Unfortunately, virtual memory on x86 has used a 4 kiB page size since the 386 was released in 1985, when computers had a bit less memory than they do today. Also unfortunately, TLBs are pretty small because they need to be fast. For example, AMD's Zen 4 Microarchitecture, which first shipped in September 2022, has a first level data TLB with 72 entries, and a second level TLB with 3072 entries. This means when an application's working set is larger than approximately 4 kiB × 3072 = 12 MiB, some memory accesses will require page table lookups, multiplying the number of memory accesses required. This is a brand-new CPU, with one of the biggest TLBs on the market, so most systems will be worse. Using larger virtual memory page sizes (aka huge pages) can reduce page mapping overhead substantially. Since RAM is so much larger than it was in 1985, a larger page size seems like obviously a good idea to me.",
