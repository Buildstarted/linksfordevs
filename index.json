We will answer questions from chat while playing.\nIt will most likely take place next Monday. We will let you know about the details in our next update.\nOn to today's special...\n\nWater surface simulation on the NES \nIn this update, we will dive into how the water surface animations work in Böbl.\n\n\n\nSurely, this has to be the most interesting technical detail about Böbl as it is something that has never been seen on the 8-bit NES before.\n\nROM versus RAM for graphics\nOn the NES, you have the choice to equip your cartridge with either a ROM or RAM chip for graphics. These are called CHR ROM and CHR RAM respectively.\n\nCHR ROM\nPros\n\n  Graphics don't have to be stored in Program ROM, leaving more space for code and other data, i.e. more game content \n  With a memory mapper like MMC3, you can update many tiles at once with no CPU cost by swapping banks of CHR ROM\n\nCons\n\n  You are usually limited to only a couple predefined frames of animation \n\n\n\n\nCHR RAM\nPros\n\n  Can modify individual graphic tiles during runtime, i.e. draw on them or replace them\n  Easy to achieve highly fluid animations \n  Allows for novel graphical effects \n\nCons\n\n  Graphics have to be stored in Program ROM before they are uploaded to CHR RAM, so you may have to sacrifice game content \n  Tile updates require CPU involvement, so there's a severe limit to how many tiles you can animate at the same time\n\n\n\n\nThe NES game Battletoads uses CHR RAM to create interesting graphical effects, like the screen edges scrolling vertically at different speeds.\nHere's a close-up of the CHR RAM contents:\n\n\n\nOn to another example:\nContra... aka Probotector if you're from Europe like us ;)\n\n\n\nIf there's only a few tiles you need to update, CHR RAM wins. Because CHR ROM bankswitching only works in 1KB chunks, so you would waste a lot of space duplicating graphics.\nMore importantly, here you can easily see why background animations are useful:\nWhile it would be much easier to use sprites for an animated electric barrier like this, if you try to line up more than 8 sprites horizontally on the NES, excess ones disappear - which games try to circumvent using the infamous sprite flickering.\nHowever, for background tiles, there is no such limit! Everything looks just fine.\n\nAnimating the water surface\nAs stated earlier, the number of graphics updates the NES can do per frame is very limited.\nA screen in Böbl can have a maximum of 32 animated water surface tiles. That's the bottom two rows of tiles on the right side (CHR RAM) of this image:\n\n\n\n To reach this number of tile updates, we use two tricks:\nHalf of the colors\nThe 4-color (2-bit) graphic format on the NES uses 16 bytes per 8x8-pixel tile. Böbl's water surface tiles use just 2 colors (1-bit), that means we get away with updating only 8 bytes per tile.\n\n\n\n\nHalf of the frame rate\nUpdates alternate: 16 tiles on even frames, the other 16 on odd frames. This means the water surface animation runs at 30fps while the rest of the game runs at 60fps. Luckily, everything still looks fluid (pun intended).\n\nNext, let's see how the water surface simulation itself works: \nThink of a water surface as a sequence of points. Each one describes the water level at a given x-position.\n\n\n\n\nWhen an object hits the water surface, the vertical velocity of the of one such point is changed and it will effectively swing back and forth around the surface level. Over time, the water level will propagate to adjacent points, losing momentum in the process. Eventually, all points will return back to forming a still surface again.\nPulling this off convincingly would require a fair bit of memory and math, possibly including divisions, which are extremely slow on the poor 8-bit CPU housed inside the NES.\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, the CPU does well at addition and subtraction. So our solution was to pre-generate the water deformation. I.e., we store the changes caused to the water level as a sort of animation - a sequence of numbers telling the game how much the water level should go up or down for a given point, at a particular point in time.\n\n\n\nThen we generate the graphics tiles from the calculated levels of all water surface points with some optimized assembly code (click if you dare).\nEven with all of these optimizations, the game uses 40-60% of the CPU just for the water deformation effect.\n\nMooore, please?\nJust like last time, if you are interested in learning about our process of creating NES  games and working around 8-bit hardware limitations, we invite you to check our Ko-Fi page, where you can find more posts like this one.\nThanks for reading and we hope you enjoyed this update ☺️ \nHave a nice day!\nJulius and Nicolas",
