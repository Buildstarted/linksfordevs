Here, we delve into their practical applications, discussing their significance in Zero-Knowledge circuits, the Mina blockchain, and the O1JS framework. Additionally, we will examine how recursive zkSNARKs fuel applications like zkLocus, enabling users to authenticate and share their location while preserving privacy. By the end of this post, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of Zero-Knowledge applications, Zero-Knowledge ciructis, zkSNARKs, recursive zkSNARKs, and what exactly is visible to the verifier when a recursive proof is passed as a private input in a zkSNARKs circuit.",
