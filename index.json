We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie \"GaProgMan\" Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Thomas Sylvest joined us to talk about both Resilient Programming and Cleipnir .NET - a framework that Thomas worked on to implement the concepts of Resilient Programming in .NET applications. Cleipnir, and Resilient Programming, are fantastic for supporting message-driven architectures; whether you've built a monolith, series of microservices, or anything in between.\r\n\r\n \"But the idea is the same, kind of like that you try and remember the result of actions that you've done in a way that if you then start again, you won't... you kind of like you'll check in your little notebook if you already performed this action. If you did then you'll just return the result of the previous execution. If you look in your in your notebook and you can see, 'okay actually I haven't done this before' you will then perform the action\"‚Äî Thomas Sylvest\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/cleipnir-and-beyond-on-resilient-development-practices-with-thomas-sylvest/\r\n\r\n Useful Links  Paxos Raft Polly .NET Hangfire Quartz Inbox and outbox pattern Idempotence  Azure Durable Functions Mass Transit Rebus NServiceBus Thomas on LinkedIn Microsoft Open: Introduction to Cleipnir.Flows a tool to get resilient code  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
