    "Description": "Peer review, one of the staples of modern research, has a somewhat\nweird reputation: on the one hand, society recognises that there should\nbe a way to assess the correctness of scientific claims.1 On the other\nhand, researchers are loath to relinquish control to their peers, who,\ntypically, provide anonymous feedback. This latter opinion is typically\njustified by explaining that the incentives2 are not in favour of the\nauthors here: the default position for many journals and many\nconferences seems to be ‘reject unless proven to be sufficiently good,’\nmeaning that it is much easier for reviewers to suggest\nrejection than to engage with the content in a meaningful manner.",

It was hard to do research on this topic because most queries returned results from blogs that showed how to implement a drag and drop component using React DnD and similar libraries but did not show how to persist the new order in a database.",
