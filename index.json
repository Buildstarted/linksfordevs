In fact, the LGCP is an extension of the NHPP, in that a latent correlation structure is included in the point process model. Specifically, the LGCP uses a Gaussian Random Field to characterize the intensity of the point process. Doing so allows us to take into account spatial or temporal correlation across our region or period of interest. Statistically, this is quite advantageous compared to the NHPP where spatial correlation could only be accounted for via covariates. Not including such correlation structure means that you then assume the covariates included in your model are sufficient to account for spatial fluctuations in the response variable. However, the inclusion of the random field presents mathematical and computational challenges.",
