Here's a naive recursive tree hash\nbased on SHA-3 in Python, which turns out to be vulnerable to these\nattacks:‚ÄãDividing the length by 2 at each level of the tree like this is a\nshortcut, but the resulting tree structure isn't great, because we have to\nknow the final input length to figure out where any of the leaf or subtree\nboundaries are. That's no problem in these examples, but in practice most\nhash functions need to be able to \"stream\" long inputs in a loop\nwithout knowing the final length until the end. A better splitting rule for\nreal tree hashes is to make the left side as large as possible as long as\nit's a power-of-2. See the BLAKE3 paper, particularly sections 2.1 and\n5.1.2, and also Binary Numeral Trees.",
