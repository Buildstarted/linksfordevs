A cryptographic hash, also often referred to as a ‚Äúdigest‚Äù, ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù or ‚Äúsignature‚Äù, is an almost perfectly unique string of characters that is generated from a separate piece of input text. For example, SHA-256 generates a 256-bit (32-byte) signature.\nFurther down in this article, we will break down each step of SHA 256‚Äôs cryptographic algorithm and work through a real example by hand.",
