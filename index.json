    "Description": "The release of Deepseek R1 has made headlines, but the unsung hero is its sibling: R1 Zero. While R1 showcases reasoning through human feedback, R1 Zero demonstrates something far more transformative—reasoning without human feedback. This works only in analytical tasks like math and coding, but it removes the cost of hiring humans for feedback (bye, bye, Scale AI). This shift is poised to divide the AI landscape into two: analytical AI (like R1 Zero) that will thrive without human feedback, and creative AI (like ChatGPT-4) that relies on human feedback for understanding human ambiguity.This moment marks AI’s Vertical SaaS transformation, but not in the way we expected. For years, we assumed AI verticalization would be domain-specific—targeting industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics. Instead, the future of AI lies in intelligence-specific verticals: analytical and creative intelligences, much like how people are—some are more left-brained (analytical), while others are more right-brained (creative).How R1 Zero Achieves Deterministic ReasoningTraditional AI models like GPT rely on probabilistic reasoning, predicting the most likely sequence of words or outcomes. This requires human feedback to address the ambiguities of human language through a technique called supervised fine-tuning (SFT). R1 Zero, however, focuses on verifiable outcomes like chess or math using reinforcement learning (RL), eliminating the need for human feedback. Here’s how it works:Reinforcement Learning with Binary Rewards:R1 Zero trains on tasks where outputs are either correct or incorrect, like solving math problems or generating code. This allows the system to refine its reasoning iteratively without relying on expensive, human-labeled datasets.Execution and Validation:After generating a solution, R1 Zero executes it (e.g., running a program or applying a formula) to confirm its correctness. This ensures repeatable, deterministic outputs—a stark contrast to the variability of LLMs.Narrow Focus:R1 Zero excels in structured tasks like coding or financial modeling by avoiding ambiguous, subjective problems. Its narrow specialization enables higher accuracy and efficiency.For example, imagine you’re solving how far a ladder needs to be placed to reach 12 feet on a wall with a 13-foot ladder. R1 Zero would apply the Pythagorean theorem deterministically to calculate the correct result every time—placing the base 5 feet from the wall. This ability to reason and execute precise logic makes it incredibly powerful for analytical tasks. (For more details, see my earlier essay on how reasoning AI thinks).Why R1 Zero Matters More Than R1Analytical Intelligence Will Be a Cottage Industry:By avoiding reliance on costly data labeling or human feedback, R1 Zero allows smaller companies to build low-cost, deterministic AI systems. Startups can now create AI for niche tasks like coding or math because they don’t need to hire people to clean up the data for training. They can run RL, which only requires compute costs instead of people costs.Super Intelligence Will Be Like a Ferrari:While LLMs like GPT excel in creative and ambiguous tasks, R1 Zero specializes in precision and logic. Together, they can form a mixture of experts, as I had predicted in my super intelligence article. This will be useful for high end tasks like scientific research, but doing both might be expensive. So, they may struggle to compete with analytical intelligence startups on pricing. They'll need to price tokens differently only for analytical tasks, which will complicate pricing.Will Desktops Replace Mainframes?Eventually, analytical intelligence like R1 Zero might become cheaper to build and deploy on low-end devices like desktops, robots, or phones. They may not even need to connect to multi-billion-dollar AI clusters. This is reminiscent of desktops taking over mainframes, as explained by Clayton Christensen in his book The Innovator’s Dilemma, where disruption happens when a cheaper product—like analytical intelligence—becomes increasingly capable, pushing super intelligence into niche applications and eventually making it less relevant.In essence, this is a Vertical SaaS moment for AI. We are witnessing the birth of intelligence-specific verticalization:Analytical Intelligence: Deterministic reasoning for math, logic, and coding. (e.g., R1 Zero)Creative Intelligence: Generating ideas, designs, and narratives. (e.g., ChatGPT-4)Artistic Intelligence: Producing visuals, music, and other forms of artistic expression. (e.g., DALL-E)This shift mirrors the rise of vertical SaaS in software, where tools went from Shopify to Toast to Slice and became narrowly focused on one vertical. Similary, AI will become specialized intelligences, with analytical intelligence leading the way.SummarySo far, humans have economically valued analytical skills more than artistic skills, leading to a world where logical reasoning and structured problem-solving dominate white-collar jobs. But what happens when analytical AI becomes not only smarter but also far cheaper than artistic AI?Consider this: tools like Stockfish are available to every chess player, but no one allows it to play on behalf of the player. Now imagine analytical AI systems replacing financial analysts, engineers, or coders. Will we still value these roles as highly when the \"intelligence\" behind them is automated?This isn’t just a shift in how we think about AI—it’s a shift in how we value human skills. Analytical intelligence is coming, and it will reshape not just industries but our economy and our sense of purpose in a world where reasoning machines take over tasks we once prized most.",

Includes the entire lifecycle from a prototype ML model to an entire system deployed in production. Covers also responsible AI (including safety, security, fairness, explainability) and MLOps. For earlier offerings see websites for Fall 2019, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021  Spring 2022, Fall 2022, Spring 2023, Spring 2024, and Fall 2024. This Spring 2025 offering is designed for students with some data science experience (e.g., has taken a machine learning course, has used sklearn) and basic programming skills (e.g., basic Python programming with libraries, can navigate a Unix shell), but will not expect a software engineering background (i.e., experience with testing, requirements, architecture, process, or teams is not required). Going forward we expect to offer this course at least every spring semester and possibly some fall semesters (not summer semesters).",
