The interface it currently has is a method called poll_next, which is a “poll”\nmethod like Future::poll. Poll methods are very “low-level” and are harder to write correctly than\nasync functions. Some people would like to see AsyncIterator shifted to have an async next method,\nsimply the “asyncified” Iterator trait.",
