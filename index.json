I had high hopes of capturing my own version of this rugged terrain, expecting to find inspiration in the remote landscapes and the challenge of shooting in unpredictable weather. After finally making the journey, I left feeling uninspired, frustrated, and disappointed. And honestly? I have no desire to go back. Here’s why. Too Many People, Too Few Moments When I imagined Patagonia, I pictured solitude—standing in awe at towering mountains all to myself. The reality?",

    "Description": "In multiplayer, first-person shooter games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO),\n                        coordinated movement is a critical component of high-level strategic play. However, the\n                        complexity of team coordination and the variety of conditions present in popular game maps\n                        make it impractical to author hand-crafted movement policies for every scenario. We show\n                        that it is possible to take a data-driven approach to creating human-like movement\n                        controllers for CS:GO. We curate a team movement dataset comprising 123 hours of\n                        professional game play traces, and use this dataset to train a transformer-based movement\n                        model that generates human-like team movement for all players in a \"Retakes\" round of the\n                        game. Importantly, the movement prediction model is efficient. Performing inference for all\n                        players takes less than 0.5 ms per game step (amortized cost) on a single CPU core, making\n                        it plausible for use in commercial games today. Human evaluators assess that our model\n                        behaves more like humans than both commercially-available bots and procedural movement\n                        controllers scripted by experts (16% to 59% higher by TrueSkill rating of \"human-like\").\n                        Using experiments involving in-game bot vs. bot self-play, we demonstrate that our model\n                        performs simple forms of teamwork, makes fewer common movement mistakes, and yields movement\n                        distributions, player lifetimes, and kill locations similar to those observed in\n                        professional CS:GO match play.",

And two years ago, my goal was to provide a solution that could take you from code to cloud in 45 minutes or less. So I wanted it to be \"file new project\" to deploy a solution on Azure—because that's where my main focus is—within 45 minutes.\"— Jason Taylor\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie \"GaProgMan\" Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Jason Taylor (no relation) joined us to talk about his journey from Classic ASP to .NET and Azure. He also discusses clean architecture’s maintainability, and his open-source Clean Architecture Solution template for ASP .NET Core, along with strategies for learning new frameworks and dealing with complexity.\r\n\r\n \"Right now the template supports PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. If you want to support MySQL, it's relatively easy to do because there's already a Bicep module or a Terraform module that you can go in and use it. So I went from 45 minutes to now I can get things up and running in like, I don't know, two minutes of effort and 15 minutes of waiting around while I make my coffee\"— Jason Taylor\r\n\r\n Along the way, we talk about some of the complexities involved with creating a template which supports multiple different frontend technologies and .NET Aspire (which was news to me when we recorded), all the while maintaining the goal of being the simplest approach for enterprise development with Clean Architecture.\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/from-code-to-cloud-in-15-minutes-jason-taylors-expert-insights-and-the-clean-architecture-template/\r\n\r\n Jason's Links:  Jason's Clean Architecture repo on GitHub Jason's Northwind Traders with Clean Architecture repo on Github Connect with Jason Jason's RapidBlazor repo on GitHub  Other Links:   C# DevKit for Visual Studio Code  Code, Coffee, and Clever Debugging: Leslie Richardson's Microsoft Journey and the C# Dev Kit in Visual Studio Code with Leslie Richardson  dotnet scaffold devcontainers  .NET Aspire  Azure Developer CLI GitHub CLI Obsidian  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
