    "Description": "After finishing my last post on how to convert getpocket links to epub I was thinking a lot about my current workflow, how I manage to capture everything that might be interesting for me and save it for later use.

After four months, NIST selected 32 of the candidates for the second round. In March 2021, NIST announced 10 finalists to move forward to the final round of the selection process. The finalists are ASCON, Elephant, GIFT-COFB, Grain-128AEAD, ISAP, PHOTON-Beetle, Romulus, SPARKLE, TinyJAMBU, and Xoodyak. This report describes the evaluation criteria and selection process, which is based on public feedback and internal review of the second-round candidates."
