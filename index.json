    "Description": "As computer programming becomes more central to the workforce, the need for better models of how it is effectively learned has become more apparent. The current study addressed this gap by recording electrophysiological brain responses as 62 Python programmers with varying skill levels read lines of code with manipulations of form (syntax) and meaning (semantics). At the group level, results showed that manipulations of form resulted in P600 effects, with syntactically invalid code generating more positive deflections in the 500–800&nbsp;ms range than syntactically valid code. Meaning manipulations resulted in N400 effects, with semantically implausible code generating more negative deflections in the 300–500&nbsp;ms range than semantically plausible code. Greater Python expertise within the group was associated with greater sensitivity to violations in form. These results support the notion that skilled programming, like skilled natural language learning, is associated with the incorporation of rule-based knowledge into online comprehension processes. Conversely, programmers at all skill levels showed neural sensitivity to meaning manipulations, suggesting that reliance on pre-existing semantic relationships facilitates code comprehension across skill levels.",

The current iterations of Wi-Fi are admittedly very fast, but I feel a bit iffy trusting that the signal will always work at a good latency, when there's rogue slabs of concrete and surprise microwave sources to deal with. My house has fiber internet which terminates at the wireless router I keep under my TV. To enable mission-critical house activities (e.g. streaming from my studio to Twitch/Diode Zone, using Steam Link from the couch), I have some Powerline Ethernet adapters which link the router to my studio PC upstairs. And for the past several years, they have been indistinguishable from magic; somehow they turn 1970s home electrical wiring into Cat 5e! Until the rubber finally met the road; I tried to watch a Blu-Ray on my Home Theatre PC, streamed from my Studio PC, and it had big buffering pauses every 60 seconds. An early speed test I did showed the link speed for streaming the Blu-Ray was only 24 Mbps! But for some reason, downloading things from the studio PC was absolutely fine! At this point I realised I knew very little about how the magic boxes worked, or how I would go about isolating the problem.",
