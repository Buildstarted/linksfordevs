With some aggressive google searching, I was able to find a list of the best Linux distro building kits. Before you start building any distros it may be a good idea to look into how KVM works and learn the models behind the Linux Kernel Architecture. Moving on, I happened to stumble upon a decent and easy-to-use Ubuntu ISO Creator. This app gives you the ability to reconcile your settings and updates before the disk has been created. Let’s take a closer look at what building a Ubuntu distro was like, using Cubic. You’re going to need a Linux machine and for this lab, so I’ll be firing up a virtual machine and allocating the necessary RAM and Processing speed to create an ISO image. You will also need a blank ISO to build your custom distro with, I downloaded a bare-bones Xubuntu ISO here. The keys and installation methods:",
