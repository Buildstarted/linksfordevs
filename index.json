I have a soft spot for tape media; there’s something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though QIC tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.",
