Upgrading to it was - and for the time being, remains to be - as simple as changing the URL from which the release is downloaded. Over time, the way Forgejo is governed and developed evolved. To be able to provide stable, secure, reliable releases, Forgejo requires a reasonable effort made at writing tests for each change that goes into the code. This has worked out remarkably well, as it caught both regressions in imported code, and mistakes in proposed changes. Furthermore, Forgejo has accepted features and other changes that are not available in Gitea, and has diverged in other ways already.",

In this post, I’m going to pontificate on whether web applications are truly less trustworthy than native applications, especially in an E2EE setting, and if so, how we should bridge the gap. The gap is narrower than it appears at first glance, especially with desktop applications. To close it, though, the devil is in the (UX- and deployment-related) details.",

In other words, the change needs to be backward compatible. Sure, there are cases when you’ll have to make breaking changes, but it’s usually better to avoid that. In the case of company-internal packages, when you can modify both the library and the app that consumes it, there are a few nifty patterns to deal with API changes.",
