By using a payment processing scenario, I'll illustrates how to store processed event information in caches or databases to avoid duplicate handling\n\nThe video provides a detailed example of implementing idempotency with .NET and emphasizes the importance of being equipped to handle duplicate events to ensure system reliability.\n\n00:00 Introduction and Payment Glitch Scenario\n00:25 Understanding Event-Driven Architectures\n01:21 The Importance of Idempotency\n03:24 Implementing Idempotency with Unique Identifiers\n06:00 Practical Example: Payment Service in .NET\n11:20 Conclusion and Best Practices\n\nCode - https://github.com/jeastham1993/PlantBasedPizza/tree/azure",

In reality, they are largely additive: you don't have to fetch your data on the server and you don't have to run a server at all. What React Server Components do is give you optionality to decide where you want your code to run: the server, the client, or both. And when: build-time or run-time. It gives you the ability to move between those environments seamlessly through composition. For experts who want freedom of choice, RSCs are a powerful solution. If you find them confusing, it's because nothing like them has existed before, but once you internalize their design, you'll see why their ideas will live on for a long time.",
