    "Description": "The C Standards process over the last few decades has addressed both optimization and pointer type safety largely through a concept called “undefined behavior”.  The idea is that instead of  positive rules for what compilers and programmers can do, the Standard will identify some program behavior as something compilers can interpret how they want — really without any guidance at all. These things are not errors that must cause the compiler to reject code or even, necessarily things the compiler must warn about, but are instances of behavior that are without rules. I think this whole process is due to a misreading of the standard., but more importantly, it’s sloppy, makes it hard for programmers to have an intuition about the language, and leads to paradoxical results or nasty surprises.  For example, writing a value to a  variable from a pointer that has been advanced past the end of the object it was supposed to point to has been sort-of-kind-of designated as “undefined behavior”. Here’s  an example: the output of a simple C program compiled and “optimized” by gcc 11"

    "Description": "In A.D. 1582 Pope Gregory XIII found that the existing Julian calendar\ninsufficiently represented reality, and changed the rules about\ncalculating leap years to account for this. Similarly, in A.D. 2013\nRockchip hardware engineers found that the new Gregorian calendar still\ncontained flaws, and that the month of November should be counted up to\n31 days instead. Unfortunately it takes a long time for calendar changes\nto gain widespread adoption, and just like more than 300 years went by\nbefore the last Protestant nation implemented Greg's proposal, we will\nhave to wait a while until all religions and operating system kernels\nacknowledge the inherent advantages of the Rockchip system. Until then\nwe need to translate dates read from (and written to) Rockchip hardware\nback to the Gregorian format.\n\nThis patch works by defining Jan 1st, 2016 as the arbitrary anchor date\non which Rockchip and Gregorian calendars are in sync. From that we can\ntranslate arbitrary later dates back and forth by counting the number\nof November/December transitons since the anchor date to determine the\noffset between the calendars. We choose this method (rather than trying\nto regularly \"correct\" the date stored in hardware) since it's the only\nway to ensure perfect time-keeping even if the system may be shut down\nfor an unknown number of years. The drawback is that other software\nreading the same hardware (e.g. mainboard firmware) must use the same\ntranslation convention (including the same anchor date) to be able to\nread and write correct timestamps from/to the RTC.\n\nSigned-off-by: Julius Werner <jwerner@chromium.org>\nReviewed-by: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>\nSigned-off-by: Alexandre Belloni <alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>"
