    "Description": "Mitchel Sellers is globally known as a 15-time Microsoft MVP, an ASPInsider, a DNN MVP, an MCP (Microsoft .NET, ASP.NET, and SQL Server), and CEO of IowaComputerGurus Inc. Sellers has a deep understanding of software development and, when speaking, focuses on proper architecture standards, performance, stability, security, and overall cost-effectiveness of delivered solutions. This message and his abilities resonate in the technical war room as well as the executive board room. &nbsp; Mitchel is a prolific public speaker, presenting more than 400 sessions at user groups and conferences globally, such as DevUp, SDN, and Code PaLOUsa. Sellers has been the author of multiple books and a regular blogger on technology topics. &nbsp; When Mitchel is not working in technology, you will find him flying his airplane, teaching others how to fly, or spending time with his family. He is also actively involved in the Open Source Community working diligently to further the movement. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:02] Congrats to Mitchel on his election to a leadership position at the .NET foundation. [3:41] What is the .NET Foundation? [5:58] What about .NET Maui catches Mitchel’s attention, and is it really ready for us to go for it? [6:40] Official support for Xamarin Forms is going to be ending officially in early 2024. [8:48] The .NET Maui Blazor hybrid model. [10:22] What has been Mitchel’s experience pushing Maui applications to the various app stores? [13:00] The most applicable patterns when you are laying out the spread of a Maui application. [16:10] The preference for a centralized location. [21:49] The tendency to overlook analytics. [22:57] What does the analytics and telemetry suite look like, and what are the users doing with the application? [25:01] Tools like App Insights from Azure can be awesome, but they can also get very expensive. [27:10] What is the DevOps story for Maui applications these days from continuous integration and automated testing to deployments and versioning? [31:12] Using GitHub actions, which of the steps require certain operating-system-hosted agents? [34:37] What is next for Maui, both traditional and using the Blazor hybrid? [37:40] Where can we find Mitchel next? &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episodes:     — New Video Podcast!

    "Description": "A recent paper [Lee {\u001bm et al.}, J. Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\bf\n33}, 61 (2023)] provides some experimental indications that\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with $x\u0007pprox 1$, coined LK-99, might be a\nroom-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional\ntheory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with $x$\n-- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu$^{2+}$ in\na $3d^9$ configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi\nenergy. This puts Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O in an ultra-correlated regime and\nsuggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If\ndoped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or\nan correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without\nsuperconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results.",
