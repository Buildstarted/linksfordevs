PyBind11 is the most popular tool for the job not the quickest. NanoBind offers improvements, but when speed really matters, we turn to pure CPython C API bindings. With StringZilla, I started with PyBind11 but switched to CPython to reduce latency. The switch did demand more coding effort, moving from modern C++17 to more basic C99, but the result is a 5x lower call latency!",
