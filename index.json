    "Description": "In December 1999, NASA's Mars Polar Lander was on a pioneering mission to explore Mars' south pole, aiming to unlock secrets about the planet's climate and the possibility of water ice beneath its surface. Equipped with cutting-edge technology and years of meticulous planning, the spacecraft represented a significant leap forward in planetary exploration.\n\nBut as the lander approached the Martian atmosphere, an unseen flaw lurked within its software‚Äîa tiny error buried deep in the code controlling its descent and landing sequence. This subtle glitch caused the lander to misinterpret vibrations from its leg deployment as a confirmation of touchdown while it was still high above the Martian surface. Acting on this false signal, the onboard computer prematurely shut down the descent engines.\n\nWith its engines off and no parachute to slow its fall, the Mars Polar Lander plummeted silently to the Red Planet, disappearing without a trace. Back on Earth, engineers and scientists were left in stunned silence, their hopes for groundbreaking discoveries dashed by a single overlooked line of code.\n\nThis documentary delves into the intricate world of spacecraft engineering and software development, unraveling how a minor software oversight led to the loss of a $165 million mission. Through expert interviews and detailed analysis, we explore the challenges of designing autonomous systems for space exploration, the critical importance of rigorous testing, and the lessons learned from this poignant failure.\n\nJoin us as we journey into the heart of the Mars Polar Lander's story‚Äîa compelling tale of human ambition, technological complexity, and the razor-thin line between triumph and catastrophe in the quest to explore the cosmos.\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nDave's Attic - Friday 4PM Podcast - https://www.youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nFollow me for updates!  \nTwitter:   @davepl1968 davepl1968\nFacebook: fb.com/davepl",

    "Description": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.",
