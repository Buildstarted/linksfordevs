But when I started observing and talking to people I consider successful, I noticed they don‚Äôt do anything extraordinary. In fact, they do quite the opposite. They follow ‚Äúboring‚Äù advice I already heard a million times in proverbs, religious and old philosophy stories, and even from my grandma. And it makes sense!.

Texans expressed more worry about the surging pandemic and its effects than in June, and gave Governor Abbott the lowest job approval rating of his tenure in office. A majority ‚Äì 52% ‚Äì¬† said the state is headed in the wrong direction, the worst assessment of the direction of the state since the inception of this polling project in 2008."
