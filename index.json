Do non-human animals learn to associate human speech with specific objects in everyday life? We examined whether cats matched familiar cats‚Äô names and faces (Exp.1) and human family members‚Äô names and faces (Exp.2). Cats were presented with a photo of the familiar cat‚Äôs face on a laptop monitor after hearing the same cat‚Äôs name or another cat‚Äôs name called by the subject cat‚Äôs owner (Exp.1) or an experimenter (Exp.2). Half of the trials were in a congruent condition where the name and face matched, and half were in an incongruent (mismatch) condition. Results of Exp.1 showed that household cats paid attention to the monitor for longer in the incongruent condition, suggesting an expectancy violation effect; however, caf√© cats did not. In Exp.2, cats living in larger human families were found to look at the monitor for increasingly longer durations in the incongruent condition. Furthermore, this tendency was stronger among cats that had lived with their human family for a longer time, although we could not rule out an effect of age. This study provides evidence that cats link a companion's name and corresponding face without explicit training.",
