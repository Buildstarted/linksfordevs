We will look at the consequences of the mapping on the generated SQL and consider the performance and storage implications.

    "Description": "In this episode, I was joined by Martin Thwaites from Honeycomb to chat about OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry (or OTel) standardises metrics, logs, and traces - allowing different systems and languages to be able to write telemetry data in a common format and be understood by any visualisation UIs that support it. This is becoming widely adopted, meaning that with minor changes to your applications - you can ship off telemetry to various combinations of providers, giving you much more choice and flexibility.",

Set in Worcester, Massachusetts, the show explores the life of Allison McRoberts (played by Annie Murphy), a woman struggling to redefine her life amid an unhappy marriage to her husband Kevin, an insensitive, unambitious man-child. The show presents contrasting perspectives of her experience: as a stereotypical sitcom wife when Allison is with her husband Kevin, shown with a multiple-camera setup and canned laughter, and as a woman navigating a difficult personal path, filmed in the single-camera setup more common to television dramas.[1]",
