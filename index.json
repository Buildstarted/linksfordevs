The size of the room was constrained, because you remembered how long it took to walk around the outside. Given your means and taste, it was appropriately furnished. Perhaps you walked into the room because you forgot where you left your keys, and encountered a lovely couch (green, your favourite) and found the keys wedged between the cushions. This made perfect sense because you remembered sitting in that room. But, when you were there, you actually sat on a red couch, and didn’t have your keys.

Unfortunately, the performance of queries of all three gets substantially slower (2-10×) for values larger than about 2 kiB, due to how Postgres stores long variable-length data (TOAST). The same performance cliff applies to any variable-length types, like TEXT and BYTEA. This article contains some quick-and-dirty benchmark results to explore how Postgres's performance changes for the \"schemaless\" data types when they become large. My conclusion is that you should expect a 2-10× slower queries once a row gets larger than Postgres's 2 kiB limit.",
