Sometimes when teaching Haskell I talk about this concept and assume everyone already has heard it, but I realize that it‚Äôs something universal yet easy to miss depending on how you‚Äôre learning it. So, here it is: how I understand the Functor and other related abstractions and free constructions in Haskell. The crux is this: instead of thinking about what fmap changes, ask: what does fmap keep constant? This isn‚Äôt a rigorous understanding and isn‚Äôt going to explain every aspect about every Functor, and will probably only be useful if you already know a little bit about Functors in Haskell. But it‚Äôs a nice intuition trick that has yet to majorly mislead me.",
