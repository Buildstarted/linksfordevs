    "Description": "The Algolia-powered Hacker News API returns nested comment threads that look like this: https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/27941108\n\n(For this story: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27941108)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": 27941108,\n    \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T14:15:05.000Z\",\n    \"type\": \"story\",\n    \"author\": \"edward\",\n    \"title\": \"Fun with Unix domain sockets\",\n    \"url\": \"https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/13/unix-domain-sockets/\",\n    \"children\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": 27942287,\n            \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T16:31:18.000Z\",\n            \"type\": \"comment\",\n            \"author\": \"DesiLurker\",\n            \"text\": \"<p>one lesser known...\",\n            \"children\": []\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": 27944615,\n            \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T21:26:33.000Z\",\n            \"type\": \"comment\",\n            \"author\": \"galaxyLogic\",\n            \"text\": \"<p>I read this from Wikipedia...\",\n            \"children\": [\n                {\n                    \"id\": 27944746,\n                    \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T21:49:07.000Z\",\n                    \"type\": \"comment\",\n                    \"author\": \"hughrr\",\n                    \"text\": \"<p>Yes although I ...\",\n                    \"children\": []\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\nI wanted to flatten this into an array of items so I could send it to `sqlite-utils insert`. This recipe worked:\n\n```\ncurl 'https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/27941108' \n  | jq '[recurse(.children[]) | del(.children)]' \n  | sqlite-utils insert hn.db items - --pk id\n```\nThe `jq` recipe here is:\n\n```jq\n[recurse(.children[]) | del(.children)]\n```\n\nThe first `recurse(.children[])` recurses through a list of everything in a `.children` array.\n\nThe `| del(.children)` then deletes that array from the returned objects.\n\nWrapping it all in `[ ]` ensures the overall result will be an array.\n\nApplied against the above example, this returns:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": 27941108,\n        \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T14:15:05.000Z\",\n        \"type\": \"story\",\n        \"author\": \"edward\",\n        \"title\": \"Fun with Unix domain sockets\",\n        \"url\": \"https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jul/13/unix-domain-sockets/\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 27942287,\n        \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T16:31:18.000Z\",\n        \"type\": \"comment\",\n        \"author\": \"DesiLurker\",\n        \"text\": \"<p>one lesser known...\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 27944615,\n        \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T21:26:33.000Z\",\n        \"type\": \"comment\",\n        \"author\": \"galaxyLogic\",\n        \"text\": \"<p>I read this from Wikipedia...\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 27944746,\n        \"created_at\": \"2021-07-24T21:49:07.000Z\",\n        \"type\": \"comment\",\n        \"author\": \"hughrr\",\n        \"text\": \"<p>Yes although I ...\"\n    }\n]\n```"
