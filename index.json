    "Description": "This paper is the paper to read about Raft consensus algorithm and a good way to build intuition for consensus algorithms in general. The “consensus” about consensus algorithms is that they are hard to understand / build / test, and not surprisingly having an understandable consensus algorithm has a lot of value for system builders. I think Raft is designed for today’s mainstream single leader multi-follower log-replicated state machine model so it is a great starting point for building a practical distributed system around it. I’ve read about raft before but this is the first time I went through the paper in full. I must admit I find Paxos not intuitive and hard to follow as well and I might give Paxos/Multi-Paxos a go some other time. Meanwhile Raft is something I can get behind and feel comfortable with. And that is saying something."
