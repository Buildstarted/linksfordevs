    "Description": "Ever wondered what it takes to build a complex cross-platform, open-source framework in .NET? In this session, we’ll walk through the complex engineering challenges and innovative solutions that power Uno Platform as a robust, single-codebase framework. Discover how we leverage advanced .NET techniques—such as Source Generators, how we built a custom MSBuild SDK called Uno.Sdk including the support for custom target framework identifiers, how we run a sophisticated, multi-stage CI pipeline in Azure DevOps with thousands of tests on all possible platforms and make sure we avoid making unintended breaking changes, and we will even explore the strategies used to port C++ code to C#.\n\nWith Martin Zikmund.\n\nBecome a channel member to enjoy benefits and access more content.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnuLHRlK_zhrpaTWvNOdMA/join",

    "Description": "Unlock the power of API performance testing with K6! This comprehensive tutorial covers everything you need to know about setting up K6 and writing various types of load tests in JavaScript. Learn how to create load tests, soak tests, spike tests, and stress tests to thoroughly evaluate your API's performance under different scenarios.\n\nStep-by-step guide to installing and configuring K6 on your system. We'll walk you through the process of getting K6 up and running, ensuring you're ready to start testing in no time. Writing Load Tests in JavaScript\nLearn how to craft effective load tests using JavaScript. We'll cover the K6 API, best practices for structuring your test scripts, and how to simulate realistic user behavior. Mastering Different Test Types:\n\n• Load Tests: Discover how to create tests that simulate expected load on your API.\n• Soak Tests: Learn to write long-duration tests to uncover memory leaks and performance degradation over time.\n• Spike Tests: Understand how to simulate sudden, intense bursts of traffic to your API.\n• Stress Tests: Explore techniques to push your API to its limits and beyond. \n\nDive into advanced features like custom metrics, thresholds, and scenarios. I will show you how to tailor your tests for specific API endpoints and requirements. Analyzing and Interpreting Results\nLearn how to read K6 test reports, identify performance bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your API. Perfect for developers and QA engineers looking to ensure their APIs can handle real-world traffic and scenarios. Boost your performance testing skills and take your API reliability to the next level with K6! \n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/remigiusz-zalewski/\nSource code: https://github.com/RemigiuszZalewski/YoutubeVideos/tree/main/Decorator\nDocs: https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/\n\n#apitesting #softwaretesting #coding #programming",
