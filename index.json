    "Timestamp": "2024-01-16T14:03:06",
    "Domain": "1a3orn.com",
    "Description": "<p>I've seen a few conversations where someone says something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've been using an open-source LLM lately -- I'm a huge fan of not depending on OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. But I'm really sad that the AI safety groups are trying to ban the kind of open-source LLM that I'm using.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone then responds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What! Almost no one <em>actually</em> wants to ban open source AI of the kind that you're using! That's just a recklessly-spread myth! AI Safety orgs just want to ban a tiny handful of future models -- no one has tried to pass laws that would have banned current open-sourced models!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This second claim is false.</p>\n<p>Many AI \"safety\" organizations or people have in the past advocated bans that would have criminalized the open-sourcing of models <em>currently extant</em> as of now, January 2024. Even more organizations have pushed for bans that would cap open source AI capabilities at more or less exactly their current limits.</p>\n<p>(I use open-sourcing broadly to refer to making weights generally available, not always to specific open-source compliant licensing.)</p>\n<p>At least a handful of the organizations that have pushed for such bans are well-funded and becoming increasingly well-connected to policy makers.</p>\n<p>Note that I think it's <em>entirely understandable</em> that someone would not realize such bans have been the goal of some AI safety orgs!</p>\n<p>For comprehensible reasons -- i.e., how many people judge such policies to be a horrible idea, including many people interested in AI safety -- such AI safety organizations have often directed the documents explaining their proposed policies to bureaucrats, legislative staffers, and so on, and not been proactive in communicating their goals to the public.</p>\n<p>Note also that <strong>not all</strong> AI safety organizations or AI-safety concerned people are trying to do this -- although, to be honest, a disturbing number are.</p>\n<p>At least a handful of people in some organizations believe -- as do I -- that open source has been increasingly <a href=\"https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/\">vital for AI safety work</a>. Given how <em>past</em> ban proposals would have been harmful, I think many future such proposals are therefore likely to be harmful as well, especially given that the arguments for them look pretty much identical.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, a partial list:</p>\n<h2><strong>1: Center for AI Safety</strong></h2>\n<p>The Center for AI Safety is a well-funded (i.e., with > <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?organization-name=center-for-ai-safety\">9 million USD</a>) 501c3 that focuses mostly on AI safety research and on outreach. You've probably heard of them because they gathered signatures for their <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\">sentence</a> about AI safety.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, they are also involved in policy. In response to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) request for comment they <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/comment/NTIA-2023-0005-1416\">sent</a> proposed regulatory rules to them.</p>\n<p>These rules propose defining \"powerful AI systems\" as any systems that meet or exceed certain measures for any of the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Computational resources used to train the system</strong> (e.g., 10^23 floating-point operations or ‚Äútraining FLOP‚Äù; this is approximately the amount of FLOP required to train GPT-3. Note that this threshold would be updated over time in order to account for algorithmic improvements.) [Note from 1a3orn; this means updated downwards]</p>\n<p><strong>Large parameter count</strong> (e.g., 80B parameters)</p>\n<p><strong>Benchmark performance</strong> (e.g., > 70% performance on the Multi-task Language Understanding benchmark (MMLU))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Systems meeting any of these requirements, according to the proposal, are subject to a number of requirements that would effectively ban open-sourcing them.</p>\n<p>Llama 2 was trained with > 10^23 FLOPs, and thus would have been banned beneath this rule. Fine-tunes of Llama 2 also obtain <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/159l9ll/llama270bguanacoqlora_becomes_the_first_model_on/\">greater than 70%</a>on the MMLU and thus <em>also</em> would have been banned beneath this rule.</p>\n<p>Note that -- despite how this would have prevented the release of Llama 2, and thus thousands of fine-tunes, and enormous quantities of <a href=\"https://www.beren.io/2023-11-05-Open-source-AI-has-been-vital-for-alignment/\">safety research</a> -- the document boasts that its proposals \"only regulate a small fraction of the overall AI development ecosystem.\"</p>\n<h2><strong>2: Center for AI Policy</strong></h2>\n<p>The Center for AI Policy -- different from the Center for AI Safety! -- is a DC-based lobbying organization. The announcement they <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/unwRBRQivd2LYRfuP/introducing-the-center-for-ai-policy-and-we-re-hiring\">made</a> about their existence made some waves -- because the rules that they initially proposed would have required the <em>already-released</em> Llama-2 to be regulated by a new agency.</p>\n<p>However, in a recent interview they <a href=\"https://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2023/12/202-the-center-for-ai-policy-talks-government-regulation/\">say</a> that they're \"trying to use the lightest touch we can -- we're trying to use a scalpel.\" Does this mean that they have changed their views?</p>\n<p>Well, they haven't made any legislation they're proposing visible yet. But in the same interview they say that models trained with more than 3x10^24 FLOPs or getting > 85 on the MMLU would be in their \"high risk\" category, which according to the interview explicitly means they would be banned from being open sourced.</p>\n<p>This would have outlawed the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon-180b\">Falcon 180b</a> by its FLOP measure, although -- to be fair -- the Falcon 180b was open-sourced by an organization in the United Arab Emirates, so it's not certain that it would matter.</p>\n<p>As far as the MMLU measure, no open source model at this level has <em>yet</em> been released, but GPT-4 scores ~90% on the MMLU. Thus, this amounts to a law attempting to permanently crimp open source models beneath GPT-4 levels, an event I otherwise think is reasonably likely in 2024.</p>\n<p>(I do not understand why AI safety orgs think that MMLU scores are a good way to measure danger.)</p>\n<h2><strong>3: Palisade Research</strong></h2>\n<p>This non-profit, headed by Jeffrey Ladish, has as its stated goal to \"create concrete demonstrations of dangerous capabilities to advise policy makers and the public on AI risks.\" That is, they try to make LLMs do dangerous or scary things so politicians will do particular things for them.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Ladish himself literally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1654319741501333504\">called for government to stop the release of Llama 2, saying \"we can prevent the release of a LLaMA 2! We need government action on this asap.\"</a></p>\n<p>(He also said that he thought it would potentially cause millions of dollars of damage, and was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffLadish/status/1666653302355009537\">more likely</a> to cause <strong>more</strong> than a billion dollars of damage than to cause less than a million.)</p>\n<h2><strong>4. The Future Society</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/\">The Future Society</a> is a think tank whose <a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/\">goal</a> is to \"align artificial intelligence through better governance.\" They boast 60 partners such as UNESCO and the Future of Life Institute, and claim to have spoke to over 8,000 \"senior decision makers\" and taught 4,000 students. They aim to provide guidance to both the EU and the US.</p>\n<p>In one of their premier policy documents, <a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/heavy-is-the-head-that-wears-the-crown.pdf\">\"Heavy is the head that wears the crown\"</a>, they define \"Type 2\" General Purpose AI (GPAI) as a kind trained with > 10^23 FLOPs (but less than 10^26) or scoring > 68% (but less than 88%) on the MMLU. Llama-2, again, falls into this category on both counts.</p>\n<p>The document mandates that anyone creating a Type 2 GPAI must -- well, must do many things -- but must provide for \"Absolute Trustworthiness,\" which seems to mean that the model must be incapable of doing anything bad whatsoever, and more to the point means that the provider of the model must be able to \"retract already deployed models (roll-back &#x26; shutdowns).\" Open source models would be unable to meet this requirement, obviously.</p>\n<p>Similarly, they say that providers would be \"required to <strong>continuously monitor the model‚Äôs capabilities and behaviour</strong>, detecting any anomalies and escalating cases of concern to relevant decision makers,\" which is again impossible to do with an open source model.</p>\n<p>Note that in accord with their policy recommendations, this group specifically calls out Meta's actions, dubbing the open-sourcing of Llama a \"particularly egregious case of misuse.\" They also seem to believe that Apache licensing is unacceptable, explicitly calling the \"no guarantee of fitness of purpose\" clause in such a license \"abusive.\"</p>\n<p>Don't worry, though! The Future Society says that they <a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/about-us/\">believe</a> that \"legitimate and sustainable governance requires bringing to the table many different perspectives.\"</p>\n<p>(My guess is that this is one of the major teams responsible trying to get the EU's rules to ban open source AI, but the institutional process by which the EU works is completely opaque to me and so I am only left guessing.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Note that the above is just a partial list of organizations or people who have made their policies or goals extremely explicit.</p>\n<p>There are other organizations or people out there whose policies are less legible, but ultimately are equally opposed to open sourcing. Consider, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.safer-ai.org/\">SaferAI</a> , whose CEO says he's fine <a href=\"https://x.com/Simeon_Cps/status/1710062142559285560?s=20\">\"with developing and deploying open source up to somewhere around Llama-1\"</a>; or the <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/proposal\">PauseAI</a> people, who think we should need approvals for training runs <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/proposal\">\"above a certain size (e.g. 1 billion parameters)\"</a> and who accused <a href=\"https://metaprotest.org/\">Meta of reckless irresponsibility</a> for releasing Llama-2.</p>\n<p>Or there is the extremely questionable <a href=\"https://www.stop.ai/proposals\">StopAI</a> group advised by Conjecture, which wishes to eliminate not merely all open source but all AI trained with > 10^23 FLOPs.</p>\n<p>Or there are surprisingly numerous people who want to completely change liability law, so that you cannot open-source a model without becoming liable for damage that it causes.</p>\n<p>These and similar statements from them either outright imply or would be <em>hard to separate</em> from policies that would have effectively banned currently-extant open-source.</p>\n<p>So, again -- it's <strong>just false</strong> to say that if AI safety groups haven't tried to ban models that already exist. They <em>already</em> would have banned models that are actively being used, if they had had their way in the past. They would have substantially contributed to a corporate monopoly on LLMs.</p>\n<p>If you are like me, and think the proposed policies mentioned above are pretty bad -- the stupidity of a law in no way prevents it from being passed! The above groups have not dissolved in the last 6 months. They still hope to pass something like these measures. They are still operating on the same questionable epistemology.</p>\n<p>The open-source AI movement is in general is <em>far behind</em> these groups and needs to get its legislative act together if the better organized \"anti-open source\" movement is not to obliterate it.</p>\n<p>And I think it is better to call it the \"anti-open source\" movement than the AI safety movement.</p>\n<p>The \"environmentalist\" movement helped get nuclear power plants effectively banned, thereby crippling a safe and low-carbon source of energy, causing immense harm to the environment and to humanity by doing so. They thought they were helping the environment. They were not.</p>\n<p>I think that some sectors of the \"AI safety\" movement are likely on their way to doing a similar thing, by preventing human use of, and research into, an easily-steerable and deeply non-rebellious form of intelligence.</p>",

    "Description": "Why is everyone in such a rush?\n\nWalk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java\nin 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C,\nSQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours.  \nThe Amazon advanced search for [title: teach,\nyourself, hours, since: 2000 and found 512 such books. Of the top ten, nine are programming books (the other is about bookkeeping). Similar results come from replacing \"teach yourself\" with \"learn\" or \"hours\" with \"days.\"\n \n\nThe conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn\nabout programming, or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to\nlearn than anything else.  \nFelleisen et al.\ngive a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say\n\"Bad programming is easy. Idiots can learn it in 21 days,\neven if they are dummies.\" The Abtruse Goose comic also had their take.\n\nLet's analyze what a title like Teach Yourself C++ in 24 Hours\ncould mean:\n\n\nTeach Yourself: In 24 hours you won't have time to write several\nsignificant programs, and learn from your successes and failures with\nthem.  You won't have time to work with an experienced programmer and\nunderstand what it is like to live in a C++ environment.  In short, you\nwon't have time to learn much.  So the book can only be talking about a\nsuperficial familiarity, not a deep understanding. As Alexander Pope said,\na little learning is a dangerous thing.C++: In 24 hours you might be able to learn some of the syntax of\nC++ (if you already know another language), but you couldn't\nlearn much about how to use the language.  In short, if you were, say, a\nBasic programmer, you could learn to write programs in the style of\nBasic using C++ syntax, but you couldn't learn what C++ is\nactually good (and bad) for.  So what's the point?  Alan\nPerlis once said: \"A language that doesn't affect the way you\nthink about programming, is not worth knowing\".  One possible point is\nthat you have to learn a tiny bit of C++ (or more likely, something\nlike JavaScript or Processing) because you need to interface with an\nexisting tool to accomplish a specific task. But then you're not\nlearning how to program; you're learning to accomplish that task.in 24 Hours: Unfortunately, this is not enough, as the next\nsection shows.\n\n\nTeach Yourself Programming in Ten Years\n\nResearchers (Bloom\n(1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes\n(1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it\ntakes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of\nareas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph\noperation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in\nneuropsychology and topology.  The key is deliberative\npractice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself\nwith a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it,\nanalyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting\nany mistakes.  Then repeat.  And repeat again.  There appear to be no\nreal shortcuts: even Mozart, who was a musical prodigy at age 4, took\n13 more years before he began to produce world-class music.  In\nanother genre, the Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a\nstring of #1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964.\nBut they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since\n1957, and while they had mass appeal early on, their first great\ncritical success, Sgt. Peppers, was released in 1967. \n\nMalcolm\nGladwell has popularized the idea, although he concentrates on 10,000 hours, not 10 years.\nHenri Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004) had another metric: \"Your first 10,000 photographs are your  worst.\" (He didn't\nanticipate that with digital cameras, some people can reach that mark in a week.)\nTrue expertise may take a lifetime:\nSamuel Johnson (1709-1784) said \"Excellence in any department can be\nattained only by the labor of a lifetime; it is not to be purchased at\na lesser price.\"  And Chaucer (1340-1400) complained \"the lyf so short, the craft\nso long to lerne.\" Hippocrates (c. 400BC) is known for the excerpt \"ars longa,\nvita brevis\", which is part of the longer quotation \"Ars longa, vita\nbrevis, occasio praeceps, experimentum periculosum, iudicium\ndifficile\", which in English renders as \"Life is short, [the] craft\nlong, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment\ndifficult.\"  \n\nOf course, no single number can be the final answer: it doesn't seem reasonable\nto assume that all skills (e.g., programming, chess playing, checkers playing, and music playing)\ncould all require exactly the same amount of time to master, nor that all people\nwill take exactly the same amount of time. As \nProf. \nK. Anders Ericsson puts it, \"In most domains it's remarkable how much time even the most\ntalented individuals need in order to reach the highest levels of performance. The 10,000 hour number just gives you a sense that we're talking years of 10 to 20 hours a week which those who some people would argue are the most innately talented individuals still need to get to the highest level.\"\n\nSo You Want to be a Programmer\n\nHere's my recipe for programming success:\n\n\n Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun.  Make sure\nthat it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in your ten years/10,000 hours. Program.  The best kind of learning is learning\nby doing.  To put it more technically, \"the maximal level of\nperformance for individuals in a given domain is not attained\nautomatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of\nperformance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as\na result of deliberate efforts to improve.\" (p. 366)\nand \"the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an\nappropriate difficulty level for the particular individual,\ninformative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections\nof errors.\" (p. 20-21)  The book \nCognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday\nLife is an interesting \nreference for this viewpoint. Talk with other programmers; read other programs.  This is more important\nthan any book or training course. If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a\ngraduate school).  This will give you access to some jobs that require\ncredentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field,\nbut if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get\nsimilar experience on your own or on the job. In any case, book learning alone won't\nbe enough. \"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert\nprogrammer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make\nsomebody an expert painter\" says Eric Raymond, author of The New\nHacker's Dictionary. One of the best programmers I ever hired had\nonly a High School degree; he's produced a lot of great software, has his own news group, and made enough in stock options to buy his own nightclub. Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer\non some projects; be the worst on some others.  When you're the best,\nyou get to test your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire\nothers with your vision.  When you're the worst, you learn what the\nmasters do, and you learn what they don't like to do (because they\nmake you do it for them). Work on projects after other programmers. \nUnderstand a program written by someone else. See what it takes to\nunderstand and fix it when the original programmers are not\naround. Think about how to design your programs to make it easier for\nthose who will maintain them after you. Learn at least a half dozen programming languages.  Include one\nlanguage that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that\nemphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one\nthat supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one\nthat supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++\ntemplates), and\none that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).   Remember that there is a \"computer\" in \"computer science\". Know\nhow long it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a\nword from memory (with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek to a new location on disk. (Answers here.)  Get involved in a language\nstandardization effort.  It could be the ANSI C++ committee, or it\ncould be deciding if your local coding style will have 2 or 4 space\nindentation levels.  Either way, you learn about what other people\nlike in a language, how deeply they feel so, and perhaps even a little\nabout why they feel so. Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as\nquickly as possible.\n\n\nWith all that in mind, its questionable how far you can get just by\nbook learning.  Before my first child was born, I read all the How\nTo books, and still felt like a clueless novice.  30 Months later,\nwhen my second child was due, did I go back to the books for a\nrefresher? No.  Instead, I relied on my personal experience, which\nturned out to be far more useful  and reassuring\nto me than the thousands of pages written\nby experts.\n\nFred Brooks, in his essay No Silver Bullet \nidentified a three-part plan for finding great\nsoftware designers:\n\n\n   Systematically identify top designers as early as possible.Assign a career mentor to be responsible for the development of the prospect and carefully keep a career file.Provide opportunities for growing designers to interact and stimulate each other.\n\nThis assumes that some people already have the qualities necessary for\nbeing a great designer; the job is to properly coax them along.  Alan\nPerlis put it more succinctly: \"Everyone can be taught to sculpt:\nMichelangelo would have had to be taught how not to. So it is with the\ngreat programmers\".  Perlis is saying that the greats have some\ninternal quality that transcends their training.  But where does the\nquality come from?  Is it innate?  Or do they develop it through\ndiligence?  As Auguste Gusteau (the fictional chef in\nRatatouille) puts it, \"anyone can cook, but only the fearless\ncan be great.\"  I think of it more as willingness to devote a large\nportion of one's life to deliberative practice.  But maybe\nfearless is a way to summarize that. Or, as Gusteau's critic,\nAnton Ego, says: \"Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great\nartist can come from anywhere.\"\n\n\nSo go ahead and buy that Java/Ruby/Javascript/PHP book; you'll\nprobably get some use out of it.  But you won't change your life, or\nyour real overall expertise as a programmer in 24 hours or 21 days.  \nHow about working hard to continually improve over 24 months?\nWell, now you're starting to get somewhere...\n\nReferences\n\n\nBloom, Benjamin (ed.)

When asked \"what operating system should\nI use, Windows, Unix, or Mac?\", my answer is usually: \"use whatever\nyour friends use.\"  The advantage you get from learning from your\nfriends will offset any intrinsic difference between OS, or\nbetween programming languages.  Also consider your future friends:\nthe community of programmers that you will be a part of if you\ncontinue.  Does your chosen language have a large growing community\nor a small dying one?  Are there books, web sites, and online forums\nto get answers from?  Do you like the people in those forums?\n\nKeep it simple.  Programming languages such as C++\nand Java are designed for professional development by large teams of\nexperienced programmers who are concerned about the run-time efficiency of\ntheir code.\nAs a result, these languages have complicated parts designed for these circumstances.\nYou're concerned with learning to program.  You don't need that complication.\nYou want a language that was designed to be easy to learn and remember by a\nsingle new programmer.\n\nPlay. Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the\nnormal, interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key,\nor \"batch\" mode, in which you only hear the notes after you finish a whole song?\nClearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for the piano, and also for \nprogramming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it.\n\n\n\nGiven these criteria, my recommendations for a first programming\nlanguage would be Python or\nScheme.  \nAnother choice is Javascript, not because it is perfectly well-designed for beginners,\nbut because there are so many online tutorials for it, such as \nKhan Academy's tutorial.\nBut your\ncircumstances may vary, and there are other good choices. If your\nage is a single-digit, you might prefer\nAlice or Squeak \nor Blockly (older learners might also enjoy these). The important\nthing is that you choose and get started.\n\n\n\nAppendix: Books and Other Resources\n\n\nSeveral people have asked what books and web pages they should learn\nfrom.  I repeat that \"book learning alone won't be enough\" but I can\nrecommend the following:\n\n\n Scheme: Structure and\nInterpretation of Computer Programs (Abelson & Sussman) is\nprobably the best introduction to computer science, and it does\nteach programming as a way of understanding the computer science. \nYou can see online videos of lectures on this book, as well as the complete text online. The book is\nchallenging and will weed out some people who perhaps could be\nsuccessful with another approach.  \n\n Scheme:\nHow to\nDesign Programs (Felleisen et al.) is one of the best books\non how to actually design programs in an elegant and functional way.\n\n Python: \nPython Programming:\nAn Intro to CS (Zelle) is a good introduction using Python.  \n\n Python: Several\nonline tutorials\n are available at Python.org.\n\n Oz: Concepts,\nTechniques, and Models of Computer Programming (Van Roy & Haridi)\nis seen by some as the modern-day successor to Abelson & Sussman.\nIt is a tour through the big ideas of programming, covering a wider\nrange than Abelson & Sussman while being perhaps easier to read and\nfollow.  It uses a language, Oz, that is not widely known but serves as\na basis for learning other languages.\n\n<\n\n\n\nNotes\nT. Capey points out that the Complete\n  Problem Solver page on Amazon now has the \"Teach Yourself\n  Bengali in 21 days\" and \"Teach Yourself Grammar and Style\" books under the\n  \"Customers who shopped for this item also shopped for these items\"\n  section.
