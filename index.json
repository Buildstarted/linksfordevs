These models leverage larger context windows and pretraining on web-scale data.\nThis post reviews the papers of the following models:",

This is nothing new, level designers have been doing this for a long time in game development. They build the levels, and programming provides the tools and support but never get in the middle. This changes the relationship between departments completely from confrontational to collaborative.
