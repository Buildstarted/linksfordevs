This could be for organizational reasons and distributing the work across a team. Or it could be because of scaling issues and performance bottlenecks. You begin the process of evaluating the benefits and tradeoffs of possible solutions. At last, you come to a decision. It's time to migrate parts of the system to individual services. So, how do we approach this migration from monolith to microservices?",
