That is what they treat, particularly as that is often their specialisation.  A knee surgeon will look at the problematic joint because that is where the patient reports the symptom.  That makes sense, right? Doesn’t it? What does this have to do with the broader work and life sphere? What if this is the wrong approach?",

Depending on your perspective, I-bonds are either free money or the only true money storage. They're zero-risk bonds with an interest rate that always matches or exceeds inflation. The interest rate trails inflation a bit and changes at 6 month intervals, so the math works out such that if you buy before May this year, you get a guaranteed ~8.5% return over the next 12 months, but if you miss this month you might get screwed. After a year you're allowed to withdraw, with almost negligible penalties. But the government only lets each person buy $10,000 of I-bonds a year. Still, that's a free $850.",
