The act is too broad, and it doesn&#39;t matter that there&#39;s never been an instance of any of the proclaimed things that this act protects adults, children and vulnerable people from... the very broad language and the fact that I&#39;m based in the UK means we&#39;re covered.\n\nThe act simply does not care that this site and platform is run by an individual, and that I do so philanthropically without any profit motive (typically losing money), nor that the site exists to reduce social loneliness, reduce suicide rates, help build meaningful communities that enrich life.\n\nThe act only cares that is it &#34;linked to the UK&#34; (by me being involved as a UK native and resident, by you being a UK based user), and that users can talk to other users... that&#39;s it, that&#39;s the scope.\n\nI can&#39;t afford what is likely tens of thousand to go through all the legal hoops here over a prolonged period of time, the site itself barely gets a few hundred in donations each month and costs a little more to run... this is not a venture that can afford compliance costs... and if we did, what remains is a disproportionately high personal liability for me, and one that could easily be weaponised by disgruntled people who are banned for their egregious behaviour (in the years running fora I&#39;ve been signed up to porn sites, stalked IRL and online, subject to death threats, had fake copyright takedown notices, an attempt to delete the domain name with ICANN... all from those whom I&#39;ve moderated to protect community members)... I do not see an alternative to shuttering it.\n\nThe conclusion I have to make is that we&#39;re done... Microcosm, LFGSS, the many other communities running on this platform... the risk to me personally is too high, and so I will need to shutter them all.\n\nWhat and When\n\nSo here&#39;s the statement...\n\nOn Sunday 16th March 2025 (the last day prior to the Act taking effect) I will delete the virtual servers hosting LFGSS and other communities, and effectively immediately end the approximately 300 small communities that I run, and the few large communities such as LFGSS.\n\nIt&#39;s been a good run, I&#39;ve administered internet forums since 1996 having first written my own in Perl to help fans of music bands to connect with each other, and I then contributed to PHP forum software like vBulletin, Vanilla, and phpBB, before finally writing a platform in Go that made it cost efficient enough to bring interest based communities to so many others, and expand the social good that comes from people being connected to people.\n\nApproximately 28 years and 9 months of providing almost 500 forums in total to what is likely a half a million people in that time frame... the impact that these forums have had on the lives of so many cannot be understated.\n\nThe peak of the forums has been the last 5 years, we&#39;ve plateaued around 275k monthly users across the almost 300 websites on multiple instances of the platform that is Microcosm, though LFGSS as a single community probably peaked in the 2013-2018 time period when it alone was hitting numbers in excess of 50k monthly users.\n\nThe forums have delivered marriages, births, support for those who have passed (cancer being the biggest reason), people reunited with stolen bikes, travel support, work support, so much joy and happiness and memorable experiences... but it&#39;s also been directly cited by many as being the reason that they are here today, the reason they didn&#39;t commit suicide or self-harm. It&#39;s help people get through awful relationship breakups, and helped people overcome incredible challenges with their health.\n\nIt&#39;s devastating to just... turn it off... but this is what the Act forces a sole individual running so many social websites for a public good to do.\n\nI don&#39;t know where to recommend... I know lots of people have moved small groups to places like Signal and WhatsApp, and that some people are on the fediverse, and some are in other websites and groups.\n\nThere is no central place that could take us all and preserve the very special thing we had... so it&#39;s done.\n\nThis is a really special place... the people are special... I guess the next 3 months will be a time of sharing what it meant, and of groups figuring out where they want to go next.\n\nLove you all forever, it&#39;s been amazing to be a part of it all, I never thought I&#39;d touch the lives of so many people by running websites, and in turn to give so much reason to my own life. In the end, the person I save most was likely myself.\n\nDee",
