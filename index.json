While not everything has landed yet, two very important changes to Android did arrive, one of which has been in the works for a couple years!\nWe're talking about a large scale rewrite to Dolphin's Android Input Handling that will eventually allow it to match the feature set users on Desktop Dolphin builds enjoy. Android users also get another major quality of life upgrade - Dolphin now is now a Document Provider on Android. This means you can use Dolphin to directly copy files into and out of its per-app directory on the latest versions of Android.\nIn this report, we'll be going through both of these and several other important changes. Enjoy!",

However, after experiencing the strictness of the Rust type system, and noticing all the problems that it prevents ‚Äúby construction‚Äù, I suddenly became quite anxious whenever I got back to Python and wasn‚Äôt provided with the same guarantees.",
