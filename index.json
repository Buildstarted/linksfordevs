    "Description": "Imagine youâ€™re a detective working on a big case. Youâ€™ve got a pile of clues (queries), but theyâ€™re all mixed together with no labels. Which one belongs to which part of the case? Frustrating, right? Thatâ€™s what debugging EF Core queries feels like without Query Tags. But with Query Tags, it's like a breath of fresh air, relieving the frustration and making the process more manageable. Query Tags in EF Core are like sticky notes for your SQL. They allow you to label your queries, making it significantly easier to track down problems, optimize performance, and appear as a debugging wizard.",
