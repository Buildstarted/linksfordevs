OpenAI recently ran the OpenAI Codex Challenge, where competitors were tasked with solving various programming tasks, and could use Codex to help them. I participated in the challenge and got 75th place2. Due to some overloaded servers during the challenge, many people were unable to actually do actually compete, so that ranking is mostly due to me figuring out the best times to reload to get the challenge to work. After the challenge, OpenAI sent me an invite to try out the Codex model, which I used to do the testing in the post."
