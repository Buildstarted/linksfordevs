    "Description": "Implementations that do not match design specs. Behavior redesigns that misalign with architecture. Friction between designer and programmers. General frustration in both sides. Designer first UI development purpose is to minimize those situations or eliminating them completely. In essence it based around letting designers build the UI themselves, so there is nothing between their vision and execution. Programmers provide tools and support but never build the actual layouts. This is nothing new, level designers have been doing this for a long time in game development. They build the levels, and programming provides the tools and support but never get in the middle. This changes the relationship between departments completely from confrontational to collaborative. Since programming responsibility is to empower and support the designers.\n\nBecome a channel member to enjoy benefits and access more content.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnuLHRlK_zhrpaTWvNOdMA/join",
