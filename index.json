    "Description": "Eight years ago I spoke at a TEDx conference where I vented my frustration at the app and app store model. I specifically called out that Apps are to me the biggest step back in software and content distribution we could do. Instead of an on-demand platform like the web where we could get the weather by typing “weather berlin” or even talk to our phone, we got asked to download, install and most likely sign up for an app instead. It doesn’t scale, it puts the publisher before the user and it isn’t technically necessary with the web platform having evolved immensely in the last years.",
