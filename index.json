    "Description": "Emacs Lisp (Elisp) is the Lisp dialect used by the Emacs text editor family.\nGNU Emacs can currently execute Elisp code either interpreted or\nbyte-interpreted after it has been compiled to byte-code. In this work we\ndiscuss the implementation of an optimizing compiler approach for Elisp\ntargeting native code. The native compiler employs the byte-compiler's internal\nrepresentation as input and exploits libgccjit to achieve code generation using\nthe GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) infrastructure. Generated executables are\nstored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the\nfunctionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several\noptimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs\ncore and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able\nto bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files,\nincluding the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA). Native-compiled\nElisp shows an increase of performance ranging from 2.3x up to 42x with respect\nto the equivalent byte-code, measured over a set of small benchmarks."

    "Description": "Product-oriented teams are triumphantly declaring, “Sales and marketing had their time. The future is product-led growth.” In other words: if you build it, users will come. We at Greylock are longtime investors in product-led growth (PLG) companies such as Clockwise, Clubhouse, Coda, Demisto, Dropbox, Figma, Quip and Sqreen. I’ve recently invested in this trend of end-users becoming increasingly networked into communities, and therefore increasingly powerful. We understand the power of bottoms-up distribution. But we also continually see great product founders get caught flat-footed, underachieving against their growth goals when they rely solely on organic end-user adoption as their go-to-market (GTM) strategy, rather than as part of a whole-company system. Let’s look at the limits of PLG, a playbook for incorporating it into a more complete GTM strategy, and some of the unique challenges of getting this right."
