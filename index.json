Rooted in the Lisp ethos, the premise was that by understanding a handful of primitives and mastering a small set of combinators, students could build a platonic ladder of abstractions‚Äîa veritable cathedral of computation‚Äîand still reason about every brick. This pedagogical approach involved first creating abstractions to model the problem domain, effectively designing a custom language in which the final solution could then be expressed cleanly, almost self-evidently.",
