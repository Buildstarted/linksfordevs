    "Description": "On the first of april I started my first full-time month as the solo founder of Webindie. I’ll try to build a bootstrapped software-as-a-service product that should get me to ramen profitability in a year. Having previous experience running an agency was a huge help so far. Lots of entrepreneurial jobs such as doing taxes, requesting a business bank account, apply for a business credit card, and registering at the chamber of commerce were at least vaguely familiar to me. The development and hosting side of Webindie shouldn’t be a problem either, as at my previous position I’ve been developing and hosting Ruby on Rails web applications for 10+ years."
