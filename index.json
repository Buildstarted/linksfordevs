    "Description": "From my first desk job working at my college newspaper. My first job was working at a small deli and grocery store in Lake Tahoe when I was 15. It was a job that came full circle some twenty years later when my wife and I bought a place called ‚ÄãTracy‚Äôs Drive-In Grocery‚Äã in 2021, a little place that‚Äôs been in business since 1940. I‚Äôve had my fair share of gigs in between. I worked in fast food. I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company. I‚Äôve been a lifeguard. I dropped out of college to be a research assistant to an author. I worked a desk at a talent agency in Beverly Hills. I‚Äôve started multiple businesses. I‚Äôve freelanced. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to speak and consult with multi-billion dollar companies and Super Bowl winning sports franchises, family offices and law firms. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve done it all because that‚Äôs one thing you learn‚Äìhow much you have left to learn‚Äìbut I have done a lot. I‚Äôve had to think a lot about how to be a good employee as well as how to be a good boss. I‚Äôve seen what makes good companies succeed and bad companies fail. I‚Äôve seen how people get ahead‚Ä¶and how people get stuff. I‚Äôve also written a lot about this over the years, as I was figuring it out. In fact, many times I had to talk to bosses about this ‚Äúlittle thing I do on the side‚Äù which was writing until eventually, the business stuff itself because of the stuff I do on the side. And now I have to have the conversation the other way with the people who work for me at ‚ÄãDaily Stoic‚Äã or ‚ÄãBrass Check‚Äã or at ‚ÄãThe Painted Porch‚Äã or at ‚ÄãTracy‚Äôs‚Äã: Ok, but what do you really want to do and how can I help you get there? Anyway, this post is about that. The best of those lessons‚Äîthings I wish I‚Äôd been told when I was just starting and things I still tell myself. Some of them might be exactly what you need to hear right now. Some might not apply to you yet, or ever. That‚Äôs okay. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out, looking to make a big change, or aiming to reach new heights in your current role, I hope you‚Äôll find something here that helps you navigate your own unique path. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It‚Äôs not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity. I remember once I called Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, about some little success I‚Äôd had on some project. He was very busy and frustrated that I‚Äôd interrupted, but politely, he said, ‚ÄúRyan, you are calling me to tell me that you did your job.‚Äù I thought of that conversation when I saw that famous scene in Mad Men where Peggy complains that Don never says thank you. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the money is for!‚Äù he tells her. The thing that‚Äôs wrong about imposter syndrome is that for the most part no one is thinking about you at all. They‚Äôre too busy with their own doubts and their own work. When I was starting out as an assistant in Hollywood, someone told me that the best thing I could do was make my boss look good. Don‚Äôt worry about credit, they said. Forget credit so hard that you‚Äôre glad when other people get it instead of you. It ended up being pretty decent advice, but it was nowhere near the right wording. I think a better way to express it would be: ‚ÄãFind canvases for other people to paint on‚Äã. Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up and comers to introduce them to. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiency and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. Very rarely have I ever let anyone go because they did not have the skills to do their job. It‚Äôs almost always their unwillingness to learn those skills or their inability to take feedback. When I was 20 years old, I was working at this talent agency in Hollywood, and I got invited to this important meeting. As they were talking about stuff, I interjected and said something. My mentor took me aside after and he said, why did you say that? Did you think it actually needed to be said or did you just feel like you wanted to have something to say? I think about that all the time. It‚Äôs in ‚ÄãThe 48 Laws of Power‚Äã ‚Äî Always say less than necessary. Saying less than necessary, not interjecting at every chance we get‚Äîthis is actually the mark not just of a self-disciplined person, but also a very smart and wise person. The boss/mentor/biz can‚Äôt want you to succeed more than you want it. You have to be the driver of your own life/career/advancement. I was working full time at American Apparel but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about writing a book. Over lunch one day, Robert Greene told me, Ryan, while people wait for the right moment, ‚Äãthere are two types of time‚Äã: Dead time‚Äîwhere they are passive and biding and Alive time‚Äîwhere they are learning and acting and getting the most out of every second. Which will this be for you? When you‚Äôre lacking motivation, remind yourself: discipline now, freedom later. The labor will pass, and the rewards will last. When I first moved to Austin in 2013, I went out to lunch‚Äîfittingly‚Äîwith a writer named Austin Kleon. I was a longtime fan of his book ‚ÄãSteal Like an Artist‚Äã (his book ‚ÄãKeep Going‚Äã is another favorite). After we ate, [...]",
