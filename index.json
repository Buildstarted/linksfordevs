    "Description": "Native AOT has been part of .NET since .NET 7. With each release we're extending the areas where it can be used. From console apps in .NET 7, through ASP.NET web APIs in .NET 8, to MAUI in .NET 9. It is your best bet if you need your .NET app to start fast and use as little memory as possible.\n\nBut how does native AOT actually work? Why does it start so fast? How can we fit an entire .NET runtime, the base class libraries, and your code in a 1 MB executable file?\n\nIn this talk we'll peek into the internal workings of native AOT compilation and look at what it does at run time.\n\nFeaturing: Michal Strehovsk√Ω\n\nConnect with .NET: \nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\nüë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet #dotnetconf #dotnet9",
