    "Description": "For as long as media has existed, certain actors have always tried to manipulate it in order to win favor from the people (increased revenue, cultivating a good image of self, disavowing rivals, inter-alia). However, this practice has now become significantly pronounced due to the ubiquity of the Internet. Corporates, Business Rivals, Nation-States, and Criminal Organizations alike want to influence their target crowd in one way or another to achieve a diverse set of strategic objectives. And they absolutely do not hesitate to employ the means of Disinformation. Be it the denigration of Covid vaccines or promotion of a particular election candidate, we have seen the usage of Disinformation time and time again, and it is unlikely that this practice would stop without an effective intervention from the corresponding governments.",

    "Description": "Recently, Casey Muratori has implemented a proof-of-concept terminal,\nwhich is designed around fast input processing and rendering.  This is an important\nand commendable effort, since the vast majority of software performs tens to\nthousands of times slower than it can.[citation needed]\n\nOne of the design choices of refterm is to use a hash table to cache glyph rendering.\nThe key in this table is the UTF-8 string of a single glyph.  To avoid string\nallocations, the hash value of the glyph bytes is used as a key instead.\n\nWhen Casey got asked about the possibility of hash collisions on stream,\nhe responded with a claim that the hash function used in refterm is ‚Äúa strong hash‚Äù,\nand the complexity to find collision is about 2^64 operations.\nAfter analyzing the code for the hash function used in refterm, a few flaws\nwere found in the hash function, and O(1) attacks were discovered.\n\n",
