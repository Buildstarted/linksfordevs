It veers technical, because I suspect it will be of interest to other people running servers with UGC (i.e., every fedi instance), and also because the mechanics of how I figured out what I figured out might be useful.  It's also got information about how the FBI collects data, which is of interest to everyone, but especially US citizens.  I have a few pieces of the puzzle, maybe someone with interlocking pieces can say more; I'm happy to compare notes.",

It existed on only one of my Proxmox instances (I can't replicate between them because the original instance doesn't use zfs. oops) so if the virtual machine or physical machine was unreachable for whatever reason, it effectively blocked my access to any service in my homelab Kubernetes cluster, and also broke communication between nodes and the Kubernetes API. It didn't happen often, and the fix was often trivial, but it still bothered me. Coupled with the fact that until recently the Kubernetes cluster also acted as a reverse proxy to services hosted on Proxmox and my NAS (read more about that stuff here), it could cause a wider outage than just what's on the cluster.",
