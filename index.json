Hell yeah, that’s useful1! But most of the things that are taught in a typical (AP, A-level, IB) high-school stats course are not only of little practical value, but also—and more importantly—misleading. Statistics is one of very few subjects where studying it for a short time leads to poorer intuition about the real world than not having studied it at all."

Now we have the answer.\n\nApple's M1 hardware is incredibly powerful and excels at running Dolphin. This announcement has been in the works for some time, eagle eyed users may have noticed that earlier this month macOS builds were now being designated as \"Intel\". That's because delroth and Skyler had set up a new buildbot using a service called MacStadium for creating Universal macOS binaries.
