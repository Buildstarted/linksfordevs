    "Description": "As I mentioned in the post about my backup system, I run restic check\nregularly, to test the integrity of my backup. It has never reported any error\nin my repository. It performs a quick, shallow check, and does not verify that\nall the data is intact. I also restore a random file, whenever I run restic check, to test recoverability.\nShortly after I wrote the previous post, I decided to run restic check --read-data for the first time ever. This reads every file in the repository\nand simulates a full restore. To my utter horror, it reported many errors like\nthese!\nPack ID does not match, want 5e66c2ac, got e80051de\npack d64be86d contains 1 errors: [Blob ID does not match, want 8ebf2c10, got 350f6ba1]",
