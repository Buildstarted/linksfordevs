Given the number of subtleties in the design, and pitfalls in the\nuse, of integer types it’s not surprising that most programmers are\nunaware of at least some of them. However, what is perhaps more surprising is that most\nprogramming language designers and implementers aren’t fully aware of\nsome of the subtleties and pitfalls either. That leads to languages and their\nimplementations baking in unintended, and sometimes unfortunate, design decisions.\nAt the end of conversations on this topic, I’ve sometimes said “this stuff\nis hard and someone should think more about this and write it up” but it’s an\nunsatisfying conclusion. So even though I don’t have all the answers – indeed, I’m\nfairly sure that I don’t know all the questions – I’m going to jot down my\ncurrent thinking on this subject.",

    "Timestamp": "2022-05-17T19:01:54",

    "Description": "Digital media defines modern childhood, but its cognitive effects are unclear and hotly debated. We believe that studies with genetic data could clarify causal claims and correct for the typically unaccounted role of genetic predispositions. Here, we estimated the impact of different types of screen time (watching, socializing, or gaming) on children’s intelligence while controlling for the confounding effects of genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic status. We analyzed 9855 children from the USA who were part of the ABCD dataset with measures of intelligence at baseline (ages 9–10) and after two years. At baseline, time watching (r = −&nbsp;0.12) and socializing (r = −&nbsp;0.10) were negatively correlated with intelligence, while gaming did not correlate. After two years, gaming positively impacted intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.17), but socializing had no effect. This is consistent with cognitive benefits documented in experimental studies on video gaming. Unexpectedly, watching videos also benefited intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.12), contrary to prior research on the effect of watching TV. Although, in a posthoc analysis, this was not significant if parental education (instead of SES) was controlled for. Broadly, our results are in line with research on the malleability of cognitive abilities from environmental factors, such as cognitive training and the Flynn effect.",
