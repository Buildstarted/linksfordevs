Looked interesting based on a cursory look, but being actually pretty satisfied with Git, and not having major problems with it, I haven’t checked it out.\nThat is, until last week, when I finally decided to give it a go! I dived into a couple blog posts for a few of hours, and surprisingly (noting that we’re talking about a VCS) I found myself enjoying it a lot, seeing the consistent design, and overall simplicity it managed to achieve.",

It’s inefficient, exhausting, and makes your app look like it’s stuck in the Stone Age. But with batching in EF Core, you can wave goodbye to this inefficiency. It's the magic trick that lets you update or insert multiple records in a single trip to the database, making you and your app more productive and efficient. Batching is all about doing more with less. It minimizes round trips to the database, saves resources, and makes your app faster. Understanding and implementing batching in EF Core is like gaining a superpower-it makes your app work smarter, not harder, and gives you a sense of control and confidence in your development process.",

I got very solid performance off the same baseline AMD EPYC Rome system that has been at the core of our entire journey  That initial parts selection has remained fantastic! Owners of that system are going to get some great news today also as they can hit between 4.25 to 3.5 TPS (tokens per second) on the Q4 671b full model. This is important as the distilled versions are simply not the same at all. They are vastly inferior and other models out perform them handily. Running the full model, with a 16K or greater context window, is indeed the pathway to the real experience and it is worthwhile. Since this runs decent enough on CPU alone it also can hang out while you run smaller models, like vision models, at the same time. To reiterate, this will not fully run in only GPU VRAM alone unless you have a massive rig. I will show you all the tips and tricks to get this working. It is not “easy” but if you like tech tinkering it is a lot of fun.",
