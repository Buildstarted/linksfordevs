    "Description": "Manifolds are still the ‘bread and butter’ of modern machine learning\nresearch. I discussed them in an earlier post,\naptly titled ‘What is a manifold?’. Here, I want to describe some\nnon-examples, i.e. spaces that are not manifolds. The main\nmotivation for this post is to dispel some false notions about\nmanifolds—the term has been so common in certain circles that it is\nalmost synonymous with ‘data.’ However, as I tried to explain in my\nprevious post, a manifold is a space that is exceptionally\nwell-behaved and, most importantly, homogeneous.1 To reiterate my favourite\ndefinition:2 a d-dimensional manifold M is a space that\nlocally looks like a d-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. like some\nRd. The important thing is that d must not vary;\nevery point in M needs to satisfy this definition for the\nsame value of d."
