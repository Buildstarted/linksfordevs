While I receive a small amount of funding from\nAntithesis and from my\nFreeBSD/EC2 Patreon, it\nrapidly became clear that my release engineering duties were competing\nwith — in fact, out-competing — FreeBSD/EC2 for my available\nFreeBSD volunteer hours: In addition to my long list of \"features to\nimplement\" stagnating, I had increasingly been saying \"huh that's weird...\noh well, no time to investigate that now\".  In short, by early 2024 I was\nbecoming increasingly concerned that I was not in a position to be a good\n\"owner\" of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform.",
