If you're like me and have never used Google Duplex, it's a feature of Google Assistant that could make calls on behalf of a person and automatically perform a task, such as booking restaurant tables. While you may have never heard of Google Duplex there's a good chance you've used a generative AI tool like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or GitHub Copilot. Authenticity Weâ€™re going to need a way to prove the authenticity of a piece of digital content, everywhere, in a simple manner. This is where public key cryptography comes in. Our current solutions are noble efforts, but remain too complex. It's quite an understatement to say that AI has come a long way since 2018, and yet the blog post's core thesis is even stronger today than when it was written. At the time I was concerned about a future where deepfakes, audio manipulation, and text generation spread across the internet. We're now living in the beginning of that future, this is our present. It has never been faster or easier to generate inorganic content, the tools to do so are more usable and accessible than ever. AI already has us questioning what we see on the internet, and the problem isn't going away.

    "Description": "ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs allow you to quickly create controller-less HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. A minimal API typically has an endpoint URL and an endpoint handler. At times you want to intercept an endpoint handler so that you can add pre and post processing to the endpoint handler. That's where Endpoint Filters come into picture. When there are too many endpoints, it makes sense to group them using a common URL prefix. This is taken care by Route Groups. In this article we will examine both with a few examples.",
