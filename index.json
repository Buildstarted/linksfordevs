    "Description": "After finishing up the macOS M1 article the blog staff took a little break. Then they saw the date.\n\nUpon looking at the actual changelog, however, something became readily apparent: this wasn't going to be just a progress report; this was going to be a MEGA Progress Report. The long rumored time era of developers merging everything at once had finally come to pass. We have graphical fixes for Super Mario Galaxy and Luigi's Mansion, crash fixes for Star Wars: Rogue Squadron III, Xenoblade Chronicles, Ultimate Spider-Man, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (AArch64), and new features that make playing games more pleasant! And about AArch64, there are a litany of optimizations and fixes that will change things across most of the library.\n\nAnd we could go on: Bounding Box, Interpreter, GBA to GCN connectivity, GPU Syncing, Mouse Locking, and still more! There's even a lengthy dev diary at the end for good measure explaining how the great mystery of Pokemon Box's was finally solved. The only way to do it justice is to do it right. So buckle up and get ready for the April and May MEGA Progress Report."

For a developer coming from Python or Node eco system - the dotnet or dotnet core environment will be over whelming. Minimal APIs will help new developers to build their first ASP.NET Core apps with less ceremony. This will also helps developers to build small microservices and HTTP APIs. This feature is released as part of .NET Core 6.0 Preview 4 - which released along with Microsoft Build 2021 few days back. To get started, you need to create an ASP.NET Core empty web app, you can do this with the command dotnet new web. Once you created the project you will get a directory structure like this."
