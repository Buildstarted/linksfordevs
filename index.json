The main\nmotivation for this post is to dispel some false notions about\nmanifolds—the term has been so common in certain circles that it is\nalmost synonymous with ‘data.’ However, as I tried to explain in my\nprevious post, a manifold is a space that is exceptionally\nwell-behaved and, most importantly, homogeneous.1 To reiterate my favourite\ndefinition:2 a d-dimensional manifold M is a space that\nlocally looks like a d-dimensional Euclidean space, i.e. like some\nRd. The important thing is that d must not vary;\nevery point in M needs to satisfy this definition for the\nsame value of d."
