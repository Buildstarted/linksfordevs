His story intertwines erudition, success, political controversy, out-there contrarianism, and ideological views that sometimes seem self-contradictory. His position in popular culture reminds of a conservative George Soros: an academic philosopher turned financier, heavily politically active, and vilified by the opposition press. They are exceptionally successful investors, each cementing their status with one legendary deal.1 Their empires sprawl so far that they always show up somewhere if you dig far enough – turning them into Keyser Soze-style boogeymen to their detractors."

The intent of these principles is to guide decision making, and the most important of these is customer obsession. It’s the idea that treating your customers right is not just the right thing to do, it’s also good for business. We all buy from Amazon.com because it’s better than the competition. Shipping is cheaper and faster; they generally have a larger selection than the competition, and they make very, very few mistakes with shipping."
