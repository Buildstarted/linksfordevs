But there was an evaluation committee that had to try  to help\n  us along, and help us ultimately decide which way we were going to\n  separate the uranium.  This committee had men like Compton and Tolman\n  and Smyth and Urey and Rabi and Oppenheimer on it.  I would sit in\n  because I understood the theory of how our process of separating\n  isotopes worked, so they'd ask me questions and talk about it.  In\n  these discussions, one man would make a point.  Then Compton, for\n  example, would explain a different point of view.  He would say it\n  should be this way, and he was perfectly right.  Another guy\n  would say, well, maybe, but there is this other possibility that we\n  have to consider against it.",
