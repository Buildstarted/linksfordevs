You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.\n\nEver wondered how World of Warcraft private servers actually work behind the scenes? In this video, I dive deep into the C++ source code of AzerothCore, explaining the architecture, networking, and gameplay logic that makes these servers possible.\n\nWe’ll walk through how the server handles client connections, authentication, packet parsing, and game world simulation. I’ll also highlight some of the clever software engineering tricks and reverse engineering techniques used by developers to recreate the server side.\n\nWhether you’re interested in game development, MMORPG server emulation, or just curious about the C++ code that powers private servers, this breakdown will give you an inside look at the technical details and architecture that make it all work.\nIf you enjoy this kind of code review and game architecture analysis, check out my other videos on Doom, Quake, Diablo, and more classic game engines!\n\nHelp me get better equipment:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/tariq10x/\n\nhttps://x.com/realtariq10x\n\nMy Equipment: \nKeyboard:\nhttps://amzn.to/4nnCw6V\nDrawing Tablet:\nhttps://amzn.to/3FY1BEM\nMicrophone:\nhttps://amzn.to/4emo9vn\n\nSources:\nPrivate servers projects:\nhttps://www.getmangos.eu\nhttps://www.trinitycore.org\nhttps://www.azerothcore.org\n\nAzerothCore Github:\nhttps://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk\n\nWowDev Wiki:\nhttps://wowdev.wiki/Main_Page\nhttps://wowdev.wiki/Login\nhttps://wowdev.wiki/Login_Packet\nhttps://wowdev.wiki/World_Packet\n\nInteresting blog about private servers work:\nhttps://medium.com/@borzifrancesco/the-role-of-open-source-in-wow-private-servers-how-they-work-technically-and-why-i-hate-most-of-2dc1aa0dfb2e\n\nIf you like the content hit subscribe to support the channel. \n\n00:00 WoW\n01:44 Roadmap \n02:45 Client Server Architecture \n07:27 Reverse Engineering\n10:10 Emerging Projects \n11:57 AzerothCore\n12:54 Architecture AzerothCore\n14:40 Login Procedure\n16:34 World Server Communication\n19:35 Code Analysis\n21:20 Main.cpp AuthServer\n34:17 AuthSession.cpp Authentication Handler\n47:04 Main.cpp WorldServer\n52:23 WorldSocket.cpp\n55:03 WorldSession.cpp\n57:40 Conclusion\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant\n\nSong Credits:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAll songs Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

In this case our query is online tokenizer Add spaces between the tokens from the tokenizer output for your new query: online tokenizer → online token izer Potentially pull up new and previously unseen search results online tokenizer DuckDuckGo Original query results: Tokenized query results: Some of the result differences: I intend to study this more in depth eventually, if you want you can find my progress here: github.",

Where Harari spins a neat story about European exploration driven by academic curiosity and enlightenment values, Frankopan provides the messy, complicated, properly researched truth: Columbus was a religious zealot seeking the Great Khan to fight a holy war.\n",
