      <description>So, I haven't posted much in the past four months. That‚Äôs because my head has been buried in a study guide while working toward ISC2's CISSP. I've completed quite a few certifications in the past‚Äîstarting with entry-level ones and moving into some offensive security-specific certs‚Äîbut this was going to be the first that covered what would become a recurring phrase over the next few months: the "Common Body of Knowledge" of cybersecurity.I knew a few people who had already passed the CISSP, and I</description>

      <description>One workout doesn‚Äôt make you an athlete any more than one cigarette makes you a smoker. But you are an accumulation of your recurring choices and actions. We set goals to motivate ourselves. But, of course, we‚Äôre better at setting goals than reaching them. This is because motivation is fickle.</description>

      <description>The advent of cluely and the ever growing arms race between the interviewer and the interviewee is a fascinating phenomenon to me. Betting that people would prefer cheating or that companies needed screen for cheaters because the use of LLMs is heavily discourage seems to go against the common experience that LLMs do accelerate or improve the productivity of developers overall (with caveats of course).</description>

      <description>Motivation
    I‚Äôm a very insecure guy.
In fact, that was first real feedback that I received from a manager (now a dear friend), ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exceptionally good in your tasks, but damn, you‚Äôre too insecure about yourself‚Äù,
this trait got in my way in a various situations like defending a technical decision to other devs. This was last year, since it a lot of stuff happened:
I joined a Bitcoin developer launchpad where I had the opportunity to meet extremely talented people; started to learn Rust and contribute to Open Source; got
the second place
in a hackathon; did a talk in the greatest cybersecurity event of Latin America; started to do english classes with an amazing teacher, and, started to work at Turso as Open Source contributor in project Limbo.</description>
