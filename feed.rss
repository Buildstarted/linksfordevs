      <title>CS 6120: The Self-Guided Course</title>
      <link>https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2023fa/self-guided/</link>
      <description>CS 6120 is a PhD-level Cornell CS course by Adrian Sampson on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class.</description>

      <description>Last week, someone leaked a spreadsheet of SoundThinking sensors to
Wired.
You are probably asking &amp;quot;What is SoundThinking,&amp;quot; because the company rebranded
last year. They used to be called ShotSpotter, and their outdoor acoustic
gunfire detection system still goes by the ShotSpotter name.</description>

      <title>Price fixing by algorithm is still price fixing</title>
      <link>https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing</link>
      <description>Landlords and property managers can’t collude on rental pricing. Using new technology to do it doesn’t change that antitrust fundamental. Regardless of the industry you’re in, if your business uses an algorithm to determine prices, a brief filed by the FTC and the Department of Justice offers a helpful guideline for antitrust compliance: your algorithm can’t do anything that would be illegal if done by a real person.</description>

      <title>Language Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution</title>
      <link>https://aaronlou.com/blog/2024/discrete-diffusion/</link>
      <description>Modern large language models (like ChatGPT) learn to generate new samples by modeling the data distribution of natural text. However, the underlying methodology has largely remained stagnant over the last century: although different architectures have been developed, models are all based on autoregressive modeling (i.e. next token prediction). In this blog post, I will talk about our work on Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models, an alternative probablistic modeling technique that achieves highly competitive performance (at the scale of GPT-2) while introducing distinct algorithmic benefits. Our empirical results challenge the longstanding dominance of autoregressive modeling and can potentially pave the way for an alternative class of language models built from radically different principles.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://alexkritchevsky.com/2024/02/28/geometric-algebra.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about writing this post for a long time. Normally I haunt the comment section on Hacker News and whenever an article about GA comes up I post something to the effect of: “GA is okay but it’s not as good as those people say, there’s something wrong with it, what you really want is the wedge product on its own!” Which is not especially productive and probably slightly unhinged. So today I want to actually make that point in one central place that I can link to instead.</description>

      <title>Next.js first impressions</title>
      <link>https://maged.com/nextjs-first-impressions</link>
      <description>I started a new web app recently and was surprised to see the official React documentation pushes users to Next.js when starting a new project.
This is crazy!
React is actively moving potential users away from using it directly and onto an abstraction layer on top of it.
The world’s most popular framework is willingly giving up that title.</description>

      <title>Chit in the Game</title>
      <link>https://ke9v.net/2024/02/24/chit-in-game.html</link>
      <description>My friend Steve, N8GNJ and the editor of the Zero Retries Newsletter has been pitching ideas lately about how to grow the amateur service. It’s admirable and ambitious, but I generally avoid this issue because a) I have no viable solution to offer, and b) I don’t believe anyone else has one either. When it comes to growing the amateur radio service, I’m a fatalist. I believe ham radio will shrink until it’s gone. Given that, looking for solutions are a waste of my time.</description>
