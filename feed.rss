      <title>CatMeows: A Publicly-Available Dataset of Cat Vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://zenodo.org/record/4008297</link>
      <description>Abstract This dataset,&amp;#160;composed of 440 sounds, contains&amp;#160;meows emitted by cats in different contexts. Specifically, 21 cats belonging to 2 breeds (Maine Coon and European Shorthair) have been repeatedly exposed to three different stimuli that were expected to induce the emission of meows: Brushing - Cats were brushed by their owners in their home environment for a maximum of 5 minutes; Isolation in an unfamiliar environment - Cats were transferred by their owners into an unfamiliar environment (e.g., a room in a different apartment or an office). Distance was minimized and the usual transportation routine was adopted so as to avoid discomfort to animals. The journey lasted less than 30 minutes and cats were allowed 30 minutes with their owners to recover from transportation, before being isolated in the unfamiliar environment, where they stayed alone for maximum 5 minutes; Waiting for food - The owner started the routine operations that preceded food delivery in the usual environment the cat was familiar with. Food was given at most 5 minutes after the beginning of the experiment. The dataset has been produced and employed in the context of an interdepartmental project of the University of Milan (for further information, please refer to this doi). The content of the dataset has been described in detail in a scientific work currently under review; the reference will be provided as soon as the paper is published. File naming conventions&amp;#160; Files containing meows are in the dataset.zip archive. They are PCM streams (.wav). Naming conventions follow the pattern&amp;#160;C_NNNNN_BB_SS_OOOOO_RXX, which has to be exploded as follows: C = emission context (values: B =&amp;#160;brushing; F =&amp;#160;waiting for food; I: isolation in an unfamiliar environment); NNNNN = cat’s unique ID; BB = breed (values: MC =&amp;#160;Maine Coon; EU: European Shorthair); SS = sex (values: FI = female, intact; FN: female, neutered; MI: male, intact; MN: male, neutered); OOOOO = cat owner’s unique ID; R = recording session (values: 1, 2 or 3) XX = vocalization counter (values: 01..99) Extra content The extra.zip&amp;#160;archive contains excluded recordings (sounds other than meows emitted by cats) and uncut sequences of close vocalizations. Terms of use The dataset is open access&amp;#160;for scientific research and non-commercial purposes. The authors require to acknowledge their work and, in case of scientific publication,&amp;#160;to cite the most suitable reference among the following entries: Ntalampiras, S., Ludovico, L.A., Presti, G., Prato Previde, E., Battini, M., Cannas, S., Palestrini, C., Mattiello, S.: Automatic Classification of Cat Vocalizations Emitted in Different Contexts.

      <title>PipeWire: The Linux audio/video bus</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/847412/</link>
      <description>For more than a decade, PulseAudio
has been serving the Linux desktop as its predominant audio
mixing and routing daemon — and its audio API. Unfortunately,
PulseAudio&amp;#39;s internal architecture does not fit the growing
sandboxed-applications use case, even though there have been attempts to amend that. PipeWire, a new daemon created (in part)
out of these attempts, will replace
PulseAudio in the upcoming Fedora 34 release. It is a coming
transition that deserves a look.</description>

      <title>Croc Full Plaintext Recovery - CVE-2021-31603</title>
      <link>https://redrocket.club/posts/croc/</link>
      <description>TL;DR This blog post describes various security vulnerabilities we found within the popular file sharing service croc. These vulnerabilities can be chained together to launch file interception attacks against croc’s relay server.
With this practical attack, a remote attacker is able to intercept and decrypt all files sent via croc. An attacker does not need to host a malicious croc gateway, but is able to exploit any gateway. At the bottom of the blog post is a video of the attack.</description>

      <title>The ARM processor (Thumb-2), part 15: Miscellaneous instructions | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210618-00/?p=105324</link>
      <description>There are far more ARM instructions than I’m going to cover here. I’ve skipped over the floating point instructions, the SIMD instructions, and some other specialty instructions that I haven’t yet seen come out of the compiler.
