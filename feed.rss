      <title>How to buy Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations, and how to get it for free</title>
      <link>https://micahflee.com/2024/01/how-to-buy-hacks-leaks-and-revelations-and-how-to-get-it-for-free/</link>
      <description>Today, my book Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data is available for sale wherever books are sold! My goal with this book is to teach journalists, researchers, and activists all the skills they need to download and analyze any datasets they get their hands on, finding all of the juicy revelations they might contain. No prior experience is required. You can think of following along with my book as taking a complete course where you&amp;#39;ll download real leaked datasets, and then (by following alongside the exercises) learn the tools and coding required to analyze them. The paperback costs about $50 and the ebook costs about $40. However, I don&amp;#39;t want the price to be a barrier to access to anyone who needs this information. For this reason, I also decided to release the book for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. In other words, I&amp;#39;m giving away the PDF version for free.</description>

      <description>In every day or professional life, there can be many opportunities to provide feedback, whether it’s from a manager to a team member or the reverse. It could also be to a colleague, a customer or even a friend. However, it’s a challenging and difficult task, mastering it is a true art. Without understanding the best practices, there’s a risk of achieving counterproductive results.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Plex Hosting After the Hetzner Ban</title>
      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/rethinking-plex-hosting-after-the-hetzner-ban/</link>
      <description>Last October, Plex started blocking access to instances running on servers hosted by Hetzner.
I have a Hetzner Auction server that I renew every year or so to make use of newer hardware, which I use to run various workloads, from web services, to scheduled jobs and self-hosted instances of privacy-friendly alternative web frontends like Nitter.
Another one of those workloads, until recently, was Plex.
I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t have the time to put too much effort into getting around the Hetzner network ban when it was first implemented, so I just started running Jellyfin instead.</description>

      <title>Format ChatGPT results with PydanticOutputParser - LangChain #2</title>
      <link>https://goatreview.com/format-chatgpt-results-with-pydantic-langchain-2/</link>
      <description>Tackling the variability in ChatGPT outputs requires a methodical and structured approach. Pydantic, a Python library, steps up to this challenge, offering a robust framework for defining and validating structured data models. This ensures that the parsing of ChatGPT&amp;#39;s outputs is both consistent and reliable.

      <title>Mixtral of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088</link>
      <description>We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>
