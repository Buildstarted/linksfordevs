      <link>https://blog.sesse.net/blog/tech/2024-06-28-19-12_this_is_how_people_think_about_security.html</link>
      <description>I borrowed a 3D printer with Octoprint set up,
and happened to access it from work, whereupon I was greeted with a big
scary message and a link to this blog post.
Even though it is from 2018, there seems to be no retraction, so I figured
it&amp;#39;s an interesting insight in how people seem to think about security:</description>

      <title>What Is Soap Made Of?</title>
      <link>https://www.august.build/post/what-is-soap-really-made-of</link>
      <description>One day while I was washing my hands, I looked down at the bar of soap and wondered, what is this soap made of? I thought about it as my hands lathered up, and soon realized I have absolutely no idea.</description>

      <title>Understanding Input Masking in Llm Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://saeedesmaili.com/posts/understanding-input-masking-in-llm-finetuning/</link>
      <description>I’ve been using conversational alpaca or sharegpt formats for fine-tuning LLMs with Axolotl , but it always felt unnecessary to limit the model on a conversational format when the use-case doesn’t require so.
I’m currently working on a project to classify pull requests in my company’s code repositories. The model needs to look at the PR title, description, and code changes, then categorize the PR and explain its reasoning. I thought there must be a way to fine-tune these models with any format I see fitting this specific use-case, and sure there is: Template-free Axolotl This seemed exactly what I was looking for, but the emphais on “masking inputs” made me confused:</description>

      <title>How I overcame my addiction to sugar</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/how-i-overcame-my-addiction-to-sugar/</link>
      <description>Photo by Suzy Hazelwood
I remember my breakfast as a kid. It was as sugary as it gets, with cereal and milk or a good marmalade toast and a chocolate shake to start my day.
I remember the highs and lows of my energy levels throughout the day or how I would look in the mirror and wonder why I grew as a chubby kid instead of thinner and stronger like some friends.</description>

      <title>A Bunch of Programming Advice I’d Give To Myself 15 Years Ago</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/programming-advice-younger-self/</link>
      <description>I finally have the feeling that I&amp;amp;rsquo;m a decent programmer, so I thought it would be fun to write some advice with the idea of &amp;amp;ldquo;what would have gotten me to this point faster?&amp;amp;rdquo; I&amp;amp;rsquo;m not claiming this is great advice for everyone, just that it would have been good advice for me.
If you (or your team) are shooting yourselves in the foot constantly, fix the gun I can&amp;amp;rsquo;t tell you how many times I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve been on a team and there&amp;amp;rsquo;s something about the system that&amp;amp;rsquo;s very easy to screw up, but no one thinks about ways to make it harder to make that mistake.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT is bullshit - Ethics and Information Technology</title>
      <link>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5</link>
      <description>Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.</description>
