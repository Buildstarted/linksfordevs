      <title>Parser Combinators Beat Regexes</title>
      <link>https://entropicthoughts.com/parser-combinators-beat-regexes</link>
      <description>Someone online was solving Advent of Code problems, and had a question about
last years’ day 3. They had a working solution using regular expressions
(regexes) on String values, but they wanted to use ByteString values instead
for performance reasons. They were surprised, however, that there seems to be a
lack of community cohesion around regex libraries in Haskell.</description>

      <link>https://alexpetralia.com/2025/04/03/a-guide-for-future-managers/</link>
      <description>As individuals are hired into an organization, they are typically screened first and foremost for “hard skills”. If you’re an engineer, do you know how to code, architect a system, or evaluate the tradeoffs of any particular implementation? If a financial analyst, do you know how to build a discounted cash flow model, or reconcile income statements to cash flows? Hard skills compose the tactile interface through which employees interact with technology and systems.</description>
