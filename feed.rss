      <title>Track HN: Score and Rank History (plus My Nocode Experiences)</title>
      <link>https://nami.land/2024/05/10/track-hn-rank-history.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been working on the project Track HN for a while now. The HN dataset is perfect to play with. It’s a vivid engaging forum about interesting topics from a community of hackers, with a ranking mechanism provided by algorithm plus human interference. It’s not so large as to require impossible resources for me to process. It just has so much potential.</description>

      <title>Currency Hedging and Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://dm13450.github.io/2024/04/25/Currency-Hedging-and-Principal-Component-Analysis.html</link>
      <description>Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces a dataset to its main components. When we apply it to a dataset of different currencies it helps us understand how each currency drives the overall portfolio and what currency might be a common factor.</description>

      <title>From almost bankruptcy to $1M in revenue in 2.5 years: Cogno AI</title>
      <link>https://picklerooms.com/blogs/origin-stories/cogno-ai</link>
      <description>Like a plot from a Silicon Valley drama, Cogno AI flipped the script from teetering on the financial abyss to banking $1 million in revenue in a brisk 2.5 years. A fresh-faced grad, Aman Goel (and his co-founder) launched an AI startup with dreams far bigger than their bank account (not uncommon right?).</description>

      <title>A Better Lesson – Rodney Brooks</title>

      <description>Just last week Rich Sutton published a very short blog post titled  The Bitter Lesson. I’m going to try to keep this review shorter than his post. Sutton is well known for his long and sustained contributions to reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Readability of Optimized Kotlin Code</title>
      <link>https://www.romainguy.dev/posts/2024/readability-of-optimized-kotlin-code/</link>
      <description>Leland and I were recently discussing how to best implement a new data structure to speed up a specific aspect of Jetpack Compose. He came up with a great idea, and nerd sniped me in the process. The problem was to efficiently encode the occupancy of an 8x8 grid represented as a Long (each bit representing a cell in the grid).
After coming up with the bit twiddling code that quickly “rasterizes” a rectangle into the grid as a bitfield, I found myself thinking about how incredibly helpful Kotlin can be at making low-level/micro-optimized code easy to read1 for users of an API.</description>

      <title>Building intuition with spaced repetition systems</title>
      <link>https://jacobgw.com/blog/tft/2024/05/12/srs-intuit.html</link>
      <description>Do you ever go to a lecture, follow it thinking it makes total sense, then look back at your notes later and realize it makes no sense? This used to happen to me, but I’ve learned how to use spaced repetition to fully avoid this if I want. I’m going to try to convey this method in this post.</description>
