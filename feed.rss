      <title>The Therac-25 Incident</title>
      <link>https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-therac-25-incident</link>
      <description>
A few months ago, someone noted in the comments that they hadn't heard about the Therac-25 incident. I was surprised, and went off to do an informal survey of developers I know, only to discover that only about half of them knew what it was without searching for it.
I think it's important that everyone in our industry know about this incident, and upon digging into the details I was stunned by how much of a WTF there was.
Today's article is not fun, or funny. It describes incidents of death and maiming caused by faulty software engineering processes. If that's not what you want today, grab a random article from our archive, instead.

When you're strapping a patient to an electron gun capable of delivering a 25MeV particle beam, following procedure is vitally important. The technician operating the Therac-25 radiotherapy machine at the East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC) had been running this machine, and those like it, long enough that she had the routine down.

Hello, everybody. I'm Nick, and in this video, I will go through the Discriminated Unions or simply Unions proposal which tried to explain all the Union related features that are coming in C# 15 as a preview and hopefully C# 16 as a fully fledged feature.

      <title>A Randomized Algorithm for Single-Source Shortest Path on Undirected Real-Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04139</link>
      <description>In undirected graphs with real non-negative weights, we give a new randomized algorithm for the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem with running time $O(m\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log\log n})$ in the comparison-addition model. This is the first algorithm to break the $O(m+n\log n)$ time bound for real-weighted sparse graphs by Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci heaps. Previous undirected non-negative SSSP algorithms give time bound of $O(mα(m,n)+\min\{n\log n, n\log\log r\})$ in comparison-addition model, where $α$ is the inverse-Ackermann function and $r$ is the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum edge weight [Pettie &amp; Ramachandran 2005], and linear time for integer edge weights in RAM model [Thorup 1999]. Note that there is a proposed complexity lower bound of $Ω(m+\min\{n\log n, n\log\log r\})$ for hierarchy-based algorithms for undirected real-weighted SSSP [Pettie &amp; Ramachandran 2005], but our algorithm does not obey the properties required for that lower bound. As a non-hierarchy-based approach, our algorithm shows great advantage with much simpler structure, and is much easier to implement.</description>

      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2025/08/25/a-bluesky-mystery</link>
      <description>UPDATE: I heard back from Bryan Newbold, protocol engineer at Bluesky, about this. It seems this is an issue with the AppView layer of the protocol when it comes to large threads. There’s a new API in the works that’s set to help out with this problem. I’m glad to hear it wasn’t just me missing something obvious! The original post follows below.</description>

      <title>Skip the Next iPhone</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/skip-the-next-iphone</link>
      <description>There’s a ritual that happens every September. Apple unveils its latest iPhone, and millions of us suddenly discover that the device in our pocket—the one we loved just yesterday—has become obsolete.
It’s marketing genius, really. The same phone that was “revolutionary” twelve months ago is now just…old.
Big tech companies have mastered the art of manufactured desire. Apple and Samsung don’t need to release a new phone every year—the technological leaps between generations have become increasingly small. But why wait three years when you can extract revenue annually?</description>

      <description>I recently ran a book club at Seeq for the book Release It! by Michael T. Nygard. It’s a new entry on my list of recommended books for all software engineers - platform engineers included. There are a bunch of great, practical insights to be harvested. Throughout the book, I found myself reflecting on the systems I work on at Seeq or even checking code to verify some detail that Nygard had brought to mind.</description>

      <title>rv, a new kind of Ruby management tool</title>
      <link>https://andre.arko.net/2025/08/25/rv-a-new-kind-of-ruby-management-tool/</link>
      <description>For the last ten years or so of working on Bundler, I’ve had a wish rattling around: I want a better dependency manager. It doesn’t just manage your gems, it manages your ruby versions, too. It doesn’t just manage your ruby versions, it installs pre-compiled rubies so you don’t have to wait for ruby to compile from source every time. And more than all of that, it makes it completely trivial to run any script or tool written in ruby, even if that script or tool needs a different ruby than your application does.</description>
