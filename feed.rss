Congratulations, you won the lottery! You can barely believe your eyes as you
stand there holding the winning ticket! It&amp;#39;s amazing - so many feelings rush
over you as you realize that some of your dreams are within reach now! You run
over, nay, you float over to the lottery office to collect your winnings in
pure excitement. You push open the doors to the building, scamper up to the
front desk, present your ticket to the clerk, and the exchange goes something

      <title>Against moderation - John&amp;#39;s internet house</title>
      <link>https://www.johnwhiles.com/posts/against-moderation.html</link>
      <description>When people want to change themselves, their habits, their lifestyles, the approach they usually take is to moderate or attenuate existing behaviour. We take what we are already doing, gently change it in the way that seems the least disruptive and painful and hope that over time we will gradually reach our desired state. We might see that we are physically unfit, and start trying to walk more instead of driving. Or we might realise that we drink too much and decide to try cut down the amount of alcohol we consume.</description>

started keeping score of who won our Magic games. I didn&amp;#39;t know what I wanted to
do with it, but after sitting on it for 2 years I think it&amp;#39;s ripe for some
initial analysis of my data set. I obviously will keep tracking games, but for
now, I was curious how things were shaping up.

      <description>C# 11 is the next version of C# coming in .NET 7, and it is introducing a warning wave that issues a warning when a type is declared with all lower-case letters. This is being done so that in the future the language can begin moving away from conditional keywords and instead use full on keywords instead. The warning is alerting customers to types that may become keywords in future versions.</description>

      <title>Nullable reference types in C# - Migrating to nullable reference types - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2022/04/11/nullable-reference-types-in-csharp-migrating-to-nullable-reference-types-part-1.html</link>

      <title>The Joy of Small Projects</title>
      <link>https://schroer.ca/2022/04/10/the-joy-of-small-projects/</link>
      <description>When was the last time you completed a project? When was the last time you started a project?
