      <title>If you&amp;#39;re going to configure a header file, you have to do it before you include the header file</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211209-00/?p=106017</link>
      <description>In Windows, if you want the windows.h header file to default to the Unicode character set, you need to define the UNICODE symbol: #define UNICODE #include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;  There’s no point defining the symbol after the horse has left the barn: // Code in italics is wrong #include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>.NET 6 vs .NET 4.8 GC stats - ~64% shorter max GC pause times (due to 1 letter removed in runtime)</title>
      <link>https://nietras.com/2021/11/26/dotnet-6-vs-4-8-gc-stats/</link>
      <description>Recently I tweeted about performance
improvements we
are seeing from migrating an industrial machine learning application (desktop)
from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 6 which got more likes than any blog post I’ve
made before. Additionally, Alex Yakunin’s blog post on .NET 6 vs .NET 5: up to
40% speedup!
got some hacker news love, so I thought I’d give the crowd what it wants and
turn the tweets into a quick blog post. &amp;#128521;
