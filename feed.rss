Great video games can come from combining genres - but getting the mix right isn&amp;#39;t easy. In this video we&amp;#39;ll explore the three main methods for merging genres, and look at the problems - and solutions - of each approach.

      <title>Matt Warren - Performance in the .NET Runtime - NDC London 2022</title>
      <link>https://yt.artemislena.eu/YcZ-nZa2XgA</link>
      <description>We often take the .NET Runtime for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!

In this talk we&amp;#39;ll take a walk through the internals of the &amp;#39;Common Language Runtime&amp;#39; (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering &amp;#39;Value Types&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Tiered Compilation&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Stubs&amp;#39; and more.

Afterwards, you&amp;#39;ll never take a simple &amp;#39;method call&amp;#39; for granted again!!

      <title>Why Is the Web So Monotonous? Google. :: Reasonably Polymorphic</title>
      <link>https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/monotonous-web/index.html</link>
      <description>Does it ever feel like the internet is getting worse? That’s been my impression for the last decade. The internet feels now like it consists of ten big sites, plus fifty auxiliary sites that come up whenever you search for something outside of the everyday ten. It feels like it’s harder to find amateur opinions on matters, except if you look on social media, where amateur opinions are shared, unsolicited, with much more enthusiasm than they deserve. The accessibility of the top ten seems like it collapses the internet into a monoculture of extremism, and, perhaps even more disappointingly, a monoculture that echos the offline world.</description>

      <title>On Being Rich-ish: Lessons I learned becoming suddenly middle-class</title>
      <link>https://www.residentcontrarian.com/p/on-being-rich-ish-lessons-i-learned</link>
      <description>There once was a guy who was very, very broke. To be clear, he wasn’t the brokest guy you’ve ever heard of. There were poorer people (he knew some, even) but he did spend a long, long time trying to raise a family on not a lot of money; think “a family of four on 35k or less in a major metropolitan area” destitute.</description>

      <link>https://resoto.com/blog/2022/07/28/what-is-cloud-asset-inventory</link>
      <description>On March 14, 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched S3, the first public cloud service. Since then, cloud consumption has increased each year. Gartner estimates that worldwide spend on public cloud services will reach $600 billion in 2023, up from $410 billion in 2021. At annual growth rates of over 20%, the trillion-dollar market size is only a few years away.</description>

      <title>Prevent Forwarded header spoofing with HTTP message signature</title>
      <link>https://raphael.medaer.me/2022/08/04/prevent-forwarded-header-spoofing.html</link>
      <description>The Forwarded HTTP header has been introduced in RFC7239 from June 2014. It “defines an HTTP extension header field that allows proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying process, for example, the originating IP address(…)”. However there is not any mechanism to protect subsequent component against spoofing. Indeed, if your subsequent component, let’s say an API, is exposed on Internet, anyone can forge a HTTP Forwarded header. If your API is always behind your proxy, it has to remove/replace the original Forwarded header. It becomes even more complex if you have multiple proxies.</description>

      <title>Matt Warren - Performance in the .NET Runtime - NDC London 2022</title>
      <link>https://video.weiler.rocks/watch?v=YcZ-nZa2XgA</link>
      <description>We often take the .NET Runtime for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!

In this talk we&amp;#39;ll take a walk through the internals of the &amp;#39;Common Language Runtime&amp;#39; (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering &amp;#39;Value Types&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Tiered Compilation&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Stubs&amp;#39; and more.

Afterwards, you&amp;#39;ll never take a simple &amp;#39;method call&amp;#39; for granted again!!

      <description>When you have multiple instances of Visual Studio open at the same time, it can be tricky to tell them apart. Especially if you’re working on different branches of the same solution, which makes them look almost identical. What if each instance could have a unique color so you could instantly tell them apart?</description>
