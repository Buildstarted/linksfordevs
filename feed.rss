      <title>Tip 330 - How to use Azure API Management from VS Code</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip330.html</link>
      <description>When you expose an API that other people use, you want full control over who uses it and how they use it. You can use Azure API Management (opens new window) for that. You import API definitions into Azure API Management and create a facade API that users communicate with. This allows you to create products (opens new window) for your API, and monitor and manage API usage and access with policies (opens new window). API Management also enables you to manage versions (opens new window) of your API. It also allows you to design the API methods (opens new window) and documentation that you expose, so that it works for your users, regardless of what the original API looks like. And you can run API Management in several usage tiers (opens new window), including a consumption tier, which is billed per execution.</description>

      <description>&amp;#160; Proxy in Azure Function App&amp;#160;is often used for&amp;#160;specifying endpoints on your function app that are implemented by another resource.

      <description>This is a surprisingly common problem in C#, where you need to take a DateTime and strip off the “time” bit to leave you with a representation of a day. Currently, you can do it by creating a new DateTime and passing only the parts you want to keep, like year, month, and day.</description>

      <title>My experience dealing with Microsoft in the old Windows Phone times</title>
      <link>https://blog.kulman.sk/dealing-with-microsoft-in-wp-times/</link>
      <description>This summer marks exactly a decade since I started doing mobile apps development. My first mobile app was called MyTVShows and was released to the Windows Phone Store in summer of 2011.
The app solved a practical problem for me, keeping track of new episodes. I later rewrote the app as TvTime which was one of my most successful Windows Phone apps.

  
  
  


My times of doing Windows Phone development are long over as the platform has been dead for many years but this reminded me of all the struggles I had to deal with when interacting with the local Microsoft branch.
Disclaimer: Microsoft is a huge company so my experience is hopefully not the general experience of everyone from those times, people on all the local branches are different.
Windows Phone app competitions
In 2012 the Czech Microsoft started a competition giving every developer a Nokia Lumia 800 for publishing 3 apps to the Windows Phone Store.
The problem was the quality of those apps did not matter at all. The goal was to increases the number of the apps as much as possible, probably reaching some arbitrary number set by Redmond.

  
  
  


The Czech Windows Phone Store was flooded by crappy apps created only because of this competition, not having any real value for the user. I remember an app with one input and one button doing some kind of number conversion.
Microsoft just wanted to bump the app numbers count by any means necessary to be able to compare the Windows Phone Store to other mobile app stores.
This also reminded me that Microsoft was really bad at competitions overall, another example was destroying DVLUP after purchasing Nokia.</description>

      <description>Staying in academia requires, among other things, a healthy dose of
humour. Its is therefore not surprising that many academical aspects are
likened to more whimsical pursuits. The great Matt Might,

nine kinds of students you will meet in the
classroom and
the types of reviewers you will face
in terms of characters from the game Team Fortress 2.</description>

      <title>Token Authentication for&amp;#160;django-rest-framework — /var/</title>
      <link>https://spapas.github.io/2021/08/25/django-token-rest-auth/</link>
      <description>In a a previous article
I explained how to authenticate for your django-rest-framework API
using the django-rest-auth package.
Since then I have observed that various things have changed and most importantly that
the library I used there (django-rest-auth) is not updated anymore and has been
superseded by another one. Also, some of my information there is contradictory,
especially the parts that deal with the session authentication and csrf&amp;#160;protection.</description>

      <title>Would the World Be a Better Place If More People Baked Bread?</title>
      <link>https://carolthecook.com/would-the-world-be-a-better-place-if-more-people-baked-bread/</link>
      <description>Nearly ten years ago, researchers from the University of Southern Brittany published a study in the Journal of Social Psychology that found the aroma of fresh baked bread made people nicer to strangers. In the study participants stood outside either a bakery or a clothing store and when passerby approached, they dropped something such as a pack of tissues or keys. Outside of the bakery 77% of the passerby helped pick up the dropped item while only 52% of passerby helped in front of the clothing store.</description>
