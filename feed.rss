      <title>We Deserve Better from Apple: Why I Can No Longer Recommend a Mac to Fellow Blind Computer Users</title>
      <link>https://www.applevis.com/blog/we-deserve-better-apple-why-i-can-no-longer-recommend-mac-fellow-blind-computer-users</link>
      <description>As many of you will know from personal experience, there is a longstanding issue with VoiceOver on Mac where Safari will frequently become unresponsive with VoiceOver repeatedly announcing the message “Safari not responding.” When this issue occurs, the user&amp;#39;s Mac may become unusable for up to several minutes at a time. Sometimes it can be resolved by switching away from Safari. Sometimes restarting VoiceOver can resolve the issue.</description>

      <title>Why is Debian the way it is?</title>
      <link>https://blog.liw.fi/posts/2023/debian-reasons/</link>
      <description>Debian is a large, complex operating system, and a huge open source project. It’s thirty years old now. To many people, some of its aspects are weird. Most such things have a good reason, but it can be hard to find out what it is. This is an attempt to answer some such questions, without being a detailed history of the project.</description>

      <title>Observing OSIRIS-REx during the capsule reentry – Daniel Est&amp;#233;vez</title>
      <link>https://destevez.net/2023/10/observing-osiris-rex-during-the-capsule-reentry/</link>
      <description>On September 24, the OSIRIX-REx sample return capsule landed in the Utah Test and Training Range at 14:52 UTC. The capsule had been released on a reentry trajectory by the spacecraft a few hours earlier, at 10:42 UTC. The spacecraft then performed an evasion manoeuvre at 11:02 and passed by Earth on a hyperbolic orbit with a perigee altitude of 773 km. The spacecraft has now continued to a second mission to study asteroid Apophis, and has been renamed as OSIRIS-APEX.</description>

      <title>The truth about distraction | Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <link>https://www.oliverburkeman.com/distraction</link>
      <description>The way we talk about distraction, especially digital distraction, has changed a lot in recent years. Before, most people thought of resisting distraction as a matter of willpower – of training your brain to focus, setting personal rules for when to check your phone, and so on, with the implication that if you failed, you were an ill-disciplined loser.</description>

      <link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/your-organization-probably-doesnt-want-to-improve-things/</link>
      <description>Last week, I had a fascinating conversation with a reader around frustration and unhappiness at work. Much of it was totally obvious to both of us, but it occurred to me that this probably isn&amp;#39;t to everyone, which is why almost all of my colleagues (in very cushy, non-stressful jobs) nonetheless need therapy. And if it isn&amp;#39;t obvious to everyone, it&amp;#39;s worth writing about.</description>
