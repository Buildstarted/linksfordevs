      <title>The Shape of Code &amp;#187; Software effort estimation is mostly fake research</title>
      <link>http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2021/01/17/software-effort-estimation-is-mostly-fake-research/</link>
      <description>Effort estimation is an important component of any project, software or otherwise.  While effort estimation is something that everybody in industry is involved with on a regular basis, it is a niche topic in software engineering research.  The problem is researcher attitude (e.g., they are unwilling to venture into the wilds of industry), which has stopped them acquiring the estimation data needed to build realistic models.  A few intrepid people have risked an assault on their ego and talked to people in industry, the outcome has been, until very recently, a small collection of tiny estimation datasets.</description>

      <title>Troy Hunt: Password Security Is the Name of the Game</title>
      <link>https://open.spotify.com/episode/2FL5zAHonjfOptTCACHnkN?si=3C_wBhS8RPyhE788WXRreQ</link>
      <description>Listen to this episode from under CTRL on Spotify. The security of the New World we are building online is heavily dependent on password security but, despite this, password reuse and negligence continue to be a problem for the world’s Web users. This lax approach has created the ideal environment for hackers to thrive,&amp;#160; as leaked credentials become replicated across the clean and dark web.&amp;#160;To help explore the mechanisms that power these exchanges, we’ve recruited security evangelist and&amp;#160;Have I Been Pwned founder Troy Hunt to join our resident cryptographic expert (and Tresorit CEO) Istvan Lam on under CTRL.&amp;#160;Stay tuned for news on the biggest threats in cyberspace, the logic behind staying quiet about data breaches and insight into some of the most infamous data breaches of all time.&amp;#160; </description>

      <title>Paper Reading: In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://yizhang82.dev/paper-raft</link>
      <description>This paper is the paper to read about Raft consensus algorithm and a good way to build intuition for consensus algorithms in general. The “consensus” about consensus algorithms is that they are hard to understand / build / test, and not surprisingly having an understandable consensus algorithm has a lot of value for system builders. I think Raft is designed for today’s mainstream single leader multi-follower log-replicated state machine model so it is a great starting point for building a practical distributed system around it. I’ve read about raft before but this is the first time I went through the paper in full. I must admit I find Paxos not intuitive and hard to follow as well and I might give Paxos/Multi-Paxos a go some other time. Meanwhile Raft is something I can get behind and feel comfortable with. And that is saying something.</description>
