everybody, but it may prove to be quite useful for some user communities.</description>

      <title>A truly Open Source MongoDB alternative</title>
      <link>https://www.mangodb.io/</link>
      <description>MongoDB is a life-changing technology for many Developers, empowering them to build applications faster than using relational databases. However, MongoDB abandoned its Open Source roots, changing the license to SSPL making it unusable for many Open Source and Commercial Projects. MangoDB is going to be a perfect solution for those looking for MongoDB development experience available as fully Open Source Software.</description>

      <title>The Data Behind New York&amp;#39;s Increasingly Dirty Electricity Peaks</title>
      <link>https://www.stevegattuso.me/2021/10/31/new-york-dirty-electricity-peaks.html</link>
      <description>For many New Yorkers, the hottest days of the summer are ones of refuge: staying indoors with our air conditioners on full-blast in an attempt to escape the heat. While flicking our ACs on during a hot day seems like an entirely mundane aspect of life, behind the scenes an immensely complex machine, our electricity grid, works in overtime to generate the electricity required to keep us cool.</description>

      <title>Your Users are on a Journey with your Product. As a Product Manager you are a Guide</title>

      <description>I must confess, I have a bad habit. I assume people see the world as I do.
When I look at a chart, I assume that others are seeing the chart as I do. I  understand what the chart is showing me, I assume others understand the chart as I do. When I can decipher and decode all the information shown to me, I assume others can too.
This would have happened to you too, when you shared a spreadsheet with a colleague, but they could make no sense of it.</description>
