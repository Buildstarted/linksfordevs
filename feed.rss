      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/353/implementing-a-custom-model-binder-in-razor-pages</link>
      <description>In Razor Pages, model binding is the process that maps data from an HTTP request to 
	simple PageModel properties or handler parameters. 
	Incoming data can be included in a request as posted form values, query 
	string values or route data. The default collection of model binders cover 
	every simple .NET data type.. But sometimes they are not enough, and you need to add 
	your own implementation.</description>

      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-an-ecs-cluster-and-deploy-apps-using-azure-devops/</link>

      <title>Convex and Concave Dispositions</title>
      <link>https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html</link>
      <description>One of the major philosophical differences that I have noticed in how people approach making large-scale decisions in the world is how they approach the age-old tradeoff of compromise versus purity. Given a choice between two alternatives, often both expressed as deep principled philosophies, do you naturally gravitate toward the idea that one of the two paths should be correct and we should stick to it, or do you prefer to find a way in the middle between the two extremes?</description>

      <link>https://samkhawase.com/blog/remote-work/</link>
      <description>The COVID-19 crisis, while disrupting the global world unlike anything before, has opened up an unexpected window to remote work. Nearly all major1tech2 giants3 have4 allowed their workers to do home office. Many people are considering this as a sign of the advent of Work 2.0, where physical offices spaces will be irrelevant, and people can work from their cozy dens. There are however significant challenges in adoption of generalized remote work and things will be back as usual once the COVID-19 ends.</description>

1. Writing solves problems.&amp;#160;

Not only did writing solve personal issues, but business</description>
