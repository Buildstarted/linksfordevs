      <description>The ReceiveArray pattern is the Windows Runtime pattern for how a function can return a C-style conformant array to its caller. In C++/WinRT, the projected version of the function is // [out] parameter void M(com_array&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;amp; value);  // return value com_array&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; M();</description>

      <title>Trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator based on the highest density interval of the given width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11776</link>
      <description>Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics
are a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples.
These estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always
good enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile
estimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this
approach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions,
it&amp;#39;s not robust. To be able to customize the trade-off between statistical
efficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the
Harrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics
with low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta
distribution.</description>

      <title>TPM remote attestation over Bluetooth</title>
      <link>https://gabriel.kerneis.info/2021/11/local_attestation/</link>
      <description>How can you be sure that the software running on your computer has not been tampered with since you installed it? Even if your disk is encrypted, how can you be sure that the password prompt at boot is not a trap planted by an evil third-party that will exfiltrate all your data? Those are the some of the questions that the field of “secure computing” tries to address. The answers are built through complex combinations of hardware (CPU, TPM, flash memory) and software (BIOS, OS) components.</description>

      <title>Finally A Personal Knowledge Management Tooling That Works - ulrichkautz.com</title>
      <link>https://ulrichkautz.com/posts/2021-11-24_personal-knowledge-management-that-works/</link>
      <description>I was interested in the topic of personal knowledge management since I first used a computer for learning. So far I could not find a solution that really worked well for me. Until now. I found my second brain. If you are a knowledge worker as well, are not gifted with a perfect memory and therefore need a tooling to help you manage the knowledge you learn - read on in the blog post.

      <title>How to Backup to Backblaze B2 with Rclone and keep the network alive</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m living in a place with not the fastest internet download/upload (39/12 Mbps) speeds. It took some time to tune all the parameters of the Rclone to successfully create an initial backup (around 400GB) and keep the network alive during the upload to Backblaze B2.

      <title>Practical Security Recommendations for Start-ups with Limited Budgets</title>
      <link>https://ajxchapman.github.io/security/2021/11/10/practical-security-recommendations-for-startups.html</link>
      <description>Hi, my name is Alex, I’ve been an IT security professional since 2007 and I’ve recently entered the start-up world with my project bughuntr.io. In putting together this project, security has been a primary concern for me. This is both due to my background and the nature of the project, being a training platform for security professionals and enthusiasts alike. In my security career, I’ve been hired to assess countless web applications, cloud environments and computer networks for security vulnerabilities. In these assessments, it is always clear when security is ‘bolted on’ as a compliance requirement before releasing a product, or added at a later date in response to an incident. Start-ups have a rare opportunity to ‘bake’ security in at the start of a project, but this is often seen as an expensive endeavor. In this post, I aim to ease that fear and provide practical (and cheap) advice for start-ups who want to release a more secure product right from the start.</description>

      <title>Simplicity always wins</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/simple-stacks-win/</link>
      <description>Software engineers love complexity. Complexity is an inherent part of writing software because the medium itself (programming languages) is complex on its own. When you put together with it the discipline of doing software engineering, where you add time constraints, customers, budgets and changing requirements… well… it’s complicated.
