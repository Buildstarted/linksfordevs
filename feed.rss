      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using Bash functions quite liberally over the past couple years, but
last week I discovered that they can be much better than I thought. In this
post, I&amp;#39;ll explain how I thought they worked, why I was wrong, and how that
makes them better.Function syntax</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Piano Practice — Fundamentals of Piano Practice</title>
      <link>https://fundamentals-of-piano-practice.readthedocs.io/</link>
      <description>This is the best book ever written on how to practice at the piano! Most books
list what skills are needed (scales, arpeggios, trills, etc.), but not how to
acquire them. This book teaches how to solve technical problems, step by step.
Learn practice methods, how to acquire technique and memorize hours of
repertoire, sight reading, musical playing, relaxation, etc., and, most
importantly, Mental Play in which you learn to play the piano in your mind.
Mental play touches every aspect of piano playing, from memorizing, controlling
nervousness, developing performance skills, playing musically, etc., to
acquiring absolute pitch, composing and improvisation. It is almost
unbelievable that such an essential skill has been mostly neglected by piano
teachers. All great musicians used it, yet even they often failed to teach it.
We learn why the traditional methods of teaching piano widely used today are
the reasons why students give up piano.</description>

      <title>Zettelkasten note-taking after one year &amp;#183; Tomas Vik</title>
      <link>https://blog.viktomas.com/posts/slip-box-after-a-year/</link>
      <description>I’ve been taking small, permanent, densely-linked notes for over a year. Now I’ll share how my understanding of the Zettelkasten (aka Slip-box) method changed and what I’ve learned. 16 months ago, I wrote a popular post about Zettelkasten. I wrote it right after reading the How to Take Smart Notes book. I’ve been taking smart notes since then. I changed my process and software, but the premise is still the same. This is my update.</description>
