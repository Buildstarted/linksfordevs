      <title>Deleting emails will not save the planet</title>
      <link>https://bertptrs.nl/2024/08/24/deleting-emails-will-not-save-the-planet.html</link>
      <description>A while ago I saw a post on LinkedIn that piqued my interest, not because it was any good, but because it was impressively wrong. It claimed that, to quote, “if every email user deleted just 10 emails, it would save enough electricity to power millions of households each year”. This is not only wrong, it is obviously wrong. In this post, I’d like to dive into why it’s wrong, how one might come to think it’s right, and perhaps what better message you could put out there to save the planet.</description>
