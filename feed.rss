      <title>The darker side of being a doctor</title>
      <link>https://drericlevi.substack.com/p/the-darker-side-of-being-a-doctor</link>
      <description>I’m a surgeon. I’d like to think that I’m resilient and well adjusted, having gone through medical school and rigorous surgical training. I’ve been a doctor for 13 years and much of that period has been spent training to be as good a surgeon as I could ever be. I have great family support, a physician wife who understands my work and I’ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness.</description>

      <title>Day 6 — flowblok’s blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2024-04/advent-of-code-2023-day-6.html</link>
      <description>Hurl is a dynamically-typed programming language that uses
exception handling as its only form of control flow.
Much of the syntax is unsurprising, but the forms of exception raising and
handling deserve close examination.</description>

      <title>How to write a code formatter</title>
      <link>https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/how-to-write-a-code-formatter/</link>
      <description>Ask ten developers how they think a certain piece of code should be formatted,
