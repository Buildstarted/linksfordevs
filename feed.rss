      <title>AbsenceBench: Language Models Can't Tell What's Missing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11440</link>
      <description>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of processing long inputs and locating specific information within them, as evidenced by their performance on the Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) test. However, while models excel at recalling surprising information, they still struggle to identify clearly omitted information. We introduce AbsenceBench to assesses LLMs' capacity to detect missing information across three domains: numerical sequences, poetry, and GitHub pull requests. AbsenceBench asks models to identify which pieces of a document were deliberately removed, given access to both the original and edited contexts. Despite the apparent straightforwardness of these tasks, our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieve only 69.6% F1-score with a modest average context length of 5K tokens. Our analysis suggests this poor performance stems from a fundamental limitation: Transformer attention mechanisms cannot easily attend to "gaps" in documents since these absences don't correspond to any specific keys that can be attended to. Overall, our results and analysis provide a case study of the close proximity of tasks where models are already superhuman (NIAH) and tasks where models breakdown unexpectedly (AbsenceBench).</description>

      <title>Practices that set great software architects apart</title>
      <link>https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/best-practices-of-software-architecture</link>
      <description>Great software architects don’t just make technical decisions—they balance competing priorities, navigate messy org charts, and align engineering with business strategy. This post explores the habits and mindset that separate competent architects from truly impactful ones, and why those differences matter. Whether you're eyeing the role or already in it, these are the practices that move the needle.</description>

      <description>I have pretty extreme water finding gravity behavior. That is, I hate inefficiency. Alternatively, you could call it laziness. But I hate walking so much that it makes me pained to do it and would much rather bike or scooter. This is the root of all my procrastination solving solutions.</description>

      <title>Everything Matters -</title>
      <link>https://jarbus.net/blog/everything-matters/</link>
      <description>Like many edgy teenagers, I once embraced nihilism—the belief that nothing matters, that existence is fundamentally meaningless. I could write a book on how strongly I subscribed to this area of thought, but that’s not the point of this post; you’ll have to trust that the following comes from someone who climbed out of the pit:
Everything matters. And that’s even scarier.
I still don’t believe in broad concepts like “meaning” or “fulfillment”. I believe in biological reactions that make something feel meaningful or fulfilling. Those reactions are what matters, and I think nihilism’s pull is strongest on those who lack them. But we can hack our minds.</description>

      <link>https://computer.rip/2025-06-19-hydronuclear-testing.html</link>
      <description>Some time ago, via a certain orange website, I came across a report about a
mission to recover nuclear material from a former Soviet test
site.
I don't know what you're doing here, go read that instead. But it brought up a
topic that I have only known very little about: Hydronuclear testing.</description>
