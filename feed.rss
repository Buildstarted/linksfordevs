      <title>.NET Rocks! Data Science and UX with Grishma Jena</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1864</link>
      <description>Data Science and UX should be the best of friends! While at the Copenhagen Developer Festival, Carl and Richard talked to Grishma Jena about her work in data science at IBM - and working closely with the UX teams to understand how customers use software and the opportunities to improve it. Grishma talks about the quantitative side of analytics regarding application telemetry, including the ability to predict when a customer is about to abandon an application. The conversation also digs into using modern machine learning to analyze quantitative data, such as comments in surveys - could you sort that kind of data by sentiment or actionability? Improve your UX with data!</description>

      <title>64-Bit Bank Balances ‘Ought to be Enough for Anybody’? | TigerBeetle</title>
      <link>https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/2023-09-19-64-bit-bank-balances-ought-to-be-enough-for-anybody/</link>
      <description>Recently at TigerBeetle,
              we’ve decided
              to use 128-bit integers to store all financial amounts and
              balances, retiring our previous use of 64-bit integers. While some
              may argue that a 64-bit integer, which can store integers ranging
              from zero to 264, is enough to count the
              grains of sand on Earth, we realized we need to go beyond this limit if we want to be
              able to store all kinds of transactions adequately. Let’s
              find out why.</description>

Disclaimer: Prior to writing this article, I have contacted my ex-colleagues at MongoDB to ensure that it does not conflict with their plans. They gave me the green light, provided I send them the draft before publishing, which I did.</description>
