      <title>SQL Server 2019 Tuple Mover Behavior Change</title>
      <link>https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/sql-server-2019-tuple-mover-behavior-change/</link>
      <description>This is a follow-up to my post about an issue with clustered columnstore, when upgrading from SQL Server 2017 to SQL Server 2019. After extensive testing and working with support, I wanted to share some information about a change in SQL Server 2019 that might impact others.
Overview I suggest reading my other post first, it’ll only take a few minutes. I’ll wait…
However, if you really don’t want to read it, here’s a quick recap on the initial issue.</description>

      <description>Who around here hasn’t heard about the tragic and inevitable death of XMPP
(eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)? It’s a pretty common topic in
the community and around, often started by users of XMPP themselves missing a
certain feature in one or multiple specific implementations, or users of
alternative solutions. In a way this is my own version of why XMPP is or isn’t
doomed.</description>

      <link>http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/ingradient-building-the-cooking-tool-ive-always-wanted/</link>
      <description>Years ago, a cooking blog got me thinking about reverse-engineering recipes. I thought I could build an application for that. For those of us privileged enough to contribute, open source software is an endless time sync. I kept putting off the idea for some other shiny pet project–usually JSHint.
With my work on JSHint finally maybe wrapping up, and with a whole lot of extra time due to coronavirus-inspired lifestyle changes, I finally set out to build the thing in March.</description>
