      <title>Arrows born in flight</title>
      <link>https://laenas.github.io/posts/01-fs-primer.html</link>
      <description>My adoption of F# as a language-of-choice was slightly rocky.  After around a decade of nearly exclusive C# work, my curiosity was piqued with an uptick in hearing about this other #-lang.  My initial reaction was one I&amp;#39;ve since seen in other C# developers - dismissal - C# is a good language and I was comfortable with it so why bother with the effort of learning a different one?  But the curiosity remained - and at least a few times I decided I&amp;#39;d set aside an evening to go through a basic introduction post and try to write some katas in F#.  It didn&amp;#39;t stick because I just felt lost and couldn&amp;#39;t translate my experience with C# into feeling even remotely comfortable with F#.  Easy enough to drop the curly braces, a little bit of a hiccup to remember to let instead of var - but how to do what I wanted?</description>

      <description>Writing F# is usually good fun, with an emphasis on writing simple, correct, readable and maintainable code. And since F# runs on top of .NET, it&amp;#39;s usually pretty efficient code as well! However, there are times when you&amp;#39;ll also need to consider compromising on one or two of those qualities in order to eke out…</description>

      <title>Redis Cluster - Benefits of Sharding and How It Works</title>
      <link>https://www.tugberkugurlu.com/archive/redis-cluster-benefits-of-sharding-and-how-it-works</link>
      <description>Redis is one of the good friends of a backend engineer, and its versatility and ease of use make it convenient to get started. That said, when it comes to scaling it horizontally for writes, it gets a bit more tricky with different level of trade-offs you need to make. In this post, I want to touch on the basics of Redis Cluster, out of the box solution of Redis to the gnarly write scaling problem.</description>

      <description>It’s always been a bit of a balancing act to decide which games I write about in detail here — a matter of balancing my level of personal interest in each candidate against its historical importance. In the early years of this project especially, when I still saw it as focusing almost exclusively on narrative-oriented games, I passed over some worthy candidates because I considered them somewhat out of scope. And now, needless to say, I regret some of those omissions.</description>

      <link>https://dandanua.github.io/posts/counterfactual-communication-and-intimidation/</link>
      <description>A few years ago a remarkable event happened. A team of physicists performed an experiment of counterfactual communication. Using the quantum properties of light, they were able to transmit information without sending photon particles to the receiver. This was never performed before or observed in nature. We see objects because reflected photons drop on our retina and start chemical reactions. In optical fibers information is carried by photons that ended up on the receiver side.</description>

      <description>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google&amp;#39;s products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that&amp;#39;s not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it&amp;#39;s a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don&amp;#39;t actually use all of its features, but I&amp;#39;ve migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I&amp;#39;m really happy with it so far.</description>
