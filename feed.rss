      <title>Taking a shortcut: You can query properties from a volume, and it will forward to the physical drive | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201022-00/?p=104391</link>
      <description>If you have the handle to a volume, you can issue certain disk ioctls to the volume, and it will forward them to the underlying disk. We saw this earlier when we used IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER to obtain the physical drive number from a volume.</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 8: Abstract Classes, Interfaces and Error Handling</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj3GJTUaIaQ</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s take a step into object oriented design and listen to Fritz explain abstract classes and interfaces.  We&amp;#39;ll use our newfound knowledge to write error handling and exceptions in our code.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:12:10 - How do you make a new instance of a new generic object?
00:20:34 - Do abstract classes require at least one abstract method?
00:51:58 - Do you have a real world example of implementing interface default implementations?
01:19:37 - When should you throw an exception and when do you return an unsuccessful status?
01:22:01 - Basically Minecraft server uses this type of try / catch block for handling connection errors?

Background Music is Harris Heller&amp;#39;s Streambeats - Synthwave playlist, available royalty free at https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2gj...

      <title>Is Software Contracting For You? - Mischa Spiegelmock</title>
      <link>https://spiegelmock.com/2020/10/20/is-software-contracting-for-you/</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re a full-time employee, becoming a contractor means giving up some job security. You may not have a guaranteed paycheck for a while, if ever. Being a contractor, especially if you&amp;#39;re starting out and doing it alone, brings many uncertainties. However working as a full-time employee carries its own sort of risks. Job security isn&amp;#39;t what it used to be, spending time on bureaucracy and pleasing your superiors may not make you fulfilled, and there&amp;#39;s a real limit to how much you can accomplish for yourself as part of a larger organization.  There is comfort in working at a company; all you have to do is show up and be told what to do, you don&amp;#39;t have to think much about taxes or contracts, someone else can make a lot of the decisions about how to run the company. But if you want to take on more responsibility, have the opportunity to grow and learn to run your own business, and do things your way then consider becoming a contractor. Almost everyone I know who works for a company of any size will be happy to tell you all about the mistakes and boneheaded ideas of their superiors. Everyone has ideas of how the company they work for could be run better. I say if you really believe this then work for yourself.</description>
