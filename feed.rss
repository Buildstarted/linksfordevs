      <title>Frontend performance: React SSR and the Uncanny Valley</title>
      <link>https://crystallize.com/blog/frontend-performance-react-ssr-and-the-uncanny-valley</link>
      <description>Let's say that you just implemented React SSR. After measuring your frontend performance, you're pleased to see that you got a very good pageindex score, but then you notice something else.Shortly after the page is presented, it doesen't seem to work? You have a hard time scrolling and buttons don’t seem to do anything? But if you wait just a bit, a handful seconds or more, suddenly everything works.Congratulations, you've entered the Uncanny Valley.</description>

      <title>Hiring is Broken | Emily Nakashima | Monktoberfest 2018</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=HaMPnpikCfk</link>
      <description>In spite of the best efforts and massive investments of some of the largest and best performing companies in the technology industry, the simple act of hiring remains fundamentally broken. Whether it's hostile and burdensome to candidates or inefficient and counterproductive for employers or both, hiring remains an area of pain for everyone involved. In this Monktoberfest talk, Emily Nakashima discussed how Honeycomb has gone back to the drawing board to completely rethink how they hire, and discussed what their early returns: what's worked, what needs to be improved and where they go from here. If you or your company is hiring technologists, this talk is for you.</description>

      <title>Optimal Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches | Ethan Rosenthal</title>
      <link>https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2020/08/25/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwiches/</link>
      <description>I was personally useless for most of the Spring of 2020. There was a period of time, though, after the peak in coronavirus cases here in NYC and before the onslaught of police violence here in NYC that I managed to scrounge up the motivation to do something other than drink and maniacally refresh my Twitter feed. I set out to work on something completely meaningless. It was almost therapeutic to work on a project with no value of any kind (insert PhD joke here).</description>
