      <title>Gleam is Pragmatic</title>
      <link>https://blog.drewolson.org/gleam-is-pragmatic/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent the past several years working with functional programming languages
in my free time – primarily Haskell and OCaml. I love both languages but also
find aspects of each frustrating.
Haskell is terse and elegant with type classes providing a powerful mechanism
for ad-hoc polymorphism. However, it can also be confusingly implicit and I
personally find lazy evaluation to have more downsides than upsides.
OCaml is explicit and powerful with a best-in-class module system. However, I
believe it is often exhaustingly explicit, especially when dealing with custom
data types in generic containers.</description>

      <title>wrestling the web from corporate control requires making it boring again</title>
      <link>https://washbear.neocities.org/browsers</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s hard to imagine now, but in the 2000s web browsers were quite
boring and didn&amp;#39;t get updated very often. IE7 being released was a huge
deal (indeed, Microsoft kept to a slower-moving schedule just as the
rest of the industry was starting to pick up the pace). Opera was a
viable fully-independent alternative. This all changed with the rise
of the idea of a &amp;quot;Living Standard&amp;quot; (that is to say, a non-standard
of endless layers of constantly-changing complexity for web technology),
and more particularly Google Chrome, which adopted a rapid-release
model right as its authors started having more influence on standards
committees.</description>

      <title>Upwards Pressure on Originality</title>
      <link>https://jarbus.net/blog/upwards-pressure-on-originality/</link>
      <description>It used to be good enough just to copy others. Now, with AI in the hands of billions, there’s little value in copying.
For instance, take programming. Five years ago, building apps, websites, or games required a non-trivial amount of skill, and getting your first project off the ground was an accomplishment. Now, AI can generate most starter projects in hours, if not minutes. I think this decimates the reward, both internal and external, of actually completing the first few projects.</description>
