      <title>PC and Mac with single Mouse and Keyboard Setup on Dual 4k Screens</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Oct/15/PC-and-Mac-with-single-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Setup-on-Dual-4k-Screens</link>
      <description>A little while back I posted a couple of pictures of my new desk setup using both a Windows Laptop (a 2019 Dell XPS) and a Macbook Pro (2016) along with two 4k displays. I&amp;#39;m also using a single Logitech Mouse and Keyboard combination to control both machines and quite a few people were asking about how this works. So I decided to write a quick review of my setup here to give a few more details that are hard to give in a Twitter conversation.</description>

      <title>Personal identifiability of user tracking data during observation of 360-degree VR video</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74486-y#disqus_thread</link>
      <description>Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that is gaining traction in the consumer market. With it comes an unprecedented ability to track body motions. These body motions are diagnostic of personal identity, medical conditions, and mental states. Previous work has focused on the identifiability of body motions in idealized situations in which some action is chosen by the study designer. In contrast, our work tests the identifiability of users under typical VR viewing circumstances, with no specially designed identifying task. Out of a pool of 511 participants, the system identifies 95% of users correctly when trained on less than 5&amp;#160;min of tracking data per person. We argue these results show nonverbal data should be understood by the public and by researchers as personally identifying data.</description>

      <title>Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</title>
      <link>https://mikemcdonald.co/blog/2020/02/17/embrace-extend-extinguish/</link>
      <description>GitHub just released their gh CLI, with initial support for issues and pull requests. While it’s complimentary to git, gh squashes a bunch of otherwise confusing checkout and pull commands and makes the interface much cleaner.
It’s a slick experience that I’m sure will continue to see growth, and at some point gh commands will start making an appearance on GitHub docs and eventually on the main site, for example in the “clone or download” tab on a repo, the default could be gh clone org/repo instead of using git over SSH.</description>

      <title>Solution &amp;amp; Project Structure of a Loosely Coupled Monolith</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1DU9c95ERs</link>
      <description>Here&amp;#39;s how a loosely coupled monolith can be structured in a .NET Solution with C# Projects.  Each boundary is in a solutions folder with 3 projects.  Implementation, Contracts, and Tests.  All of which are class libraries.  The two top level executable projects, AspNetCore and Worker are console applications that reference the implementation projects.

      <title>March 6, 2020 - Minimal March - Building a Blazor CommandButton component on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh7CcVrsX7A</link>
      <description>Fritz works on Blazor components in this stream, adding samples and working on a CommandButton for the BlazorWebFormsComponents.  The Twitch chat room challenges him and the squirrel costume makes another appearance.

Questions:
32:50 - I tried to install IntelliJ on my chrome book.
52:00 -  If it&amp;#39;s an official command, it should have official docs.
1:03:33 - You know the difference between .NET and .NET Core
1:07:57 - It would be nice if cognitive services could turn your documentation into work items and changes to the docs could drive new work items.

      <title>March 5, 2020 - Minimal March - Customizing tmux and Live Coding .NET on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5rb1IwprA</link>
      <description>Tmux is the Terminal Multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems, and allows you to configure your terminal with window panes, additional windows, and navigation between them.  Fritz writes a configuration file today that fits his style of work and add the git status to the tmux status bar.

You can find his tmux configuration on GitHub at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf

Blog post about .NET on a Chromebook: https://jeffreyfritz.com/2020/03/minimal-march-part-2-net-on-a-chromebook/

Questions:
16:30 - If the powerful Chromebooks weren&amp;#39;t so expensive to have a secondary computer I&amp;#39;d get one. 
52:24 - Reload tmux configuration with: Bind R source-file ~/.tmux.config \; display-message &amp;quot;Config reloaded...&amp;quot;
1:02:38 - .NET Core or .NET Framework?
1:45:06 - I have a challenge I&amp;#39;m not sure can easily be met - C# development On an android device.
1:45:41 - I think we can all agree that you can develop on anything, except an iPad.
1:48:50 - VSOnline pricing would be likely put it out of reach for someone who only owns a smartphone and can&amp;#39;t afford a computer.
1:58:50 - Printing to the console is far slower than people realize.
2:20:48 - Could you give me some tips on how to start, what should I learn and use to make my life easier?
2:27:27 - Maybe it&amp;#39;s a good idea to create some Linux already set up for development.

      <title>The Curious Case of Commands and Cancellation</title>
      <link>http://www.roji.org/db-commands-and-cancellation</link>
      <description>Async brought a world of goodness (and complexity) to .NET, including the concept of cancellation: since async operations are by their nature supposed to take a while, it makes sense to allow us to cancel mid-way and exit early. Like async in general, cancellation took some time to propagate everywhere - socket operations only started honoring cancellation token in .NET Core 3.0. For the upcoming 5.0 release of Npgsql, the PostgreSQL database driver, a lot of work is going on to provide a good command cancellation story (thanks @vonzshik!!), and it is far more complicated than you’d think.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201015-00/?p=104369</link>
      <description>Last time, we took a quick look at C++ structured binding. This time, we’ll see how to add structured binding support to your own types. For concreteness, let’s say that we want to make this class available to structured binding: class Person { public:  std::string name;</description>

      <title>February 27, 2020 - Let&amp;#39;s Deploy a Blazor Website to Azure with Containers</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8ilxMfsAHE</link>
      <description>In this stream, Fritz connects Azure DevOps to a GitHub registry and deploys a new container to Azure App Service whenever an update to the BlazorWebFormsComponents samples is made.

View the new website at:  https://blazorwebformscomponents.azurewebsites.net/

17:09 - GitHub &amp;#39;almost works&amp;#39; it&amp;#39;s hit and miss, you may or may not have success with it.
51:21 - Wrote a T4 template that generates constants from that Javascript file. It&amp;#39;s a bit rough but interesting as a proof of concept.
54:33 - T4 = Totally Tubular Template Thing, or something like it, right?
1:450:07 - I&amp;#39;ve never had a good experience with azure dev ops.
1:52:20 - YAML is the 7th circle of hell.
2:29:50 - Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can delete a version of a private package in that repository.

      <description>When Stripe announced earlier this year that it had picked up another $600 million in funding, it said one big reason for the funding was to expand its API-based payments services into more geographies. Today the company is coming good on that plan in the form of some M&amp;amp;A. Stripe is acquiring P…</description>

      <title>March 4, 2020 - Minimal March - Live Coding .NET on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7kUuQsyGnw</link>
      <description>Minimal March continues with Fritz working with .NET Core and C# on a Chromebook.  Today he&amp;#39;s talking about how he bricked and rebuilt the Chromebook after the last episode.  We build some scripts to automate builds and tests for the project, and Fritz even installs Visual Studio Code on the Chromebook and shows how easy it is to get productive with minimal hardware.

Questions:
12:17 - There were incidents where fonts were used to inject viruses into operating systems. Maybe that is why they are protecting it a bit.
 23:23 - If you&amp;#39;re trying to see if it&amp;#39;s for you, spending 1000$ instead of 50$ isn&amp;#39;t reasonable, especially if you don&amp;#39;t have 1000$.
23:44 - When I teach people I try to ease the environment burden as much as possible. 
24:39 - Make it easy for newcomers to fall into the pit of success.
24:51 - I really wish Apple would open their ecosystem. I&amp;#39;d love to write something for an iPhone without having a mac.
1:08:48 - Have you considered the pi4 4gb?
1:10:40 - What are good resources you might suggest for learning about keeping things consistent and synchronized in a space where multiple instances of the web application are running and you might post to a different server than you got from?
1:16:00 - The customer reserves a specific unit, but if the eventual consistency then it might already be reserved?
1:22:36 - Which Linux distribution would you recommend for developing ASP.NET CORE projects?
1:55:50 - What is Omnisharp?
