      <link>https://linusakesson.net/scene/a-mind-is-born/</link>
      <description>Making a demo in just 256 bytes would be a formidable challenge
regardless of platform. A&amp;#160;Mind&amp;#160;Is&amp;#160;Born is my attempt to do it
on the Commodore&amp;#160;64. In the absence of an actual 256-byte compo, it was
submitted to the Oldskool&amp;#160;4K&amp;#160;Intro compo at Revision&amp;#160;2017, where it ended
up on 1st place.</description>

      <description>We’re reaching the end of this series on records as strongly-typed ids. Sorry for the long delay since the last post… life happened! So far we’ve covered ASP.NET Core model binding, JSON serialization, and EF Core integration. Almost everything is working, we just need to fix a few more details.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210319-00/?p=104979</link>
      <description>Last time, we tried to make an awaitable shared mutex, but ran into some problems. The first problem was that shared locks can starve out exclusive locks. To fix that, we say that you cannot steal the lock if there is already anybody waiting.</description>

      <link>https://dariagrudzien.com/posts/skin-in-the-game-of-software-development/</link>
      <description>Or The Agency Problem Within Engineering Teams.
 A while back I decided it’s time for a change and went to find my second engineering adventure. As I’ve been enjoying a month off in between the jobs and subjecting myself to the brain dump of Nassim Taleb’s Skin In The Game I realized there’s one main learning I got both out of the job hunt and my first job:</description>

      <description>The truly weird thing is that Justin Long was always pitching for Intel-based computers, at least indirectly, in the “Get a Mac” campaign, the introduction of which coincided with the start of the Intel Mac era: 2006-2009.</description>

      <title>Who&amp;#39;s the Best Engineer You&amp;#39;ve Worked With?</title>
      <link>https://des.wtf/whos-the-best-engineer-youve-worked-with/</link>
      <description>I ask this question in every interview I have with someone who has at least as
much experience as I do. I ask this when I’m interviewing job candidates and
also when I’m the one applying for a new position. I don’t really care about
what that engineer’s name is or where they worked. I ask this question because
it seems to be unheard of enough that most don’t have a canned response and it
consistently spurs insightful conversation.</description>

      <description>I love my Peloton. Mostly it exists as a fancy piece of abstract art in my office, but I occasionally use it for workouts. When I overcome my lazy butt inertia, my experience is that the Peloton almost always wants to do an update.</description>

      <title>MySQL from Below</title>
      <link>https://blog.koehntopp.info/2021/02/25/mysql-from-below.html</link>
      <description>When you insert data into a database and run COMMIT you expect things to be there: Atomically, Consistent, Isolated and Durable, like Codd commanded us 40 years ago, but also quickly. There is a surprising amount of sophistication being poured into this, but since I do not want to shame MongoDB and Redis developers in this post, I am not going to talk about that much in this place.</description>

      <title>Can we talk about client-side certificates?</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/06/12/Can-we-talk-about-client-side-certs.html</link>
      <description>I’m working on improving the means by which API users authenticate with the
SourceHut API. Today, I was reading RFC 6749 (OAuth2) for this purpose,
and it got me thinking about the original OAuth spec. I recalled vaguely that it
had the API clients actually sign every request, and… yep, indeed it
does. This also got me thinking: what else signs requests? TLS!</description>

      <description>As modern application environments are polyglot, distributed, and increasingly complex, observing your application to identify and react to failures has become challenging. In early 2019, two popular instrumentation projects, OpenTracing and OpenCensus, merged to create OpenTelemetry, a new standard for observability telemetry.</description>
