      <title>Asking nicely for root command execution (and getting it)</title>
      <link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/08/17/pop/</link>
      <description>There was a SEV review meeting once upon a time, and in it, we had 
reviewed some incident where something bad happened involving something 
that ran as root.  I don&amp;#39;t remember the finer points of that one any 
more, but the resident VP who ran the show wondered aloud how much 
&amp;quot;root exposure&amp;quot; we had in our infra in general.  That got my attention.</description>

      <title>More. Helvetica. Now.</title>
      <link>https://www.monotype.com/fonts/helvetica-now-variable</link>
      <description>Helvetica Now Variable gives you over a million new Helvetica styles in one state-of-the-art font file (over two-and-a-half million with italics!). Use it as an extension of the Helvetica Now family or make custom-blends from its weights (Hairline to ExtraBlack), optical sizes (four point to infinity), and new Compressed and Condensed widths.</description>

      <title>How good is Codex?</title>
      <link>https://smitop.com/post/codex/</link>
      <description>OpenAI recently released Codex (paper), a large-scale language generation model trained on public programming source code from GitHub. Its most prominent use so far is GitHub Copilot, which is an extension for VSCode1 that autocompletes code being edited. However, there are many uses for Codex beyond code completion. OpenAI recently ran the OpenAI Codex Challenge, where competitors were tasked with solving various programming tasks, and could use Codex to help them. I participated in the challenge and got 75th place2. Due to some overloaded servers during the challenge, many people were unable to actually do actually compete, so that ranking is mostly due to me figuring out the best times to reload to get the challenge to work. After the challenge, OpenAI sent me an invite to try out the Codex model, which I used to do the testing in the post.</description>

      <title>Computers Are Bad</title>
      <link>https://computer.rip/2021-08-16-on-voting.html</link>
      <description>The use of electronics to administer elections has been controversial for some
time. Since the &amp;quot;hanging chads&amp;quot; of the 2000 election, there&amp;#39;s been some degree
of public awareness of the use of technology for voting and its possible
impacts on the accuracy and integrity of the election. The exact nature of the
controversy has been through several generations, though, reflecting both
changes in election technology and changes in the political climate.</description>
