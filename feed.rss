      <title>A Taste of GPU Compute</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqkAaplKBc4</link>
      <description>Presented by: Raph Levien

The GPU in a modern computer (desktop or mobile) has about an order of magnitude more raw general purpose computing throughput than the CPU, but is barely used except for games, machine learning, and cryptocurrency mining, largely because it’s hard to program. Getting good performance entails massive parallelism (thousands of threads) and careful attention to an explicit memory hierarchy. While GPU compute programming may seem to many like a black art, techniques from functional programming, including immutable data structures and an emphasis on associative operations (monoids) adapt very well to this space. This talk will present techniques used in piet-metal, a new 2D graphics rendering engine optimized for the modern GPU compute, and hopefully will serve as an invitation for the curious to explore this strange but powerful computing environment.

Raph Levien is currently an independent researcher exploring 2D graphics, font technology, and GUI, doing most of his work in Rust. Previously he was at Google for 11 years, including on the Android UI toolkit team, mostly working on fonts and text, and before that was the maintainer of Ghostscript. He has a PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, on the topic of curve design tools.</description>

      <title>Is BGP safe yet? · Cloudflare</title>
      <link>https://isbgpsafeyet.com/</link>
      <description>On the Internet, network devices exchange routes via a protocol called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Unfortunately, issues with BGP have led to malicious actors being able to hijack and misconfigure devices leading to security problems which have the potential to cause widespread problems. BGP security can be greatly improved by using technologies such as RPKI to sign Internet routes. This page attempts to track the progress of major Internet players (ISPs, transit operators, and content providers) in their progress to adopt RPKI and other technologies.</description>

      <title>How I made a basketball hoop that always goes in</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA</link>
      <description>I've wondered if it is possible to make a basketball hoop where the ball always goes in. Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often. In this video I show how I wrote a program to calculate the optical backboard then machined and fabricated it. It worked out better than I was expected so I'm really happy with it!

*Sorry for the re-upload to anyone who saw the first one. I made a major rookie mistake and uploaded the wrong file. yikes! Lesson learned.*

      <description>Over the last few months I have been trying to push my understanding of Physically Based Shading, by actively exploring every corner and turning over every stone, to uncover any area where I lack knowledge. Although this is still an ongoing process and I still have a lot to do, I thought I could already share some of what I have learned in the process.</description>

      <description>Originally streamed at https://twitch.tv/davidwengier

In this episode we finish off drawing on a HTML canvas and hook up some mouse events, only to be hit by the brick wall of terrible performance with interop between .NET running on WASM and trying to call JavaScript in the browser. Technically it works, just not very well 😀</description>
