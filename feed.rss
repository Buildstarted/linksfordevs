      <title>| Meritocracy vs TopocracyMichele Coscia</title>
      <link>https://www.michelecoscia.com/?p=2205</link>
      <description>The world isn’t always fair. Perhaps you know the frustration of pouring your heart into making something extraordinary, only to see it almost completely ignored by the crowd. On the other hand, celebrities are constantly talked about, even when they are ostensibly doing very little — if anything at all. Your clever lyrics and innovative musical composition lie in the obscure shadow of a pop idol singing “let’s go party” over the same riff used by dozens of clones. Is it just you, or is there an actual force causing this to happen? This is an interesting question I decided to study together with Clara Vandeweerdt.</description>

      <title>The Lens Of Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://blog.kerryjones.net/posts/the-lens-of-asymmetry/</link>
      <description>The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) claims that if an investor wants higher rewards they must take greater risk. This belief in the symmetry of the public market is one of the pillars of EMH. The idea that you can find an investment that is low-risk and high-reward, on the other hand, would be asymmetrical.</description>

      <title>Understanding Styles in XAML based Applications - Nick&amp;#39;s .NET Travels</title>
      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/xaml-button-styles/</link>
      <description>One of the questions that came up recently was how to make what appears to be a simple change to a Button – change the background colour of the Button to Red when it’s disabled.

      <title>Ken Thompson Really Did Launch His &amp;quot;Trusting Trust&amp;quot; Trojan Attack in Real Life</title>

      <description>Ken Thompson&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Trusting Trust&amp;quot; compiler Trojan attack was not just a thought experiment. In fact, Usenet poster Jay Ashworth stated that, from personal communications, Thompson really did launch this attack in real life and successfully compromised the Unix Support Group at Bell Labs. Recently, I&amp;#39;ve rediscovered this original message with full message headers in a search effort using various Usenet archives, showing the authenticity of the post.</description>

      <title>Dear Console,… | Christian Heilmann</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2022/09/29/dear-console/</link>
      <description>The browser developer tools Console is so much more than a place to log your messages. It is a way for you to programatically access the currently shown document and window, read out values and change them. On top of that, it has a powerful API of helper methods to make that easier than with vanilla JavaScript.</description>
