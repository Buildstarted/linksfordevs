Just a note: when the total for the M4 Mini shows $2598, I have Final Cut in the cart, so the actual machine price is $2399 at that point.</description>

      <title>LIVE CODING - WordPress Migration to Blazor - PART 5</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=uEd7Lhza3P4</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s time! WordPress on AWS LightSail has been non-stop problems for nearly 2 years now.

Time for a change.

I&amp;#39;ll be looking into using LinkDotNet.Blog by Steven Giesel as my blog engine of choice. But migrations are never easy, so this will be the first of many sessions trying to figure out how I can get my blog setup before going live.

Remember -- I need to keep as many links active as possible so I don&amp;#39;t ruin my SEO!

Hey everyone! Today we&amp;#39;re diving into something that&amp;#39;s going to make your life WAY easier if you&amp;#39;re building distributed applications in .NET. We&amp;#39;re looking at the new service discovery capabilities that came out of the .NET Aspire project.

If you&amp;#39;ve ever dealt with hardcoded service URLs or struggled with service discovery in your microservices, this video is for you. I&amp;#39;ll show you how to implement service discovery in your .NET applications using a simple NuGet package that makes everything just... work.

We&amp;#39;ll cover:
- Setting up service discovery in your .NET app
- Configuring the reverse proxy
- Making services discoverable
- Best practices and common pitfalls

No complicated configurations, no complex setup - just straightforward, practical service discovery that you can implement today. Whether you&amp;#39;re new to microservices or a seasoned developer, you&amp;#39;ll find something valuable here.

      <title>What Is .NET Aspire and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Cyb4OFhQbI</link>
      <description>Heard about .NET Aspire but have no clue what it is, and what it can do for you? Let me show you exactly what you have been missing out on!

Don’t let all the buzzwords scare you. It’s a lot easier than it may sound. Throughout this video we will explore the different parts of what makes .NET Aspire. How do you make it easier for a web frontend to discover an API? How do you easily add a Redis cache to an application, or any arbitrary docker container for that matter?

No matter if you can figure out how to get a complex solution running locally, making this process easier will save both time and money. 

.NET Aspire is really just a tool to make development easier. By providing a set of opinionated decisions, to introduce open telemetry, service discovery, http client configurations, and much more. All of this to make it a lot easier to run complex, and easy, solutions. Locally, or in the cloud! 

At the end of this video, we will take it one step further from local development to get the entire stack published to the cloud, without a lot of work at all!

Without further ado, let’s learn about .NET Aspire!

      <title>Talking to managers about modernizing .NET apps</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=hn2nEKquSOE</link>
      <description>Most developers understand the benefits of migrating legacy apps to the new .NET and the risks of not doing so. Sadly, it is usually not the developers who decide whether these old .NET Framework applications will be modernized or not. How do you convince the management to allocate the budget for this task? What arguments and information should you present to stakeholders who do not have a technical background to ensure they understand the situation? In this session, I&amp;#39;ll provide valuable tips and arguments I used in the past to advocate the necessity of modernization in various companies. I&amp;#39;ll talk about estimating the effort of modernization and the long-term maintenance costs. I&amp;#39;ll also go through the security risks and other benefits of the upgrade, such as improving the project&amp;#39;s attractiveness for hiring new developers.
