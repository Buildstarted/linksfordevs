      <title>Having Fun With a Scamming Crypto Job</title>
      <link>https://nguyenhuythanh.com/posts/having-fun-with-a-scamming-crypto-job/</link>
      <description>I‚Äôm going to cover what happened and the technical details of a crypto job scam that I‚Äôve avoided. Let‚Äôs hope that it can be both entertaining and informative.
It‚Äôs my second time encoutering this kind of scam. In the first time, I just ignored it as the sign is too obvious: a non-fitting job (frontend heavy job for a backend guy) where the recruiter is ‚Äúimpressed with my technical skills‚Äù and think that I‚Äôm ‚Äúan exellent fit‚Äù.</description>

      <title>Mastodon Exit Interview</title>
      <link>https://v.cx/2025/04/mastodon-exit-interview</link>
      <description>I am currently winding down the Mastodon bots I used to post sunrise and sunset times. The precipitating event is that the admin of the instance hosting the associated accounts demanded they be made nigh-undiscoverable, but the underlying cause is that it‚Äôs become increasing clear that Mastodon isn‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt ever be, a good platform for ‚Äúasynchronous ephemeral notifications of any kind‚Äù. I‚Äôd also argue (more controversially) that it‚Äôs simply not good infrastructure for social networking of any kind. There are lots of interesting people using Mastodon, and I‚Äôm sure it will live on as a good-enough space for certain niche groups. But there is no question that it will never offer the fun of early Twitter, let alone the vibrancy of Twitter during its growth phase. I‚Äôve long since dropped Mastodon from my home screen, and have switched to Bluesky for text-centric social media.</description>

      <title>The Secret To Planning An Impactful Conference Talk!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=QRdgew4QXtQ</link>
      <description>Ever sat through a conference talk wondering "Why should I care?" or "What's in it for me?" You're not alone. In this video, I'll reveal the secret that most speakers miss when planning their talks, and how you can avoid this common pitfall.

Hi, I'm James, a storytelling technologist who's delivered talks worldwide. I'm about to share the #1 most crucial principle that will transform your presentations from self-centered to audience-captivating.

What You'll Learn:
- The fundamental truth about who the REAL hero of your talk should be (hint: it's not you)
- Why even the most brilliant technical content fails without this key element
- How to instantly connect with your audience by addressing their specific pain points
- The difference between generic industry talk and compelling personal storytelling
- My proven template for planning audience-centered presentations

I'll demonstrate this principle through contrasting examples of conference openings and share a behind-the-scenes look at my own talk planning process.
