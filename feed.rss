      <title>Coding Shorts: Changes to Coming to Startup in .NET 6 
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2021/08/04/Coding-Shorts-Changes-to-Coming-to-Startup-in--NET-6/</link>
      <description>.NET 6 Preview 6 is here. One of the big changes I&amp;#39;m looking forward to is how startup is changing. With this change, comes &amp;quot;Minimal APIs&amp;quot; too. While getting rid of the Startup class is a welcome change, I&amp;#39;m a little less excited about how Minimal APIs might be over-used.

      <description>The Windows Runtime has this thing called “static classes”. What are they? A static Windows Runtime class is a class that has no instances. An example of this is the FileIO class: static runtimeclass FileIO {   static IAsyncOperation&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; ReadTextAsync(IStorageFile file);   static IAsyncAction WriteText(IStorageFile file,</description>

      <title>Coding Shorts: Dependency Injection Explained
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2021/07/05/Coding-Shorts-Dependency-Injection-Explained/</link>
      <description>Like most of you, I&amp;#39;ve been using Dependency Injection in my projects for quite a while. Whether it be the built-in .NET Core Dependency Injection layer, Ninject, StructureMap, Unity, MEF, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been using a DI layer to do this work for many years. But before I understood the benefit, I did so somewhat reluctantly.

      <title>An Attempt at Demystifying Graph Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/machine-learning/graph-nets/</link>
      <description>There are a ton of great explainers of what graph neural networks are.
However, I find that a lot of them go pretty deep into the math pretty quickly.
Yet, we still are faced with that age-old problem: where are all the pics??
As such, just as I had attempted with Bayesian deep learning,
I&amp;#39;d like to try to demystify graph deep learning as well,
using every tool I have at my disposal
to minimize the number of equations and maximize intuition using pictures.
Here&amp;#39;s my attempt, I hope you find it useful!</description>
