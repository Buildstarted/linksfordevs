      <description>I&amp;#39;m used to seeing large amounts of personal data left inadvertently exposed to the web. Recently, the Red Cross Blood Service down here left a huge amount of data exposed (well, at least the company doing their tech things did). Shortly afterwards, the global recruitment company Michael Page also lost</description>

Lyrics:
Do you believe in magic in a young girl&amp;#39;s heart
How the music can free her whenever it starts?
And it&amp;#39;s magic if the music is groovy
It makes you feel happy like an old-time movie
I&amp;#39;ll tell you about the magic, and it&amp;#39;ll free your soul
But it&amp;#39;s like tryna tell a stranger &amp;#39;bout-a rock and roll

If you believe in magic, don&amp;#39;t bother to choose
If it&amp;#39;s jug band music or rhythm and blues
Just go and listen, and it&amp;#39;ll start with a smile
That won&amp;#39;t wipe off your face no matter how hard you try
Your feet start tapping, and you can&amp;#39;t seem to find
How you got there so just blow your mind

If you believe in magic, come along with me
We&amp;#39;ll dance until morning till there&amp;#39;s just you and me
And maybe, if the music is right
I&amp;#39;ll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night
And we&amp;#39;ll go dancing, baby, then you&amp;#39;ll see
How the magic&amp;#39;s in the music and the music&amp;#39;s in me

Yeah
Do you believe in magic?
Yeah
Believe in the magic of the young girl&amp;#39;s soul
Believe in the magic of-a rock and roll
Believe in the magic that can set you free
Ohh, talking &amp;#39;bout the magic

      <title>Memory Safe ‘curl’ for a More Secure Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/memory-safe-curl/</link>
      <description>Memory safety vulnerabilities represent one of the biggest threats to Internet security. As such, we at ISRG are interested in finding ways to make the most heavily relied-upon software on the Internet memory safe. Today we’re excited to announce that we’re working with Daniel Stenberg, author of ubiquitous curl software, and WolfSSL, to make critical parts of the curl codebase memory safe.
ISRG is funding Daniel to work on adding support for Hyper as an HTTP back-end for curl.</description>

      <title>If Worker Pay Had Kept Pace With Productivity Gains Since 1968, Today&amp;#39;s Minimum Wage Would Be $24 an Hour</title>
      <link>https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24</link>
      <description>In such a world, a full-time minimum wage worker would be earning $48,000 a year in the United States... If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12 an hour today, more than 65 percent higher than the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While this would make a huge difference in the lives of many people earning close to the national minimum wage, it is actually a relatively unambitious target.</description>
