      <title>Tarsnap has given 2^18 dollars to open source</title>
      <link>https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</link>
      <description>Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
&amp;quot;We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers&amp;quot;, and it made me wonder
just how much Tarsnap had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
December 2009
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren&amp;#39;t limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the &amp;quot;budget&amp;quot; to the
FreeBSD Foundation.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.</description>
