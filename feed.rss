      <title>MAP_SHARED and RSS/SHR</title>
      <link>https://jack.culhane.ie/posts/mmap_shr_memory/</link>
      <description>Recently we were debugging a memory leak on an experimental debugging branch.
It turned out to be a false alarm due to adding tokio-console to a component to debug something.
However, while investigating we noticed a higher than expected RES / SHR reported by htop on another server, that was not on the tokio console branch.
We were using shared memory / mmap queues for communicating between two processes.
These mmaps are reported in RSS (resident set size) and also in SHR (shared memory).</description>

      <description>While it is true that most of the time while developing software, we just pick either C++, Java, Python, etc. and start coding simply because A these languages are already well-established and have a lot of libraries and B we are already familiar with them. Yet new languages still emerge from time to time, such as Rust, TypeScript, and Julia, which are happliy adopted (and hated) by developers. But few have thought about what are we actually creating.</description>
