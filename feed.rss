      <title>Double-Odd Elliptic Curves - Double-Odd Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://doubleodd.group/</link>
      <description>Double-odd elliptic curves are a large subset of elliptic curves: these
are curves whose order is equal to 2 modulo 4 (i.e. the order is the
double of an odd integer). On top of double-odd elliptic curves, we can
define a prime order group suitable for building cryptographic
protocols. This is similar to what Ristretto
achieves for twisted Edwards curves, albeit with a different method.
Some highlights of double-odd elliptic curves are:</description>

      <title>Brave Browser leaks your Tor / Onion service requests through DNS.</title>
      <link>https://ramble.pw/f/privacy/2387/brave-browser-leaks-your-tor-onion-service-requests-through</link>
      <description>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I&amp;#39;m not trying to shit on Brave. I&amp;#39;m just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it&amp;#39;s Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you&amp;#39;re using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that you made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</description>
