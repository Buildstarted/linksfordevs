      <description>We live in a time where a 15-year-old kid can earn more money in six months of selling cartoon monkey pictures online than a carpenter can make in a lifetime of building houses. How is this possible?</description>

      <title>Type You An Actor Runtime For Greater Good! (with Java 17, records, switch expressions and JBang)</title>
      <link>https://evacchi.github.io/java/records/jbang/2022/02/13/type-you-an-actor-runtime-java-17-switch-expressions.html</link>
      <description>This blog post was originally published at the Java Advent Calendar 2021, so pardon all the festive references. San Biagio was just a few days ago, but if that really bothers you, you can mentally replace all references to Panettone with Tortelli alla crema e chiacchiere di Carnevale.</description>

      <title>What does it mean to listen on a port?</title>

      <description>This story explores some concepts in computer networking, inspired by Michael Nielsen’s idea of discovery fiction. Code samples can also be found in this repo. Excerpts use openbsd-flavoured netcat on Debian Linux; behviour and IPv6 support may vary by version.</description>

      <title>Implementing Basic Authentication in ASP.NET Core Minimal API</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/implementing-basic-authentication-in-minimal-webapi/</link>
      <description>This post is about how implement basic authentication in ASP.NET Core Minimal API. Few days back I got a question / comment in the blog post about Minimal APIs - about implementing Basic authentication in Minimal APIs. Since the Action Filters support is not available in Minimal API I had to find some alternative approach for the implementation. I already wrote two blog posts Basic authentication middleware for ASP.NET 5 and Basic HTTP authentication in ASP.Net Web API on implementing Basic authentication. In this post I am implementing an AuthenticationHandler and using this for implementing basic authentication. As I already explained enough about the concepts, I am not discussing them again in this post.</description>

      <title>Angular Server Side Rendering on Azure Static Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/angular-server-side-rendering-azure-static-webapps/</link>
      <description>This post is about how implement Angular Server side rendering apps on Azure Static Web Apps. What is server-side rendering - A normal Angular application executes within the browser, rendering pages within the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the consumer. This implies that the appliance usually renders additional quickly, giving users an opportunity to look at the appliance layout before it becomes totally interactive.</description>
