      <title>MAPS.ME is gone. We must bring it back.</title>
      <link>https://telegra.ph/What-happened-to-the-old-MAPSME-12-20</link>
      <description>TL;DR: MAPS.ME got bought by a payments company and completely rewritten, I want it back. I will rebuild the original app and bring it back. Sign up for this email list to get the original version back. Or subscribe to this Telegram channel.
On December 20th, 2020, version 2.0 of the MAPS.ME app got pushed to the Apple App Store. It is expected to land on Android in the coming days.
This is due to the app being sold off to a South Korean payments company.
What changed?

      <title>C# 9 records as strongly-typed ids - Part 4: Entity Framework Core integration</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/12/23/csharp-9-records-as-strongly-typed-ids-part-4-entity-framework-core-integration/</link>
      <description>So far in this series, I showed how to use C# 9 records to declare strongly-typed ids as easily as this:
public record ProductId(int Value) : StronglyTypedId&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(Value); I also explained how to make them work correctly with ASP.NET Core model binding and JSON serialization.
Today, I’ll present another piece of the puzzle: how to make Entity Framework core handle strongly-typed ids correctly.
Value conversion for a specific strongly-typed id Out of the box, EF Core doesn’t know anything about our strongly-typed ids.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum computing with Q# – Part 11, EPR Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2020/12/introduction-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-11-epr-quantum-key-distribution/</link>
      <description>In the last two posts we covered quantum key exchange using the B92 and BB84 protocols. Both of those depended with their security on the no-cloning theorem. Today we are going to dedicate a third post to the topic of quantum key distribution, and this time around we will explore a variant of key distribution relying on the phenomenon of entanglement and quantum correlations.</description>
