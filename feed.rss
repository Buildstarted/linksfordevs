      <title>Threat modeling: PhaaS, platform abuses, and content moderation</title>
      <link>https://gubello.me/blog/threat-model-phaas-platform-abuses/</link>
      <description> ❗️Disclosure: I work at Pitch since December 2021. This write-up aggregates public knowledge previously shared by third parties (e.g., security firms, infosec community, etc.) or us. I hope this can be helpful for younger security teams that need to understand how to identify and mitigate phishing abuses for the first time.
Threat model When you work in the startup ecosystem long enough, you learn that company cybersecurity risks are not only related to IT failures or the OWASP Top 10 but also to reputation. It doesn’t matter if your infrastructure is solid and redundant, if your engineers follow best practices, if you have real-time monitors and alerts in place, or if you implement other good practices: if stakeholders don’t trust your security standards, you are not secure in their eyes. This is why startups and companies invest money and time into security certifications like ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type 2 (though this is a controversial topic, and I have strong opinions on it, I won’t delve into that now).</description>

      <title>Multi-Agents Are Out, PID Controllers Are In</title>
      <link>https://timkellogg.me/blog/2025/03/06/pid-controllers</link>
      <description>My hottest take is that multi-agents are a broken concept and should be avoided at all cost. My only caveat is PID controllers; A multi agent system that does a 3-step process that looks something like **Plan, Act, Verify** in a loop. That can work. Everything else is a devious plan to sell dev tools.</description>

      <title>LADDER: Self-Improving LLMs Through Recursive Problem Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00735</link>
      <description>We introduce LADDER (Learning through Autonomous Difficulty-Driven Example Recursion), a framework which enables Large Language Models to autonomously improve their problem-solving capabilities through self-guided learning by recursively generating and solving progressively simpler variants of complex problems. Unlike prior approaches that require curated datasets or human feedback, LADDER leverages a model&amp;#39;s own capabilities to generate easier question variants. We demonstrate LADDER&amp;#39;s effectiveness in the subject of mathematical integration, improving Llama 3.2 3B&amp;#39;s accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level problems and enabling Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve 73% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination. We also introduce TTRL (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning), where we perform reinforcement learning on variants of test problems at inference time. TTRL enables Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled to achieve a state-of-the-art score of 90% on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1&amp;#39;s performance. These results show how self-directed strategic learning can achieve significant capability improvements without relying on architectural scaling or human supervision.</description>

      <title>A Quick Journey Into the Linux Kernel | Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.lucavall.in/blog/a-quick-journey-into-the-linux-kernel</link>
      <description>I recently took a deep dive into the Linux kernel to understand how it handles processes, scheduling, memory, and more. While I had some OS knowledge from school, it always felt too abstract - so I wanted to see how things actually work. This post covers what I learned, from system calls to interrupts, and how kernel development differs from userspace.</description>

      <title>Metaprogramming Made Accessible: Gael Fraiteur Explores the World of Metalama</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JJxHBNeqpAU</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;And I think this is really the key factor in software development. I think it&amp;#39;s really to keep complexity low, because in most projects, unless you are writing an operating system, a framework or rocket navigation you are not coding against hardware; like the hardware is not your bottleneck. You are coding against human brains, cognitive abilities of your team; like how many smart people your company is able to put on your team, this is your limiting factor so we need to keep complexity low and I think it&amp;#39;s really the most important benefit.&amp;quot;— Gael Fraiteur

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I&amp;#39;m Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.

 In this episode, Gael Fraiteur joined us to talk about Metaprogramming with Metalama. Gael is the original author of the wildly successful PostSharp and has been working with the aspect-oriented programming pattern for over 20 years. In this conversation we talk about how metaprogramming (regardless of whether you use Metalama to achieve that or not) can save on both the complexity and the number lines of code in your projects.

 &amp;quot;Well, there are studies that try to correlate the cost of software projects to the number of lines of code. And the conclusion is: it is more or less a linear dependency. A bit super linear. That means that if you have 15% fewer lines of code, you are going to get 15% lower development cost. So that&amp;#39;s the easiest part&amp;quot;— Gael Fraiteur

      <title>How to Show and Hide the Keyboard in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/how-to-show-and-hide-the-keyboard-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>As I always say, the more control we have over how elements behave in our apps, the better experience we can provide to users.
In this article, we’ll explore an interesting feature of the virtual keyboard: how to show or hide it strategically to improve usability. With .NET MAUI, you can achieve this easily in just a few steps. Let’s dive in! &amp;#128640;




Let&amp;#39;s get started! &amp;#128640;
The first thing you should know when you hear or read about the term soft input keyboard is that it refers to the virtual keyboard that appears on the screen when entering text.

What are SoftInputExtensions?
In .NET MAUI, several UI elements, such as Entry and Editor, accept text input and automatically interact with the soft input keyboard. With SoftInputExtensions, we can take full control of its visibility using extension methods, allowing us to easily show or hide the keyboard as needed.

SoftInputExtensions Methods
The SoftInputExtensions class provides the following methods:
&amp;#128313; HideSoftInputAsync – Hides the soft input keyboard if it is currently visible.
&amp;#128313; ShowSoftInputAsync – Displays the soft input keyboard if it is currently hidden.
&amp;#128313; IsSoftInputShowing – Returns a boolean value indicating whether the soft input keyboard is currently displayed on the screen. - ✍️ I recommend using this method before deciding whether to show or hide the soft input keyboard.

How to implement it
