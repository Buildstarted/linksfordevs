      <title>Why I (still) love Vaadin</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/why-love-vaadin/</link>
      <description>It’s funny how things come in sequences. Recently, on three separate occasions, I stumbled upon questions asking what people used for front-end technologies. Every time, my answer was Vaadin. Unfortunately, some places, e.g. Twitter, are too limiting to explain my answer in depth. In this blog, I’ve no such limitations. In one sentence, Vaadin is a framework to create GUI using plain Java, or any JVM-based language for that matter. One develop in Java, and the framework takes care o</description>

      <title>Faster than radix sort: Kirkpatrick-Reisch sorting</title>
      <link>https://sortingsearching.com/2020/06/06/kirkpatrick-reisch.html</link>
      <description>Radix sort sorts n w-bit integers by splitting them up into chunks of log⁡n\log nlogn bits each, and sorting each chunk in linear time. Thus it achieves O(nw/log⁡n)O(nw/\log n)O(nw/logn) time.</description>

      <title>Gearing up your development environment with IPv6 Prefix Delegation - fnordahl.com</title>
      <link>https://fnordahl.com/2020/06/07/gearing-up-your-development-environment-with-ipv6-prefix-delegation/</link>
      <description>A while back I moved to a house where there was no wired infrastructure
available. The national incumbent had turned off the signals on the old copper
wires long ago without offering any alternatives. A mobile broadband provider
has been the rescue, and while they have provided a service reliable as shared
and wireless services can be, their lack of investment in technology has been
what has bothered me the most. The most prominent effect of the lack of
technology investment was no IPv6 support, which for a communication service
provider is a sure way to paint yourself into a corner.</description>

      <title>The Weaponization of Diversity - Silicon Hills Lawyer</title>

      <description>This is an unusually lengthy essay, because the issue is so complex and nuanced that it deserves an appropriate level of patience and attention. It includes my deeply honest, personal, and some would say risky perspective on the topic of diversity in high-performance careers, including tech entrepreneurship; and my concern that the decision by some […]</description>

      <title>Code Review and Criticism · Caffeinspiration</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/me-and-my-work/</link>
      <description>I’ve been working in software for a few years, and I’ve come to take it for granted that I am not my work. My work exists in some separate sphere, where it can easily be critiqued, dissected, refactored, or improved by me or anyone else. It’s as if it’s in a separate pond from my private one, where any ripples don’t cross the pebbly barrier to the rest of me. I’m still proud of the things I make and still take ownership over code, projects, and problems, but those things are separate from me.</description>
