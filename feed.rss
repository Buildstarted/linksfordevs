For those who don&amp;amp;rsquo;t know that is the DMA, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s a new law that the European Parliament voted on recently and one of its goals of it is to force some interoperability between messaging services by allowing small players to able to communicate with users from the so-called Gatekeepers (e.</description>

      <title>How I made banditypes, the smallest TS validation library</title>
      <link>https://blog.thoughtspile.tech/2023/03/02/banditypes-smallest-validation/</link>
      <description>I open-sourced banditypes — the smallest runtime validation library for TS / JS. It manages to fit all the basic functionality into an astounding 400 bytes. For reference, the popular zod and yup libraries are around 11KB, superstruct measures 1.8KB for the same set of functionality.</description>

      <title>Journey Through Freedreno</title>
      <link>https://fryzekconcepts.com/notes/freedreno_journey.html</link>
      <description>As part of my training at Igalia I’ve been attempting to write a new backend for Freedreno that targets the proprietary “KGSL” kernel mode driver. For those unaware there are two “main” kernel mode drivers on Qualcomm SOCs for the GPU, there is the “MSM”, and “KGSL”. “MSM” is DRM compliant, and Freedreno already able to run on this driver. “KGSL” is the proprietary KMD that Qualcomm’s proprietary userspace driver targets. Now why would you want to run freedreno against KGSL, when MSM exists? Well there are a few ones, first MSM only really works on an up-streamed kernel, so if you have to run a down-streamed kernel you can continue using the version of KGSL that the manufacturer shipped with your device. Second this allows you to run both the proprietary adreno driver and the open source freedreno driver on the same device just by swapping libraries, which can be very nice for quickly testing something against both drivers.</description>

      <description>In this milestone 50th episode (&amp;#129395;&amp;#127881;&amp;#127867;) - I was joined by David Wengier to chat about how .NET’s hot reload works! We covered how the metadata in dotnet assemblies work, and how hot reload manipulates this data in various ways in memory to do its thing. We also touched a bit on the whole hot-reload dotnet drama thing! &amp;#129323;&amp;#128584;
We had quite a fun chat afterwards too, so decided to include that in the episode - so keep playing past my usual outro to hear that.</description>
