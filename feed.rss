      <title>Why Codecation is Important: Taking a Break to Level Up</title>
      <link>https://kaldheim.org/posts/why-codecation-is-important/</link>
      <description>As software developers, we always talk about feeling burnt out, having to constantly switch gears, and trying to keep up with all the new tech stuff. We’re always racing against the clock to get projects done, putting out fires, and sitting through never-ending meetings. Eventually, our creative juices just run dry and our drive starts to fade.
This is where Codecation comes in — a dedicated time away from from the usual grind to really dive into coding, learn new stuff, and work on projects that you’re super passionate about, without all the usual distractions from everyday life.</description>

      <title>Semi-Open Heart Protocol</title>
      <link>https://ogbe.net/blog/semi-open-heart</link>
      <description>About a week ago, the Open Heart Protocol made its way to the front page of Hacker News. I immediately thought that this looked like a lot of fun and a cool opportunity to add some more bells and whistles to this website. There is a public API, but the devs (muan and robb) also provide some code examples to self-host the backend using the Cloudflare Workers free tier. Since I am already using Cloudflare for this website, I figured I&amp;#39;d give this a try. Surprising absolutely no-one, I had to add some slight customizations to my setup.</description>

      <title>Global Query Filters: Setting the Rules Once, Querying Like a Pro - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/global-query-filters-setting-the-rules-once-querying-like-a-pro/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re running a caf&amp;#233;. Every customer who walks in gets a free cookie—no need to ask for it, no need for your staff to remember. It just happens, automatically. That’s the magic of Global Query Filters in EF Core. Once you set them up, every query automatically follows the rules, making your code simpler and your life easier. Global Query Filters are all about efficiency and consistency. Let’s dive into how they work, why they’re awesome, and how to sprinkle them into your EF Core projects like those cookies at your caf&amp;#233;.</description>

      <title>Jujutsu VCS Introduction and Patterns</title>
      <link>https://kubamartin.com/posts/introduction-to-the-jujutsu-vcs/</link>
      <description>Jujutsu (jj), a new version control system written in Rust, has popped up on my radar a few times over the past year. Looked interesting based on a cursory look, but being actually pretty satisfied with Git, and not having major problems with it, I haven’t checked it out.
That is, until last week, when I finally decided to give it a go! I dived into a couple blog posts for a few of hours, and surprisingly (noting that we’re talking about a VCS) I found myself enjoying it a lot, seeing the consistent design, and overall simplicity it managed to achieve.</description>
