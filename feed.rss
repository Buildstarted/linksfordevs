      <title>Year(Decade) of the Homelab.</title>
      <link>https://mahdiyusuf.com/posts/year-of-the-homelab/</link>
      <description>You can find audio to this post here.

As privacy and security become more of concern with breaches happening every day, more companies (Facebook) have less and less regard for your privacy.</description>
