      <title>SCM Marchant Cogito 240 Electronic Calculator</title>
      <link>https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_334770</link>
      <description> This ten-key, non-printing electronic desktop calculator performs the four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The factors and results are stored in three registers, two of twelve-digit capacity and the third, of twenty-four digits. The content of these registers appears in three rows on a cathode ray tube display. The top row (K) shows the entry from the keyboard, the second row (Q) the second factor or the quotient, and the third row (P) the total, product, or dividend.</description>

      <title>Catalina is checking notarization of unsigned executables</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/catalina-executables.html</link>
      <description>This is a follow-up to Allan Odgaard's excellent article macOS 10.15: Slow by Design. I want to talk specifically about the first section "Spawning a new Process", because there has been widespread misunderstanding of this. Odgaard provides a simple test to show that the first run of an executable is delayed while Catalina checks the executable's notarization status online. This occurs even for shell scripts, which cannot be code signed!</description>

      <title>Jepsen Disputes MongoDB’s Data Consistency Claims </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/05/Jepsen-MongoDB-4-2-6/</link>
      <description>In an article, MongoDB claimed their database passed “the industry’s toughest data safety, correctness, and consistency Tests”. In response, Jepsen published an article stating that MongoDB 3.6.4 had in fact failed their tests; the newer MongoDB 4.2.6 has more problems including “retrocausal transactions” where a transaction reverses order so that a read can see the result of a future write.</description>

      <title>User authentication with passwords, What’s SRP?</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/503/user-authentication-with-passwords-whats-srp/</link>
      <description>The Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol is first and foremost a Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE). 
Specifically, SRP is an asymmetric or augmented PAKE: it’s a key exchange where only one side is authenticated thanks to a password. This is usually useful for user authentication protocols. Theoretically any client-server protocol that relies on passwords (like SSH) could be doing it, bu ...</description>

      <description>As I have finally finished my new blog (to some degree, at least it’s in a presentable state now, but I am far from being done), I decided it’s time to resurrect my Bookmark Saturday I was writing more than a decade ago. So, without further ado, here are some interesting links I bookmarked in the last week.</description>
