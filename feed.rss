      <title>Mozilla's failures and a path to profitability</title>
      <link>https://blog.andrewgioia.com/posts/mozilla/</link>
      <description>I love Mozilla, I love its mission, and I love its core product, Firefox. It absolutely sucks as a business though, and its current trajectory is insolvency. Mozilla needs to focus on Firefox and core technologies, sell privacy-first software as a service, and bring back technical leadership if it truly wants to execute on its mission.</description>

      <title>Write your Own Virtual Machine</title>
      <link>https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/</link>
      <description>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's 2048 or my Roguelike. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.</description>

      <description>Recent observations of Betelgeuse have revealed that the star's unexpected and significant dimming periods in late 2019 and early 2020 were most likely caused by the ejection and cooling of dense hot gases, and that the star may be going through another dimming period more than a year early.</description>

      <title>Friday Facts #360 - 1.0 is here! | Factorio</title>
      <link>https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-360</link>
      <description>Hello, 
the atmosphere in the last week was kind of special. We experienced the feeling of the final release being on the horizon many times. And we were shown that it isn't the case time and time again. So it feels very special when it is actually becoming reality. We were trying to be especially careful with any last minute changes to make sure that we don't introduce major bugs into our precious 1.0 release. The image of all the players having the game crash on some simple stupid bug is horrifying. 
 
 
Thank you 
People thanked us on many occasions for the hard work we do. It helped lift our mood in many of the desperate moments, when bugs and problems were piling up and we didn't see the end of the tunnel. We don't say it often enough, but the...</description>
