      <title>Breaking the Frontend Monolith</title>
      <link>https://ng-journal.com/blog/2022-09-12-breaking-the-frontend-monolith/</link>
      <description>In this article, you will learn about the challenges that arise when migrating a typical frontend monolith to microfrontends. You will hear about common practices from Domain Driven Design, that will help you draw boundaries in your monolith, which in the end allows you to divide your subdomains into microfrontends.</description>

      <title>Molly Guard for Ansible | Paul&amp;#39;s page</title>
      <link>https://paul.totterman.name/posts/ansible-molly-guard/</link>
      <description>The Jargon File defines Molly
Guard as:

A shield to prevent tripping of some Big Red Switch by clumsy or ignorant
hands. Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an
IBM 4341 after a programmer’s toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice
in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk
drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you’ll see the much
less interesting description “guarded button”.</description>

      <title>Shells need strict typing</title>
      <link>https://aljaz.murerzen.eu/posts/2022-11-11-shells-need-typing/</link>
      <description>Command line shells are interactive programs for running other programs.
To run a program, just type its name followed by a list of arguments. This rudimentary language does not know any other types than strings, so the name of the program and all of its arguments are just strings, simply deliminator by spaces.
./build/my_program some-command --with-a-flag -m message input_file.txt Although very basic, this setup is easy to understand and create programs with, because these are just strings that can be handled in any programming or scripting language.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find a topic to actually work on to develop a side project. I had quite a few ideas, but always got stuck on the &amp;quot;find people and understand their needs part&amp;quot;, because I did not know people in the domain to talk to, nor could I find those people online.
 You need a way to get people to discover you.</description>

      <title>Missing Apache Airflow, is that even possible?</title>
      <link>https://geopet85.github.io/2022/11/11/step-functions-airlow.html</link>
      <description>It’s been more than a year that I have been introduced to AWS Step Functions and my team decided to use them for our internal data workflows. It all started aiming to support all our ETL processes to extract data from our various databases, external platforms and APIs and eventually load and transform our tables using dbt into our Snowflake data warehouse. However since we also started implementing product facing features which required data transformations and exports to external systems, it made sense to extend our AWS Step Functions usage for those as well.</description>

The players can adjust the angle and velocity of each throw as well as the gravitational pull of the planet.</description>

      <title>Work hard / work smart.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/work-hard-work-smart/</link>
      <description>Twitter, Lyft, Stripe and several other companies had major layoffs last week, and with the undeniable tragedy of layoffs, a frequent debate has reemerged. Are the tech employees working hard enough? Is working hard a sign of puritanical virtue? Are long hours a sign of inefficient production that ignores a century of productivity research?
Unless you place a premium on social networking engagement, participating in these debates isn’t very rewarding. Folks enter the discussion with their mind made up, some jabs are thrown, and then the discussion winds down with the participants feet solidly in their starting positions.</description>

      <description>Every time I post something that gets lots of engagement, I essentially end up carrying out a denial of service attack on myself. What does this say about the design of Mastodon and ActivityPub and the future of the fediverse?</description>

      <title>You can finally disable Snap updates</title>
      <link>https://merlijn.sebrechts.be/blog/2022-11-10-turn-off-snap-updates/</link>
      <description>During the Ubuntu Summit, a long-awaited feature was quietly released for preview: You can now completely turn off automatic updates of snaps.
“The snap refresh --hold command holds, or postpones, snap updates for individual snaps, or for all snaps on the system, either indefinitely or for a specified period of time.”
(currently only available in edge channel of snapd)
This might sound like an obvious feature to many people, but it’s a continental shift in philosophy for the Snap developers.</description>

      <title>A Simple Computation Engine in F#</title>
      <link>https://isthisit.nz/posts/2022/a-simple-computation-engine-in-fsharp/</link>
      <description>I’m in one of those reflective periods where I’m catching up on books I should have read earlier; Thomas Pynchon, Neal Stephenson, and the like. In Software Engineering one of those books is Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). SICP is known for teaching computing from basic principles using the programming language Scheme, (a (type of (lisp))). I began programming using Javascript, PHP, and Java. The first Lisp I encountered was Clojure, and I found the language and paradigm to be radically different from anything I’d ever written.</description>
