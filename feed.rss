      <title>Introducing Shadower: A Minimalistic Load Testing Tool</title>
      <link>https://eng.uber.com/introducing-shadower-a-minimalistic-load-testing-tool/</link>
      <description>Introduction Shadower is a load testing tool that allows us to provide load testing as a service to any microservice at Uber. Shadower started as a command line application that allowed us to read a local file to load test a local application. At the time, Maps PEs were heavily investing in Java GC tuning. We needed Shadower to be able to do request mirroring to make sure two different applications get about the same load and different types of loads (test multiple endpoints). In summary, we were starting the same application twice: once with the production configuration and once</description>

      <title>Writing .NET Application Services for Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://mikehadlow.com/posts/2022-06-24-writing-dotnet-services-for-kubernetes/</link>
      <description>In a traditional .NET distributed application, application services (not to be confused with the Kubernetes ‘service’ object) would either be written as IIS hosted web applications or Windows Services. When building .NET (micro)services to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster pretty much every facet of the service needs to be reconsidered, not only the hosting environment but the way configuration is accessed, how logging and monitoring work, and the options for state management and memory considerations. In this post I’ll bring my experience of migrating .NET applications to Kubernetes to enumerate some of the main ways that you’ll need to change the way you write them.</description>

      <title>What Metric to Use When Benchmarking?</title>
      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2022/what_metric_to_use_when_benchmarking.html</link>
      <description>What is the right metric to use when measuring a program&amp;#39;s performance? There
are various possibilities, from memory usage to branch prediction hit rates,
but I&amp;#39;m going to pick on two that I see widely used: CPU instructions executed
(what modern CPUs call &amp;quot;instructions retired&amp;quot;) and wall-clock time (i.e. &amp;quot;how much time has elapsed
in the real world?&amp;quot;). In this post, I&amp;#39;m going to try and compare both, showing
why each has fundamental weaknesses, before explaining why I use each in
different circumstances.</description>

      <description>In my last post I wrote about RSS/Atom and how these technologies can be used to declutter your digital life and reduce your exposure to the attention economy. Emacs (and all the amazing packages) taught me ORG mode, some basic Elisp and how to be a minimalist and use just one tool for almost everything.
Staying up-to-date with current technological trends, Security advisories, blog posts from smart people (and many other things) while not having to subscribe to every single newsletter, led me to elfeed:</description>

      <link>https://blog.fredrb.com/2022/06/30/man-db-internals/</link>
      <description>Investigating man-db internals From time-to-time I get nerd-snipped into understanding the internals of some system, library or any technology I use. This time, man was the target. I’ve discovered that man-db uses a DB (maybe that’s why there is DB in the name?) to index command names to some metadata, allowing quicker lookups on whatis and apropos commands.
Technically, apropos is just a symlink to whatis and they work very similarly to each other.</description>

      <description>C# 11 is in front of our doorsteps. A lot of the features are know, so let us have a look at the future.
We will discover some features which could be included in C# 12 or later.
Base for this is the csharplang-repository. So let&amp;#39;s discover brand new features and how they could help us in our everyday life. We will see things like:
Compound assignments in object initializer
Discriminated unions
semi-auto properties aka field
ConfigureAwait(false) on assembly level
Exponentiation operator

      <link>https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/</link>
      <description>Those who forget history often inadvertently repeat it. Some of us recall that twenty-one years ago, the most popular code hosting site, a fully Free and Open Source (FOSS)
 site called SourceForge, proprietarized all their code — never to make it FOSS again.  Major FOSS projects slowly left
 SourceForge since it was now, itself, a proprietary system, and antithetical to FOSS.  FOSS communities learned that it was a mistake to allow a for-profit, proprietary
 software company to become the dominant FOSS collaborative development site.  SourceForge slowly collapsed after the DotCom crash,
 and today, SourceForge is more advertising link-bait than it is code hosting. We learned a valuable lesson that was a bit too easy to forget — especially when corporate involvement manipulates
