      <description>There are times when firing off the same query in parallel to two or more data stores is a good choice, but normally hitting one, waiting for the response, and only hitting the second if necessary is a better approach. Here I&amp;#39;ll show how to query Redis, and if the key is missing, query MS SQL.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I accidentally &amp;quot;Disconnect&amp;quot; from a debug session instead of &amp;quot;Stopping&amp;quot; it. When this happens you leave behind a running process, holding on to files and preventing your starting a new debug session. Sometimes it also holds onto a port. Here I show how I find these processes and stop them.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I showed how to use Pulumi to create a Lambda, API gateway and upload a zip of Web API application directly to the Lambda.

In the post I&amp;#39;m going to use S3 to store the zip of a simple .NET application (not a Web API app) and point the Lambda at it, bringing all the resources up using Pulumi. One drawback of using S3 to store the zip for a Lambda is that when you update the zip in S3, AWS doesn&amp;#39;t deploy the new zip to the Lambda, but I will show a way of handling that in the next blog post. </description>

      <description>I love using Hugo and Netlify for my blog, but one thing I have not been able to get working is aliases, it might be because of a custom permalink I&amp;#39;m using, my slugs, or something else, but here is a workaround.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I discussed how values sent from the browser are bound to objects in the action methods of a controller.
If binding is not working as expected you need to examine the html element names and the types you are binding to, I showed how the FormCollection can be of help in this regard.</description>

      <title>Finding and Killing .NET Processes that you Disconnect from Instead of Stopping while Debugging on Linux | no dogma blog</title>

      <description>Sometimes I accidentally &amp;quot;Disconnect&amp;quot; from a debug session instead of &amp;quot;Stopping&amp;quot; it. When this happens you leave behind a running process, holding on to files and preventing your starting a new debug session. Sometimes it also holds onto a port. Here I show how I find these processes and stop them.</description>

      <description>This is part four of my four-part series on indexing the works of Shakespeare in Elasticsearch.

In this, I&amp;#39;ll show how to use the Elasticsearch &amp;quot;low level client&amp;quot; to perform the search. Previously, I wrote a [blog showing how to use a HttpClient](/2020/09/getting-started-with-elasticsearch-part-2-searching-with-a-httpclient/) to perform the search using Json, and this works fine, but Steve Gordon suggested I try the Elastic client as it supports things like connection pooling and still lets me use Json directly with Elasticsearch.</description>

A few weeks ago I wrote a post about using dependency injection to pick between two implementations of an interface. It was a solution I was not very happy with because it meant I had to new up the implementations inside a factory or I had to use service collection to instantiate all implementations of the interface and then use a piece of code to return the one the was wanted.</description>

 Some are angry opinion pieces from people who don’t like one technology or the other and clearly haven’t run any tests.</description>

      <title>Health Checks In ASP.NET Core For Monitoring Your Applications</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/health-checks-in-asp-net-core</link>
      <description> We all want to build robust and reliable applications that can scale indefinitely and handle any number of requests.
But with distributed systems and microservices architectures growing in complexity, it&amp;#39;s becoming increasingly harder to monitor the health of our applications.
It&amp;#39;s vital that you have a system in place to receive quick feedback of your application health.
That&amp;#39;s where health checks come in.
Health checks provide a way to monitor and verify the health of various components of an application including: - Databases - APIs - Caches - External services
Here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll show you in this week&amp;#39;s newsletter: - What are health checks - Adding a custom health check - Using existing health check libraries - Customizing the health checks response format
Let&amp;#39;s see how to implement health checks in ASP.NET Core.</description>

      <description>One thing that I find so unique about Spotify since I joined was that everyone seems so relentlessly collaborative. It was a breath of fresh air, but it took me for a loop, I kept wondering what was in the water that made everyone so supportive of one another. This was a kool-aid that I wanted to drink for once.

      <title>Episode 53: We Are .NET - with Tim Cadenbach and Matthias Jost</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0053-wearedotnet/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by both Tim Cadenbach and Matthias Jost to chat about the exciting new .NET community - We Are .NET! At its core, it’s a community portal aggregating and presenting videos, blogs, twitch, and other feeds of any creator with .NET content. However, it’s not just content aggregation though - and is becoming a rapidly growing community.
  Tim Cadenbach Tim is a developer evangelist at Deepl and Microsoft MVP.</description>
