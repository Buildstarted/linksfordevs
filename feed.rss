      <title>Build a Pokedex with NextJS and Tailwind CSS - SSR vs SSG</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMRAEUPkFXI</link>
      <description>NextJS is a powerful framework built on top of React that allows you to easily mix Static Pages and Server Side Rendered pages. In this video, we'll use NextJS to build a cool Pokedex using the Pokemon API. The index page will be a statically generated page while the Pokemon details pages will be server-side rendered. We'll also use Tailwind CSS for styling the app.
