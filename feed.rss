      <description>One of the annoying things about learning a new programming language / library is to remember all the small nuances that come with it.

      <title>Haskell: Day 1/∞</title>
      <link>https://andrew-quinn.me/haskell-day-1/</link>
      <description>I want to become a Haskell developer.
Last year, during my unemployment, I cracked open Haskell Programming from First Principles and read through all 1200 plus pages. I did every exercise, made Anki flashcards of every quirk of the language. And after about 2 and a half months of going at it - I claimed victory.
Then I stowed it away. Because I was a new engineer in an unknown country and my financial situation was getting increasingly dire and I knew I had to find a job as soon as that passport came through from Ireland - fast.</description>

      <description>Did you see the following error in recent days in your build-pipeline:
error NETSDK1194: The &amp;quot;--output&amp;quot; option isn&amp;#39;t supported when building a solution.
If so - that is not necessarily your fault at all! Microsoft released a new SDK version, which breaks your builds. Let&amp;#39;s see why and what we can do to tackle that.

      <description>I’ve been writing a pubsub listener for work recently and had this silly “shower thought”: the ideal queue should be empty. Why? If the queue is not empty, it means that whatever job is consuming from the queue is not keeping up with messages coming into it. Ok, then if queues are supposed to be empty, then what are they good for?</description>
