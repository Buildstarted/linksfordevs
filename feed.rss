      <title>Downtown Doug Brown &amp;#187; The capacitor that Apple soldered incorrectly at the factory</title>
      <link>https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/11/the-capacitor-that-apple-soldered-incorrectly-at-the-factory/</link>
      <description>There have been some past rumblings on the internet about a capacitor being installed backwards in Apple’s Macintosh LC III. The LC III was a “pizza box” Mac model produced from early 1993 to early 1994, mainly targeted at the education market. It also manifested as various consumer Performa models: the 450, 460, 466, and 467. Clearly, Apple never initiated a huge recall of the LC III, so I think there is some skepticism in the community about this whole issue. Let’s look at the situation in more detail and understand the circuit. Did Apple actually make a mistake?</description>

      <title>The weird BLE-Lock</title>
      <link>https://nv1t.github.io/blog/the-weired-ble-lock/</link>
      <description>tl;dr; My knowledge in Bluetooth LE Communication got quite rusty over time and i wanted to refresh it with an easy target the other day. I wanted to open up the lock with a simple bluetooth command but ended up having access to their entire backend database with a lot of unique users across their entire product lineup.
It didn’t go as planned.
The Lock and API As all BLE-Locks work, they require an App to talk to the Lock itself and an API on the company side.</description>

      <title>Functional programming self-affirmations</title>
      <link>https://norikitech.com/posts/functional-affirmations/</link>
      <description>Dmitrii Kovanikov writes posts about enterprise software development and functional programming, both entertaining and serious. I never used a functional programming language (such as Haskell or OCaml) at work, but several ideas from functional programming have become popular in mainstream general-purpose programming languages such as Swift (which I mostly write). Often even a partially functional approach produces simpler code that’s easy to understand and quick to write and maintain. I’m always looking for good ideas I can adopt to write better code, whatever their source.</description>
