      <title>Human vs JSON output formatting: avoid mixing concerns</title>
      <link>https://blog.liw.fi/posts/2025/output-formatting/</link>
      <description>Two of the original ideas about Unix is that each program should do
one thing and that programs should be able to be combine so they
consume each others' output. This led to the convention and tradition
that Unix command line programs produce output that's relatively easy
for other programs to parse.</description>

      <description>Dave Winer has been promoting his editor for WordPress sites, called WordLand, leading up to his keynote speech at WordCamp Canada in October 2025, as well as hinting about other WordPress-related projects. Recently, he asked readers to ‚ÄúThink Different About WordPress‚Äú, where he talks about how WordPress supports editing features that Mastodon and Bluesky do not support (linking, no character limits, and other features). WordPress also has ‚Äúexcellent support‚Äù for RSS and rssCloud, and has a ‚Äúdeep and powerful API‚Äú.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve got my hands on an internet-connected camera and decided to take a closer look, having already read about security issues with similar cameras. What I found far exceeded my expectations: fake access controls, bogus protocol encryption, completely unprotected cloud uploads and firmware riddled with security flaws. One could even say that these cameras are Murphy‚Äôs Law turned solid: everything that could be done wrong has been done wrong here.</description>

      <description>As a bit of background, one of my hobbies is helping people recover data from old tape cartridges, such as QIC-80 tapes, which were a rather popular backup medium in the 1990s among individuals, small businesses, BBS operators, and the like. I have a soft spot for tape media; there‚Äôs something about the tactile sensation of holding these tapes in my hands that makes the whole process very joyful, even though QIC tapes are notorious for their many design flaws. With some careful inspection and reconditioning, the data on these tapes is still totally recoverable, even after all these years.</description>

      <description>For those of us that have been using it from the start, it can be hard to believe that Direct3D 12 has been around for ten years now. Windows 10 was released on July 29th 2015, and D3D12 has been with us ever since. While it‚Äôs true that this is the longest we‚Äôve gone between major D3D version updates, it‚Äôs also not fair to say that the API has remained static.</description>

      <description>There‚Äôs a recurring fairy tale in the offshore world:


‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll put the company in our name, but you‚Äôll still control it.‚Äù



It‚Äôs the perfect sales pitch for anyone who wants your money and your company. You get ‚Äúprivacy,‚Äù they get legal control. And in corporate law, control isn‚Äôt...</description>

      <title>My Video Production Stack (for YouTube)</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/my-video-production-stack/</link>
      <description>There are two barriers to publishing videos on YouTube. The first one is getting over thinking you are cringe and the second one is video editing. You have to battle the first one on your own, but I‚Äôm hoping that with what I share below, you can ease the burden of the latter.
No-hands editing, processing and publishing
The goal of this video production stack is to take a raw video, then automatically edit it, transcribe it, come up with timestamped chapter markers for the YouTube description, and upload it to my YouTube channel. Basically this is a fully automatic publishing workflow after the point I hit stop on the record button.</description>

      <title>Juggling multiple SSH_AUTH_SOCKs in¬†tmux ‚Äì mark shroyer, dot com</title>
      <link>https://markshroyer.com/2025/09/socklink/</link>
      <description>This post is about a portable Unix shell script, socklink.sh, written to
keep SSH_AUTH_SOCK working within a long-running tmux session‚Äîeven when
switching between multiple clients that have different SSH agents, whether
those clients are simultaneously connected or attaching and detaching over
time.  I also digresses into what I‚Äôve learned from writing and testing a
cross-platform shell script in¬†2025.</description>

      <title>Recent Deep Dives</title>
      <link>https://www.nvegater.com/blog/TechExplorations2025</link>
      <description>Been thinking about LLMs as producing shadows rather than understanding - similar to Plato's cave allegory.
The outputs aren't grounded in true comprehension, but they're useful for structuring thoughts and generating starting points.
When code is involved, you can immediately test whether the shadow works in reality.</description>
