      <title>What I Wish Someone Would Have Told Me About Using Rabbitmq Before It Was Too Late</title>
      <link>https://ryanrodemoyer.github.io/what-i-wish-someone-would-have-told-me-about-using-rabbitmq-before-it-was-too-late/</link>
      <description>My watch is buzzing and in my pre-dawn stupor I cannot decipher if this is an alarm or a phone call. The time is 4:45 AM. I pull it together to realize it’s a call from a number I do not know - never a good sign. I answer and it is a coworker - my peer who runs our support team that is engaged in nearly all production issues for our customers. “Hi Ryan. Sorry to wake you, I know it’s early. Our biggest customer is reporting their requests are taking over two hours to return results. We think it’s because of our messaging system but we aren’t sure where to go from here. We need your help. Please join our call.” A few moments later my watch buzzed again as my morning alarm sounded. Today, this morning will not be for a workout.

      <title>Advice for the next dozen Rust GUIs</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/07/15/next-dozen-guis.html</link>
      <description>A few times a week, someone asks on the #gui-and-ui channel on the Rust Discord, “what is the best UI toolkit for my application?” Unfortunately there is still no clear answer to this question. Generally the top contenders are egui, Iced, and Druid, but web-based approaches are in the running, and of course there’s always the temptation to just build a new one. And every couple or months or so, a post appears with a new GUI toolkit.</description>

      <description>Theme parks are great – but only if you trust they’re secure. The same is true for the internet. A new EU law would make website security weaker by imposing QWACs and expose users to more cyber risks.</description>

      <title>learning braille</title>
      <link>https://hippocanvas.com/posts/learning%20braille.md</link>
      <description>Many years ago, I shared office space with a fascinating man named Mike. An elderly fellow with a long career in finance, every morning he would plop into his Aeron and spend the day making calls to his buddies, probably to invite them to give talks or join new financial initiatives. He had severe losses in his hearing, which he had transformed into impressive gains in speaking loudness. All the sound waves that missed his speakerphone simply spilled to the rest of the office. The students nearby got a kick from overhearing his conversations because of his no-shits-given attitude and dark humor. He would tell his friends: I have 3 children, each of them flawed in their own ways, but they have given me 6 grandchildren, each of them perfect -- grandchildren are God&amp;#39;s way of telling you to not kill your children!</description>

      <title>The Golden Age of Vertical ERPs - Part 1/3</title>
      <link>https://www.matttbrown.com/notes/the-golden-age-of-vertical-erps</link>
      <description>Vertical ERPs (VERPs) will be one of the largest and most exciting software categories over the next decade. VERPs are purpose-built applications that centralize and automate core processes for a particular type of business (such as Toast, Mindbody, and Bonsai), consolidating the everyday workflows that would otherwise require a patchwork of tools.</description>

      <description>I blogged about Dart a few weeks ago, and I said it was refreshingly boring. I am probably late to the party (well, evidently I am, as it’s been around since 2014), but I discovered Crystal recently, and it is not only boring but also surprising in many delicious ways.</description>

      <description>For the entirety of this post, we assume a non-real-time system. First of all, why do we have TIMEOUT as a type of replies? What if we don&amp;#39;t?

      <description>About The Iron Searcher Between this previous post, where I share my excitement for the Crystal programming language, and this more recent previous post, where I go over my own take at The Silver Seacher but in Ruby, I decided to try out my own take at a file search command line utility but in Crystal, and thus The Iron Searcher was born (Go read the README for what’s in a name and more).</description>
