      <title>Newton Papers : College Notebook</title>
      <link>http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-04000/</link>
      <description>Add. 4000 is a small notebook that Newton appears to have begun using in the winter of 1663-4. He continued to write in it extensively over the next two or three years, mostly jotting down personal annotation of his mathematical discoveries. It contains notes on his mathematical and geometrical reading, drawn from Frans van Schooten’s Exercitationummathematicarum (Leiden, 1657) and from his edition of the works of François Viète (Leiden, 1646), as well as from the writings of William Oughtred and of the Oxford mathematician, John Wallis. Newton was particularly interested in Wallis’ Arithmetica infinitorum (included in his Operum Mathematicorum Pars Altera (1656)), in which problems of mathematical methods of reasoning about the quadrature of areas and volumes through consideration of their indivisible elements of line and surface were set out. This notebook also contains evidence of the development of Newton’s own mathematical skill in this period, especially his study of infinite series and development of the binomial theorem, the evolution of the differential calculus, and its application to the problem of quadratures and integration. Although Newton had been inspired in his mathematical work on curved lines and surfaces by reading Wallis and most likely by listening to the lectures that Barrow delivered in 1664, his knowledge of Descartes’ geometry was also critical in these discoveries. This notebook also contains Newton’s investigation of the musical scale in ‘Of Musick’ (c. 1665) [fols 138r-143r]. Musical theory was at the time considered as part of the mathematical sciences. One of the later entries in this notebook derives from Newton’s knowledge of Descartes’ La dioptrique (1637), which Newton probably read in a Latin edition published at Paris in 1656. By September 1664, Newton had learned about the sine law of refraction through his reading of Descartes’ works, and, in the winter of 1665-6, he investigated Descartes’ findings about refraction at curved surfaces. This is probably the date of the composition of the essay ‘Of Refractions’ [fols 26r-33r]. Newton later told Oldenburg that he had first applied himself to grinding lenses that were not spherical in the winter of 1666 and this essay includes the detailed description of a machine for shaping a wheel to a hyperbolical profile, which could later be used for grinding lenses. Such a machine had been discussed in chapter ten of La dioptrique, but Newton improved the design and gave a geometrical demonstration of its operation.

      <title>US Border Patrol Says They Can Create Central Repository Of Traveler Emails, Keep Them For 75 Years - View from the Wing</title>
      <link>https://viewfromthewing.com/us-border-patrol-says-they-can-create-central-repository-of-traveler-emails-keep-them-for-75-years/</link>
      <description>The U.S. government has taken the opportunity during the global pandemic, when people aren't traveling out of the country much, to roll out a new platform for storing information they believe they are entitled to take from people crossing the border.  A new filing reveals how the U.S. Border Patrol will store data from traveler devices centrally, keeping it backed up and searchable for up to 75 years.</description>

      <title>Coding Adventure: Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxfEbulyFcY</link>
      <description>The planets in my solar system project are looking a bit hostile and uninviting, so in this video I'll be attempting to add some cozy atmospheres around them.

Some notes:
• I made a little build where you can play with the atmosphere settings yourself, which you can find over here if you're interested: https://sebastian.itch.io/atmosphere-experiment

• A number of knowledgeable people have pointed out in the comments that reality is not nearly as simple as my little diagram around 4:35, and that light does not literally wiggle up and down like a wave, so please note that the diagram is incorrect!

• This project was inspired by the game Outer Wilds, which I highly recommend playing!

Project Files:
The atmosphere code is currently only available to patrons of the channel, so if you'd like to get early access to it (and support my work in the process!) you can find it here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-files-40730130
It will be freely available to everyone from September 15.

      <description>Containers are confusing. They are a buzzword that everyone is saying but no one understands. Why use them? Why are they better than virtual machines? How are they different than just using a machine regularly? Let's build a Dockerfile FROM Scratch and built it up to an Nginx webserver and finally a multistage Dockerfile with building, testing, and running, in production, in just 30 min!</description>
