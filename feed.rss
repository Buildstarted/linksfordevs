      <title>Some business advice for academic startups/spinouts - Bert Hubert&amp;#39;s writings</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/some-academic-business-advice/</link>
      <description>So I love academia, and I also built two businesses. When I dropped out of studying physics to focus on my company, I assumed I knew everything, since I had studied physics!
Turned out that if you enter the world of commerce, it is very bad if you are visibly confused about the difference between business development and sales. It does nothing for your credibility. People in enterprise will likely and correctly conclude that you know nothing about running companies if you are hazy on concepts that are fundamental to them.</description>
