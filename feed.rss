      <title>Cloud tech makes sense on-prem too</title>
      <link>https://ergaster.org/posts/2025/08/20-cloud-tech-on-prem/</link>
      <description>I can spin up new VMs on the server in my living room and install software on it. But it's more complex than just installing the software on a baremetal server. Fortunately for me, cloud technologies such as opentofu, cloud-init, and ansible can let me spin up and configure local VMs in seconds.</description>

      <title>My take on blog analytics</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2025/08/31/my-take-on-blog-analytics</link>
      <description>I recently read You do not need “analytics” for your blog because you are neither a military surveillance unit nor a commodity trading company by Leon Paternoster. It’s a well-argued piece, and I agree with the general thrust… but I also won’t be removing analytics from my site anytime soon.</description>

      <title>The Parallelism Mesh Zoo : ezyang’s blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.ezyang.com/2025/08/the-parallelism-mesh-zoo/</link>
      <description>When training large scale LLMs, there is a large assortment of parallelization strategies which you can employ to scale your training runs to work on more GPUs.  There are already a number of good resources for understanding how to parallelize your models: I particularly recommend How To Scale Your Model and The Ultra-Scale Playbook.  The purpose of this blog post is to discuss parallelization strategies in a more schematic way by focusing only on how they affect your device mesh.  The device mesh is an abstraction used by both PyTorch and JAX that takes your GPUs (however many of them you've got in your cluster!) and organizes them into a N-D tensor that expresses how the devices communicate with each other.  When we parallelize computation, we shard a tensor along one dimension of the mesh, and then do collectives along that dimension when there are nontrivial dependencies between shards.  Being able to explain why a device mesh is set up the way it is for a collection of parallelization strategies is a good check for seeing if you understand how the parallelization strategies work in the first place!

      <description>I am huge a fan of the SI system, but I’ve often noticed that even my academic colleagues take a mix-and-match aproach to the BIPM standards. It is common for chemists to use Ångstrom over nanometre, and I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone use megagram over tonne.</description>

      <title>How World of Warcraft Private Servers Work Total Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://youtu.be/0sX-hH9NAeM</link>
      <description>To learn for free on Brilliant, go to https://brilliant.org/Tariq10x/ . You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

Ever wondered how World of Warcraft private servers actually work behind the scenes? In this video, I dive deep into the C++ source code of AzerothCore, explaining the architecture, networking, and gameplay logic that makes these servers possible.

We’ll walk through how the server handles client connections, authentication, packet parsing, and game world simulation. I’ll also highlight some of the clever software engineering tricks and reverse engineering techniques used by developers to recreate the server side.

Whether you’re interested in game development, MMORPG server emulation, or just curious about the C++ code that powers private servers, this breakdown will give you an inside look at the technical details and architecture that make it all work.
If you enjoy this kind of code review and game architecture analysis, check out my other videos on Doom, Quake, Diablo, and more classic game engines!

      <title>Tokenizing search engine queries for diverse results</title>
      <link>https://studium.dev/tech/simple-serp-strategy</link>
      <description>Here’s a simple and neat approach to using search engines I came up with today: Find a tokenizer to use for your search query. In this case our query is online tokenizer Add spaces between the tokens from the tokenizer output for your new query: online tokenizer → online token izer Potentially pull up new and previously unseen search results online tokenizer DuckDuckGo Original query results: Tokenized query results: Some of the result differences: I intend to study this more in depth eventually, if you want you can find my progress here: github.</description>

      <title>Nobody Gets Fired For Reporting the Error to Sentry</title>
      <link>https://apimason.com/blog/nobody-gets-fired-for-reporting-the-error-to-sentry</link>
      <description>Error tracking services were a gift to the development world decades ago, but their effectiveness today is similar to uptime trackers that confirm your app's webpage is up. Modern applications are complex API ecosystems where customer jobs fall through cracks despite excellent system health metrics.</description>

      <title>The Silk Road vs. Sapiens: Why Popular History Shouldn't Mean False History</title>
      <link>https://kaifiyat.blog/posts/thesilkroadsvssapiens/</link>
      <description>Christopher Columbus set sail in 1492, “certain though he was of finding the Great Khan – and of the role he would play in the liberation of Jerusalem.” Not to spread enlightenment, as Yuval Noah Harari would have us believe in Sapiens, but on a religious mission to defeat Muslims and claim wealth for Christian Europe.
This single quote from Peter Frankopan’s The Silk Road captures exactly what frustrated me so deeply about Sapiens. Where Harari spins a neat story about European exploration driven by academic curiosity and enlightenment values, Frankopan provides the messy, complicated, properly researched truth: Columbus was a religious zealot seeking the Great Khan to fight a holy war.
