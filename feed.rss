      <title>C++ exceptions are becoming more and more problematic</title>
      <link>http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2544r0.html</link>
      <description>Many projects avoid or even actively disable C++ exceptions due to a number of reasons (see [P0709R4] for a detailed discussion).
The unfortunate reality is that, while exceptions are the default error reporting mechanism in C++, there are good reasons for avoiding them.
In fact the current trend to high core counts makes exceptions unsustainable, at least in their current implementation.
In the following, we first illustrate and quantify the problem, and then discuss potential mitigations.
The source code for all experiments is available at [ep].</description>

      <title>SPAs were a mistake</title>
      <link>https://gomakethings.com/spas-were-a-mistake/</link>
      <description>For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!</description>

      <link>https://erikvancraddock.com/2022/02/learn-to-listen/</link>
      <description>Most people anticipate what you are going to say. Often they will respond to what they think you should have said instead of what you actually say. I suspect that this is the root of many disagreements. We get in to debates where we passionately agree with each other while thinking we are in an argument. Most of us never learned to how to listen.
We spend a good portion of our young lives being educated.</description>

analogy to pip and npm.  Cargo/rust doesn’t suffer from many of the problems
that pip does.  Some of these reasons are not just about cargo, they’re also
about how Rust is different to Python and about how Cargo and Rust integrate:</description>

      <title>We Need Higher Quality Note-Taking Applications</title>

      <description>There are so many note-taking apps right now: Notion, Roam Research, Joplin, Standard Notes, Obsidian, Logseq, Zettlr, RemNote, and many more.
Unfortunately, all of these note-taking apps are lacking in quality; most of them are SAAS, and their desktop apps are made in Electron, which is equivalent to running a website in Google Chrome, as an individual instance, mind you. It would take less resources to just open another tab.</description>
