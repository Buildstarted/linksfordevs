      <title>Solved: .NET 5 “SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE” in Firefox</title>
      <link>https://seankilleen.com/2021/01/solved-net-5-sec_error_inadequate_key_usage-in-firefox/</link>
      <description>Ran across an issue I had to fix where a .NET 5 application, which happened to be running in a Docker container (this ended up being irrelevant), couldn’t start up in Firefox due to a certificate error, even though I’d accepted the .NET certificate at the root. I saw a SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE error in the browser.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/working-with-azure-storage-blobs-with-a-java-azure-function/</link>
      <description>Bryan Soltis shows how to create a simple Java Azure Function to work with Azure Storage files.

      <title>FAQ on 2021 License Change | Elastic</title>
      <link>https://www.elastic.co/pricing/faq/licensing</link>
      <description>We are changing the Apache 2.0-licensed source code of Elasticsearch and Kibana to be dual licensed under SSPL 1.0 and the Elastic License, giving users the choice of which license to apply. Our default distribution will continue to be under the Elastic License as it has been for nearly the last three years, and we will no longer produce an Apache 2.0 distribution.</description>

      <title>Fun with conversion-operator name lookup

      <description>As of this writing (but perhaps not for very much longer!) the four mainstream compilers
on Godbolt Compiler Explorer give four different answers for
this simple C++ program:

      <title>Deskreen</title>
      <link>https://www.deskreen.com/</link>
      <description>&amp;quot;It all started with me wanting to use my iPad as a second screen for my Macbook. But I found that it is already outdated to use a MacOS built in feature called &amp;#39;Sidecar&amp;#39; and I have to buy a new iPad. I also have a Windows PC and sometimes I needed to use my iPad as second screen for it as well. I tried to look for FREE solutions out there, but I could not find anything that would fit my requirements. Besides, all methods and software I found were different for Windows, Mac and Linux. I got very confused about it. Then I got an idea of creating Deskreen. I decided to make it free and open-source to help people to solve this problem. Deskreen works the same for Windows, MacOS and Linux.</description>

Before now, I had known him mostly for his cooking pictures on Twitter, the kind that made me envious of suburbanites and their 75,000 BTU woks. But now he was the test subject for my new project, to see if it was going to be fruitful or a waste of time.

      <link>https://eiken.dev/blog/2020/11/code-spotlight-the-reference-implementation-of-ed25519-part-1/</link>
      <description>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has always been something I wanted to fully understand eventually. A recent project I worked on has brought me one step closer, but also revealed to me the true complexity of the topic. I am now convinced that I will probably never fully understand the maths behind ECC.
However, I discovered something else that I find interesting, although it’s not necessarily easier: implementing given schemes. In this post, I want to take you on a journey to explore a state-of-the-art implementation of a cryptographic scheme.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Code &amp;#187; Software effort estimation is mostly fake research</title>
      <link>http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2021/01/17/software-effort-estimation-is-mostly-fake-research/</link>
      <description>Effort estimation is an important component of any project, software or otherwise.  While effort estimation is something that everybody in industry is involved with on a regular basis, it is a niche topic in software engineering research.  The problem is researcher attitude (e.g., they are unwilling to venture into the wilds of industry), which has stopped them acquiring the estimation data needed to build realistic models.  A few intrepid people have risked an assault on their ego and talked to people in industry, the outcome has been, until very recently, a small collection of tiny estimation datasets.</description>

The security of the New World we are building online is heavily dependent on password security but, despite this, password reuse and negligence continue to be a problem for the world’s Web users.
