      <description>Time and time again I come across fantastic blogs that I want to subscribe to but can’t find a feed for. First I try putting the site into my RSS reader (Miniflux is my tool of choice) but it often can’t find anything. Then I search around the site for the little RSS icon or a link but come up blank. As a last resort I start sticking common paths on the domain and with some luck I might finally find a feed on /feed.</description>

      <title>What about design? | Grumpy pep.</title>
      <link>https://bouah.net/2020/07/what-about-design/</link>
      <description>Who around here hasn’t heard about the tragic and inevitable death of XMPP
(eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)? It’s a pretty common topic in
the community and around, often started by users of XMPP themselves missing a
certain feature in one or multiple specific implementations, or users of
alternative solutions. In a way this is my own version of why XMPP is or isn’t
doomed.</description>

      <description>I am convinced that cross-platform is the future for frontend. I don’t want to work separately from the Android team, or even web. There’s this strange disconnect that I honestly hate. It feels like a different company, even when working within the same squad. It sucks. &amp;mdash; Rui</description>

      <title>Ingradient: building the cooking tool I've always wanted</title>
      <link>http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/ingradient-building-the-cooking-tool-ive-always-wanted/</link>
      <description>Years ago, a cooking blog got me thinking about reverse-engineering recipes. I thought I could build an application for that. For those of us privileged enough to contribute, open source software is an endless time sync. I kept putting off the idea for some other shiny pet project–usually JSHint.
With my work on JSHint finally maybe wrapping up, and with a whole lot of extra time due to coronavirus-inspired lifestyle changes, I finally set out to build the thing in March.</description>

      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/sort-data-with-aspnet-core-and-query-strings</link>
      <description>Anyone building a web application will eventually have to deal with sorting tabular data. It’s a rule established into the constitution of the internet (if there was one). While it may be simple in concept, its implementation can be daunting based on many application-specific factors.</description>

      <link>https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/a-new-more-simplified-setup-for-x-ray-tracing-of-net-applications/</link>
      <description>AWS X-Ray is a service that helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications. Customers use X-Ray to monitor application traces, including the performance of calls to other downstream components or services, in either cloud-hosted applications or from their own machines during development. Until now, setting up this trace capability for .NET applications required that customers […]</description>

      <title>Tip 271 - Azure Functions and secure configuration with Azure Key Vault</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip271.html</link>
      <description>Almost every application uses application secrets. These are often values that you use to connect to other services, like a connection string to Azure Storage, or an API key to connect with a 3rd party API. Where do you store these secrets securely? And how can you make sure that the right people can configure these secrets? (like DevOps engineers). You shouldn't store secrets in your application code, because every developer would be able to see them. You could store your secrets in the application configuration of your app, like in the configuration settings of your Azure Function. This works, but requires DevOps engineers to go into the configuration settings of all individual services to update a setting if the value changes.</description>
