      <title>Episode 51: Brighter - with Ian Cooper</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0051-brighter/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Ian Cooper to chat about the Brighter and Darker frameworks.
Brighter is a framework for building messaging applications with .NET and C#. It can be used with an in-memory bus, or for interoperability in a microservices architecture allowing out of process messaging via a wider range of middleware transports. And Darker is the query counterpart to Brighter.
Ian is a Senior Principal Engineer at Just Eat Takeaway, frequent public speaker, and organiser of London .</description>

      <title>Implementing and Exploiting Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://www.manning.com/books/implementing-and-exploiting-cryptography</link>
      <description>Learn how the good guys implement cryptography and how the bad guys exploit it.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;

In Implementing and Exploiting Cryptography&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; you’ll find unique guidance for creating strong cryptography that can withstand attempts to exploit it including:

DUAL_EC_DRBG random number generator using Go’s elliptic curve library&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Exploiting the RC4 stream cipher, as used in WEP&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Block ciphers for padding oracle attacks and manipulation of initialization-vectors&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Exploiting hash functions by using extension and rainbow table attacks&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Implementing RSA key generation using the Miller-Rabin primality test and exploiting it using the Weiner attack&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Exploiting PKCS1.5 padding by using Bleichenbacher&amp;#39;s chosen-ciphertext attack&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
Implementing Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and breaking it using a MITM parameter injection attack&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

Theoretically strong cryptography often becomes vulnerable to exploitation as soon as it’s built into real applications and networks. Implementing and Exploiting Cryptography&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; details dozens of practical cryptographic implementations and then breaks down the flaws that adversaries use to exploit them. You’ll learn just what it takes to write cryptographically secure code, build an intuition for spotting potential vulnerabilities, and master techniques to avoid the pitfalls that leave your systems at risk.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Future of AI: Strategies for Survival</title>
      <link>https://dzidas.com/ml/2023/03/19/chatgtp-eats-the-world/</link>
      <description>Lately, reading the news and following updates about advancements in AI, specifically in Generative AI and chatGPT, gave me mixed feelings - on one hand, we are on something big and impactful, but at the same time it feels like a potential threat to the future. And I’m not alone - NLP students lost their field of research overnight, meanwhile some orgs at FAANG became obsolete. It is an old news that chatGPT can pass a software developer tests at FAANG, an exam to become a lawyer or generate inspirational phrases for your YouTube shorts. But I’m sceptical that we will experience a radical transformation in a short time of a few years, but rather, it will be an iterative change which can take a decade or more. But as a story goes, a slowly boiled frog was too comfortable to jump out of a pot, the fate we shall avoid.</description>
