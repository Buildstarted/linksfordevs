      <title>Dev Around The Sun 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt7LPX4_toI</link>
      <description>Please donate! https://bit.ly/DATS2020

We are bringing together technologists, from all backgrounds and from around the globe, with two important goals in mind: to raise awareness and provide financial support for the many people fighting the current coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, while also delivering hope and reconnecting those in our global developer community.

Dev Around The Sun is a cross-platform, language-agnostic event, with high-level tech talks, as well as human skills talks. We have renowned speakers from a broad set of communities, spanning many technologies and all continents, who will educate, entertain, and inspire our international audience in the comfort of their own homes.

We want to ensure that no matter who you are and what role technology plays in your life, you have the opportunity to take part in a very important cause during these times, while at the same time being part of a vast community of people with shared interests.

By collecting funds via attendee contributions, corporate sponsorships, and matching donations, we will all be able to give back to those affected by this crisis, with the hope that folks taking part in this event will be able contribute in any way they can.

Our schedule of speakers is available on the website: https://devaroundthesun.org/schedule</description>

      <title>A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-010-a-2020-vision-of-linear-algebra-spring-2020/index.htm</link>
      <description>These six brief videos, recorded in 2020, contain ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. The first topic is called A New Way to Start Linear Algebra. The key point is to start right in with the columns of a matrix A and the multiplication Ax that combines those columns.That leads to The Column Space of a Matrix and the idea of independent columns and the factorization A = CR that tells so much about A.  With good numbers, every student can see dependent columns.The remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: The Big Picture of Linear Algebra; Orthogonal Vectors; Eigenvalues &amp;amp; Eigenvectors; and Singular Values &amp;amp; Singular Vectors.  Singular values have become so important and they come directly from the eigenvalues of A'A.You can see this new idea developing in the first video lecture of Professor Strang&amp;rsquo;s 2019 course 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>Memory and performance are tightly coupled to each other in .NET. If you don’t create a “garbage collector friendly” application, you’ll have performance problems. In extreme cases, those problem turn into memory pressure, also known as GC pressure. This situation occurs when the application spends too much time in garbage collection instead of executing application […]</description>

      <title>Performance Characteristics of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and Seroprevalence in Boise, Idaho</title>
      <link>https://jcm.asm.org/content/early/2020/05/07/JCM.00941-20</link>
      <description>Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020, necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 for which 689 excess serum specimens were available and found sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested 4,856 individuals from Boise, Idaho collected over one week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Guitar Effect Emulation</title>
      <link>https://teddykoker.com/2020/05/deep-learning-for-guitar-effect-emulation/</link>
      <description>Since the 1940s, electric guitarists, keyboardists, and other instrumentalists have been using effects pedals, devices that modify the sound of the original audio source. Typical effects include distortion, compression, chorus, reverb, and delay. Early effects pedals consisted of basic analog circuits, often along with vacuum tubes, which were later replaced with transistors. Although many pedals today apply effects digitally with modern signal processing techniques, many purists argue that the sound of analog pedals can not be replaced by their digital counterparts. We’ll follow a deep learning approach to see if we can use machine learning to replicate the sound of an iconic analog effect pedal, the Ibanez Tube Screamer. This post will be mostly a reproduction of the work done by Alec Wright et al. in Real-Time Guitar Amplifier Emulation with Deep Learning1.

      <title>Encouraging a Culture of Written Communication – mcls</title>
      <link>https://www.mcls.io/blog/encouraging-a-culture-of-written-communication</link>
      <description>More and more people are being exposed to working remotely. One of the key factors for success in a remote workplace is a culture of written communication. It’s not always obvious how to create such a culture, and it takes at least some level of discipline from the people involved to make it a habit.</description>
