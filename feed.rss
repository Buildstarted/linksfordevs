      <title>Having A Game I’m Really Into Makes Every Day Incredibly Enjoyable | Plumshell</title>
      <link>http://plumshell.com/2023/12/23/having-a-game-im-really-into-makes-every-day-incredibly-enjoyable/</link>
      <description>About a month ago, I became hooked on mahjong, the ultimate game. It&amp;#39;s a bit late in my life to start, but that&amp;#39;s how it is.   In the past, I might have thought, &amp;quot;Playing games like this would be ruinous, leading to personal downfall.&amp;quot; But now, as I&amp;#39;ve grown older, I&amp;#39;ve stopped worrying about these concerns and am thoroughly enjoying this obsession. I&amp;#39;m living in the moment.   Throughout my life, I&amp;#39;ve only occasionally found activities so captivating that I&amp;#39;d sacrifice sleep for them, perhaps once every five years.   First, there was soccer in elementary school, then guitar and drums in high school. After that, I got into FPS games and eventually found programming, which led to a career. Later, I enjoyed reading comics and books at a leisurely pace; it was more of a gradual enjoyment rather than an obsession that would cost me sleep.   A few years ago, I had a brief but intense period of playing Valorant, another FPS game. The daily happiness and the time spent improving during that</description>

      <title>Bug story: Sorting by timestamp</title>
      <link>https://adam-p.ca/blog/2023/12/sort-by-timestamp/</link>
      <description>While reviewing a co-worker’s results-paging design I realized there was a bug in some paging code I wrote1 a few years ago. It’s unlikely to manifest and kind of subtle, but I thought that describing it here might be useful to others writing such code (including my future self). It comes down to sorting by timestamp…</description>

      <title>Indexing a billion pages</title>
      <link>https://blog.mwmbl.org/articles/indexing-a-billion/</link>
      <description>It’s two years since we launched Mwmbl, the open source, non-profit search engine, on Boxing Day 2021. A good time to take stock of where we are and where we’re going.
We’ve indexed over 100 million pages Thanks to our volunteers, who crawl the web using the Firefox extension and command line script, we’re crawling up to a million pages a day, as you can see on our stats page. There are around 50-60 users crawling on an average day.</description>

      <link>https://udel.edu/~mm/xmas/</link>
      <description>The second block has more real work going on.  If the character stored
in the variable _ does not match the first character of the
string a, the code recurses in such a way that this same block
of code will again be entered.  That is, t=-65 forces a return
to the if (t &amp;lt; -50) block.  The recursion steps through string
a, character by character.  When finally _ == a, the
character at a+31 is printed and returned.</description>
