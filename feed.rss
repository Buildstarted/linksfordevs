      <title>Adding a UI to a Container Registry Is Not Simple</title>
      <link>https://molnett.com/blog/25-07-07-container-registry-story-part-1</link>
      <description>It turned out to be easy enough to build our own in a weekend, so we did. But building a dashboard revealed how little we actually knew about what was happening inside our registry or even how it works! Join me learning about container formats and registries in this 4 part series. This is part 1.</description>

      <title>Sandboxes? In my process? It's more likely than you think.</title>
      <link>https://dadrian.io/blog/posts/memory-safety-and-sandboxes/</link>
      <description>Discussions around memory safety often focus on choice of language, and how the language can provide memory safety guarantees. Unfortunately, choosing a language is a decision made at the start of a project. Migrating an existing C or C++ project to a safer language is much harder than starting a new project in a safe language1. I’m not going to say this is impossible, or that you can’t or shouldn’t migrate existing programs to safer languages. And sometimes people just do things in open-source, and that’s part of the fun of it.</description>

      <title>The Case for Secrets as Code: Stop Click-Managing Secrets</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/posts/secrets-as-code/</link>
      <description>We live in the age of software as a service, secret keys are everywhere. Yet somehow it is still normal to click-manage secrets. Smart people share them via signal,smarter people, share them via a password manager like Bitwarden. Super-advanced people punch them into GitHub UI and only let github actions have access to secrets. Infra-devops people spin up Vault or AWS secret manager or similar to inject secrets. In all situations secrets have a lifecycle that is completely disconnected from code, causing the two to get out of sync or worse.</description>

      <description>It has been a little over a year since I made the decision to migrate away from macOS to Linux as my primary operating system and placed an order for, then received, a Framework Laptop 16. I wrote about my impressions two week in after install the KDE Spin of Fedora Linux 40 (which has since been promoted to Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop) and using it for two weeks.</description>

      <description>It's a safe bet that most of us have encountered the age-old admonition to "never judge a book by its cover" at some point in our lives. There is a deep wisdom in that advice---wisdom that seems to go completely out the window as soon as a certain type of person spots a certain type of punctuation.</description>

      <title>Mercury: Ultra-Fast Language Models Based on Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17298</link>
      <description>We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality frontier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall. We also release a public API at https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/ and free playground at https://chat.inceptionlabs.ai</description>

      <title>Belgium is unsafe for CVD</title>
      <link>https://floort.net/posts/belgium-unsafe-for-cvd/</link>
      <description>This post is about the reason I will probably never try to warn any organisation in Belgium about any vulnerability again. Recently I have been dealing with an attempt at coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) with an organisation in Belgium. This post is not about that, because I’m not allowed to write about it. This post explains why I believe Belgium is unsafe for people trying to do CVD. I believe it’s important to warn others so that they know what to expect and can decide for themselves.</description>

      <title>We've Issued Our First IP Address Certificate</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate/</link>
      <description>Since Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt started issuing certificates in 2015, people have repeatedly requested the ability to get certificates for IP addresses, an option that only a few certificate authorities have offered. Until now, they&amp;rsquo;ve had to look elsewhere, because we haven&amp;rsquo;t provided that feature.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve issued our first certificate for an IP address, as we announced we would in January. As with other new certificate features on our engineering roadmap, we&amp;rsquo;ll now start gradually rolling out this option to more and more of our subscribers.</description>
