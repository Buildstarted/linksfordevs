      <description>Personal infrastructure loosely refers to all the tools and systems I have to
interact on a regular basis to do my job as a PhD researcher.
As a systems researcher, this includes obvious stuff like command-line tools
and programming workflow as well as as the set of tools to build websites,
write papers, manage TODO lists, and record videos.</description>

      <title>Hang your code out to DRY</title>
      <link>https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2022/01/09/hang-your-code-out-to-dry/</link>
      <description>I recently read an article by Jason Swett where he argues against Sandi Metz’ old chestnut “duplication is better than the wrong abstraction” and it made me feel like I have to articulate why I’m Team Sandi here. I’m sure I’ve used the saying a million times in discussions with colleagues and, as such, I feel personally attacked by Jason’s article and need to defend my honor.</description>

      <title>You Can Build a Skyscraper Anywhere in Davis Right Now</title>
      <link>https://kevin.burke.dev/kevin/skyscrapers-davis-california/</link>
      <description>Right now it&amp;#39;s legal to build a skyscraper anywhere in Davis,
California (a college town outside of Sacramento). Unlimited height,
anywhere in city limits, as long as you promise to dedicate 20% of the
apartments to people with lower incomes. Well, it&amp;#39;s legal in theory, no one
has ever tested it. But you could be the one to test it! And hopefully make a
boatload of money along the way, and help prevent more sprawl into wildfire
zones.</description>

      <title>LatencyFleX: A new approach to game latency reduction | Tatsuyuki Ishi</title>
      <link>https://ishitatsuyuki.github.io/post/latencyflex/</link>
      <description>This post describes the inner workings of LatencyFleX, which is a set of libraries that achieves latency reduction for video games, made as a vendor-agnostic alternative to Nvidia Reflex.
A technology called Nvidia Reflex was released in 2020. It drastically improved system latency, by adjusting the pacing of the game’s main thread so that it kept queued GPU work to a minimal amount. If you are not familiar with the tech, I recommend watching this video from Battle(non)sense.</description>

      <title>How can I detect that a thread pool work item is taking too long?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220110-00/?p=106139</link>
      <description>A customer wants to detect that their thread pool work items are not completing quickly enough and trigger a crash if they appear to be stuck. They looked at Wait&amp;#173;For&amp;#173;Threadpool&amp;#173;Wait&amp;#173;Callbacks, but that function doesn’t support a timeout. It just waits indefinitely.</description>
