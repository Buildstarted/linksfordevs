      <description>Randy Kern, CTO at Marqeta, thinks that every engineer should &amp;quot;go deep&amp;quot; - all the way to understanding the transistors if you have to. He implores us never to be satisfied with black boxes, believing that it&amp;#39;s not only risky not to understand what your code is really doing, but it&amp;#39;s not fun either.</description>

      <title>3 Tips for Navigating the Startup Journey: Lessons Learned from a Former Facebook Engineer</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/3-tips-for-navigating/</link>
      <description>
I started my career as an engineer at Facebook before leaving to build a startup. Transitioning from a well-defined engineering individual contributor role to a nebulous startup leadership role meant a lot of falling on my face and a lot of lessons learned.
Here are 3 tips to keep in mind if you’re starting on this journey and want to fail less than I did.
1. Focus on What Matters by Zooming Out
In every context, it’s important to not get stuck on unimportant details.
When building an early stage startup your time is one of the few resources you can spend, so you better be spending it wisely.</description>

      <description>Blog article by Jeroen Janssens. Jan 19, 2023. 13 min read. TL;DR To improve my iTerm+tmux experience, I’ve set up a whole bunch of key mappings. Rather than defining these manually, I wrote a Python script to generate the corresponding JSON programmatically. Fixing prefixing I’ve recently refound my love for tmux. Having multiple terminal panes, windows, and even sessions helps me keep my command-line shenanigans organized. By default, you interact with tmux by pressing a prefix key (Ctrl-B)...</description>

      <title>Death of the Author</title>
      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/death-of-the-author/</link>
      <description>In my last post I wrote about Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus. The article sparked a really nice discussion over at Hacker News, where a user had this to say:
Ideas should be judged on their merits, but based on previous behavior I wouldn’t necessarily trust Johann Hari’s writing out of hand - ie other things in the book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Hari
It’s a valid observation, and it got me thinking again about a concept I’ve been mulling over for a long time: Death of the Author.</description>

      <title>Huge Pages are a Good Idea (evanjones.ca)</title>
      <link>https://www.evanjones.ca/hugepages-are-a-good-idea.html</link>
      <description>Nearly all programs are written to access virtual memory addresses, which the CPU must translate to physical addresses. These translations are usually fast because the mappings are cached in the CPU&amp;#39;s Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Unfortunately, virtual memory on x86 has used a 4 kiB page size since the 386 was released in 1985, when computers had a bit less memory than they do today. Also unfortunately, TLBs are pretty small because they need to be fast. For example, AMD&amp;#39;s Zen 4 Microarchitecture, which first shipped in September 2022, has a first level data TLB with 72 entries, and a second level TLB with 3072 entries. This means when an application&amp;#39;s working set is larger than approximately 4 kiB &amp;#215; 3072 = 12 MiB, some memory accesses will require page table lookups, multiplying the number of memory accesses required. This is a brand-new CPU, with one of the biggest TLBs on the market, so most systems will be worse. Using larger virtual memory page sizes (aka huge pages) can reduce page mapping overhead substantially. Since RAM is so much larger than it was in 1985, a larger page size seems like obviously a good idea to me.</description>
