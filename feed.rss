      <description>The Problem # Take a square piece of paper. Take a toothpick of a given length. At intervals equal to the length of the toothpick, draw lines on the piece of paper. Now, randomly toss a bunch of such toothpicks so that they fall over the paper. What fraction of the toothpicks will fall in a way so that they intersect one of the lines drawn? In other words, what is the probability of a single toothpick falling over a line?</description>

      <title>Building a basic search experience with Postgres</title>
      <link>https://www.pacenthink.io/post/building-a-basic-search-experience-with-postgres/</link>
      <description>Building search functionality in products is a common task. Many solutions exist to solve this problem already. OpenSource tools like opensearch and mellisearch are some examples that are very commonly used. Using a 3rd party tool to build a &amp;amp;ldquo;full-text search&amp;amp;rdquo; is a good bet if you have a lot of data (i.e. a lot of users).
The goal of this post is to have a look at some in-built tools to build a minimalist search feature when your data is backed by a Postgres (or any SQL) database.</description>

      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-birth-of-a-package-manager/</link>
      <description>Since my time at the university, pursuing a Computer Science degree, I have always been fascinated by programming languages and the tooling around them: compilers, IDEs, package managers, etc. Eventually, that got me involved as a hobbyist in the development of the Rust compiler and rust-analyzer, but I never got the chance to work professionally on programming language tooling… until two months ago! In January, the nice folks at prefix.dev asked me to help them develop the rattler package manager, and there is lots to tell about what we have achieved since then, so buckle up!</description>
