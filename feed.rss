      <description>AWS has a lot of haters. Lots of horror cases where people thought they were on the free account but ended up with a $20,000 bill. We are told Azure has a much better model. You have to manually move to a paid service. No surprise bills. Like AWS,</description>

      <description>AWS Lambda provides a serverless compute service that can scale from a single request to hundreds of thousands per second. When designing your application, especially for high load, it helps to understand how Lambda handles scaling and throughput. There are two components to consider: concurrency and transactions per second. Concurrency of a system is the […]</description>

      <title>SATAn: Air-Gap Exfiltration Attack via Radio Signals From SATA Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07413</link>
      <description>This paper introduces a new type of attack on isolated, air-gapped
workstations. Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show
that attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio
signals at the 6 GHz frequency band. The Serial ATA (SATA) is a bus interface
widely used in modern computers and connects the host bus to mass storage
devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. The
prevalence of the SATA interface makes this attack highly available to
attackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments. We discuss
related work on this topic and provide technical background. We show the design
of the transmitter and receiver and present the implementation of these
components. We also demonstrate the attack on different computers and provide
the evaluation. The results show that attackers can use the SATA cable to
transfer a brief amount of sensitive information from highly secured, air-gap
computers wirelessly to a nearby receiver. Furthermore, we show that the attack
can operate from user mode, is effective even from inside a Virtual Machine
(VM), and can successfully work with other running workloads in the background.
Finally, we discuss defense and mitigation techniques for this new air-gap
attack.</description>

      <title>Building friend catchers</title>
      <link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/friendcatchers/</link>
      <description>As a 13 year old, my dad’s advice on internet presence was:
 “Everything you post will be used against you in the future. So you should never associate your name with anything on the internet”.
 As a rebellious teenager my view was the opposite:
 “Everything you post on the internet will get lost. You should associate your real name with everything you find interesting”
 I think looking back, this might be the most useful lesson I learned from my high school years.</description>

      <description>Note: This is not meant to be a tutorial or a guide, it&amp;#39;s more a story of my journey while building something. A story in which I will try to show the decisions that I made and why I made them. Talk about errors I encountered and the unknowns that caused me problems. In case you want to make a decision based on this post, I would highly suggest you first do your own research, and also talk to people with way more experience than me.</description>
