      <title>.NET Rocks! The Observability Tipping Point with Steve Gordon and Martin Thwaites</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1887</link>
      <description>Has observability hit a tipping point? Carl and Richard chat with Steve Gordon and Martin Thwaites about the various products and technologies today to make observability a vital part of a successful application. Steve talks about telemetry support hitting a tipping point where most vendors have products working with OpenTelemetry. Martin digs into the many places you can send telemetry to increase your understanding of how your applications work on-premises and in the cloud. It&amp;#39;s an exciting time to build cloud-native - are you on board?</description>

      <description>Today marks 10 years since my first pull request to the Rust compiler. Though I’m no open source legend, to me it’s an important date still. As I’ve mentioned in the past, my involvement in Rust was pivotal to my development as a software engineer, so I can’t let this day pass without a mention in my blog!
How did it happen that I, a bored student yearning to learn interesting stuff, ended up contributing to Rust?</description>

      <description>VLC wasn’t born like other media players.
                  It wasn’t cooked up in some Silicon Valley tech-giant’s lab,
                  fed on venture capital, and released into the world like a
                  pampered prince. VLC is more of a phoenix, rising from the
                  ashes of a French academic project from the bygone days of
                  1996, known as the VideoLAN project.
                
                  In the beginning, VLC was just a client, a humble part of the
                  grand scheme known as VideoLAN. The “VideoLAN Client” they
                  called it, before its baptism as VLC. Imagine it — a kid
                  trying to fit into a world that hadn’t yet recognized its
                  value. VLC was a rebel, designed to stream videos from
                  satellite dishes across a university campus. It was a tool
                  created by students, not corporations, out of necessity rather
                  than for profit.</description>

      <title>State of the Terminal | g.p. anders</title>
      <link>https://gpanders.com/blog/state-of-the-terminal/</link>
      <description>This is a companion article to my talk at Neovimconf 2023.

I’ve spent a lot of time in the terminal and have become very aware of the many flaws and idiosyncrasies of this bizarre platform. But I also think it gets a lot of things right! And I’m not alone in this belief: terminal based tools are still widely popular even in the presence of many alternatives (the StackOverflow developer survey shows that Neovim is the “most loved” editor 3 years in a row).</description>
