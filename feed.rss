      <link>https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/introducing-observable-plot</link>
      <description>No pie charts were harmed in the making of this logo. We are thrilled to announce Observable Plot, a new open-source JavaScript library for exploratory data visualization. Observable’s mission is to help everyone make sense of the world with data. To succeed, we need to make visualization easier and faster, both to learn and to practice. Less chore, more joy. We believe people will be more successful finding and communicating insights if they can “use vision to think” instead of wrestling with the</description>

      <description>Over the past couple months, I’ve spent several hundred bucks on sponsoring newsletters. It’s an interesting format. Instead of targeting via algorithm (as in FB/Google ads), you target by picking newsletters with relevant topics. I kind of like it.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;I work on ads at Google&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Can I ask why? I honestly can&amp;#39;t understand how anyone could.&amp;quot;  Someone recently asked me why I work on ads, and I wanted to write up something more thorough than my comment. (Despite being a work topic this is a personal post and I&amp;#39;m speaking only for myself.)  One answer is that I&amp;#39;m earning to give: I give half of what I earn to the most effective charities I can find,</description>

      <description>If you follow the tech scene in any way, you will not have missed the ongoing self-immolation of the company Basecamp.
First, if you want to read an in-depth overview of what happened, Casey Newton has written two well-sourced reports on what happened, neither of which seems to be disputed in any meaningful way by any of the participants:
 What really happened at Basecamp How Basecamp blew up  I will delve into what seems to have happened towards the end of this post but this crisis is interesting because it is a good case study of mismanagement, even without knowing any of the internal details.</description>

      <description>In February 1946, President Truman directed his intelligence apparatus to prepare a daily summary of critical national security issues. The President’s Daily Brief (“PDB”) has been produced ever since, and those that have been made public illustrate the breadth and complexity of the threats facing our nation. For example, in 1962, while President Kennedy dealt […]</description>

      <description>My father’s father was by all accounts a really bitter-hearted sort of person. I say “by all accounts” because I hardly knew him; he had at some point prior to my birth disowned my dad over a matter of money - he wanted to borrow a large amount of money for something my father considered ill advised, and my dad wouldn’t loan it. He wouldn’t talk to him for decades; choking to death from emphysema, his last words to my dad were “Tell him he owes me $50,000”.</description>
