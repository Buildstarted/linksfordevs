So, as I was working on Wizard-Vicuna-30b-Uncensored and WizardLM-Uncensored-Falcon-7b, I came to the realization that these models, despite being trained with no refusals, were still refusing. How could thi...</description>

      <title>You don&amp;#39;t take enough risks to be lucky</title>

      <description>I quit my job a month ago, which will probably end up among the best turning points of my career. To be clear, there was nothing wrong with that job, the alternative is just that much better. My social and professional networks have grown dramatically. I have the most intellectual</description>

      <title>Developer Brethren, its Time to Embrace Boring!</title>
      <link>https://jaylittle.com/post/view/2023/6/developer-brethren-its-time-to-embrace-boring</link>
      <description>So this morning I was listening to one of the Linux related podcasts, Coder Radio and the hosts read feedback from a listener who claimed that he was &amp;amp;quot;bored&amp;amp;quot; with PHP and ready to try something else.  Now to be fair, in this particular case, the writer outlined some circumstances that made me sympathize with him.  Long story short is that parts of the PHP based stack he was relying on for some of his software had changed significantly.  In order to update his software to a currently supported version of PHP, he basically now has to rewrite it from scratch.  So yeah, that sucks.</description>

      <title>6 Reasons You Don&amp;#39;t Need an SRE Team</title>
      <link>https://log.andvari.net/6reasons.html</link>
      <description>The last several years have seen a huge upsurge in the popularity of the DevOps/SRE/Production Engineering model, with companies large and small adopting some of the practices and mindsets. One of the principal lessons many of these organisations (hopefully) learned was that it&amp;#39;s close to impossible to adopt the SRE model as described by Google in the the first SRE book. It&amp;#39;s a good approach to take on board the parts of the book that work for you, and to actively triage your time, energy and effort.</description>

      <description>In addition to the ChatGPT application, OpenAI has also released APIs that allow you to integrate it in your products. Confusingly, Microsoft has also released something called Azure OpenAI Service, which appears to be doing the same.</description>
