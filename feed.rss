      <title>Tim Cook vs. Steve Jobs</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/8/2.html</link>
      <description>On Friday I published a glowing book review of Apple in China by Patrick McGee. Coincidentally, on the same day UnHerd published an article by Patrick McGee, Time is running out for Tim Cook: Apple lacks strategic vision. I continue to admire McGee’s reporting, continue to recommend his book, and this new article hasn’t changed my mind about that. However, reporters who have made a name for themselves have a tendency to want to become commentators, to add their opinions to their factual reporting. In my own opinion, the opinions of reporters are no better than anyone else’s opinion. The ability to get quality news scoops doesn’t automatically make someone superior at analyzing the implications of that news. Another example of this phenomenon is Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, a prolific source of Apple leaks, unparalleled in tech reporting history; I salute his uncanny prowess as a reporter. Nonetheless, his opinions are pedestrian at best, ill-advised at worst, and I find it regrettable that Gurman’s articles sometimes muddy the distinction between his leaks and his opinions.</description>

      <link>https://www.thepourquoipas.com/post/openai-needs-adult-supervision</link>
      <description>Whether from ambition, arrogance or lack of discipline, OpenAI is in trouble today. The company must overcome significant internal and market issues if it is to survive the coming years.
A handful of fault‑lines will determine the outcome. Any structural weakness surrounding these foundational elements of AI’s present and future could burst ambitions that may very well have already reached bubble territory.</description>

A side-note, I recently started working at the New Zealand Meteorological Service (MetService)... So the title is a double joke...</description>

      <description>Back in 2012, the Happy Eyeballs RFC 6555 was published. It details how a sensible Internet client should proceed when connecting to a server. It basically goes like this: Give the IPv6 attempt priority, then with a delay start a separate IPv4 connection in parallel with the IPv6 one; then use the connection that succeeds … Continue reading Even happier eyeballs →</description>

      <title>The hollow universe</title>
      <link>https://www.jonoalderson.com/misc/the-hollow-universe/</link>
      <description>The year is 2237. The universe is quiet. The worlds we used to visit are still there, but no one comes. They don’t know why. They don’t know what they did wrong.</description>

      <title>How OpenAI Is Turning Monopoly Money Into Real Debt</title>
      <link>https://saturn.land/monopoly-money.html</link>
      <description>OpenAI is playing Monopoly with Monopoly money, and everyone's pretending the bills are real. The company just dropped $6.5 billion in stock—not cash, stock—to acquire io, Jony Ive's hardware startup that hasn't shown so much as a napkin sketch. They're about to blow another $3 billion on Windsurf, a coding assistant that's essentially Microsoft Copilot's twin brother. And then there's Stargate: a $500 billion fever dream where OpenAI promises to invest $19 billion of the same funny money for the privilege of paying Oracle $30 billion annually starting in 2028.</description>
