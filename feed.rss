      <title>Impact As A Developer: Visibility To Your Manager - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=WbLjANjugsc</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s unfortunate, but there&amp;#39;s often a rift between developers and their managers.

Is there enough visibility into the impact that&amp;#39;s being delivered? How can we improve it? And what if my manager is new?!

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>Understanding Cursor Pagination and Why It&amp;#39;s So Fast (Deep Dive)</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/understanding-cursor-pagination-and-why-its-so-fast-deep-dive</link>
      <description>While offset pagination is widely used, cursor-based pagination offers significant performance advantages - my tests show a 17x speedup when paginating through a million-record dataset in PostgreSQL. Let&amp;#39;s take a deep dive into cursor pagination, compare it with offset pagination, and examine the SQL execution plans.</description>

      <title>Emjay - a simple JIT that does math</title>
      <link>https://andreabergia.com/blog/2025/02/emjay-a-simple-jit-that-does-math/</link>
      <description>Today I wanna show off my most recent little project, called emjay. It’s a very simple “language”, with an evaluator that generates JIT code and executes it. It does not have a “normal” interpreter, only the JIT compiler. The language is extremely limited, but that was intentional, since I wanted something simple that I could write end-to-end. All the code is written in Rust and it is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/andreabergia/emjay. It’s roughly 4k lines of code including tests, so it is small enough to be presented in this post.</description>

      <description>Can an open-source MQTT broker handle one million messages per second for persistent sessions? TBMQ 2.x proves it can! Even more importantly, it achieves this with no single point of failure and ensures no data loss, even when hardware fails, making it a robust self-hosted MQTT broker solution for IIoT applications.

      <title>Why Is Everyone Obsessed With Chat Interfaces?</title>
      <link>https://zehfernandes.com/posts/why-is-everyone-obsessed-with-chat-interfaces</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about this: why does every app, tool, and platform seem to be adding a chat interface? I get it — chat is powerful. You can freely ask for something and get results fast. But as an interface designer, I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that products are forgetting an important lesson. It&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re just slapping a chat box onto everything and calling it a day. And honestly, that feels off.</description>

      <description>Someone asked me the other day what it would take to surprise me. In other words, given the deluge of data coming in from all kinds of observatories, what one bit of news would set me back on my heels? That took some reflection. Would it surprise me, my interlocutor persisted, if SETI fails to find another civilization in my lifetime?</description>
