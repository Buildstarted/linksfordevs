      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=c84HLGqP8Wg</link>
      <description>What does it take to be a Tech Lead in software engineering? I sat down with Anemari Fiser to discuss!

We dug into:
- What is a tech lead?
- How to move into the role?
- How do soft skills fit into the picture?

Thanks so much for the perspective, Anemari!

I boosted several posts about this already, but since people keep asking if I've seen it....

MITRE has announced that its funding for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program and related programs, including the Common Weakness Enumeration Program, will expire on April 16. The CVE database is critical for anyone doing vulnerability management or security research, and for a whole lot of other uses. There isn't really anyone else left who does this, and it's typically been work that is paid for and supported by the US government, which is a major consumer of this information, btw.

I reached out to MITRE, and they confirmed it is for real. Here is the contract, which is through the Department of Homeland Security, and has been renewed annually on the 16th or 17th of April.

https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001

MITRE's CVE database is likely going offline tomorrow. They have told me that for now, historical CVE records will be available at GitHub, https://github.com/CVEProject

Yosry Barsoum, vice president and director at MITRE's Center for Securing the Homeland, said:

“On Wednesday, April 16, 2025, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) Program, will expire.  The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.”</description>

      <description>MITRE’s 25-year-old Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program will end April 16 after DHS did not renew its funding contract for reasons unspecified. Experts say ending the program, which served as the crux for most cybersecurity defense programs, is a tragedy.</description>

      <title>Four weeks of voice computing - here's what I learnt</title>
      <link>https://www.fileside.app/blog/2025-04-14_voice-computing/</link>
      <description>After a recent flare-up of RSI-related wrist pain, I decided to make a serious attempt at becoming proficient at speech computing. My hope was to be able to add an alternative input method in order to offload my hands, and allow them some rest even during my daily work. I’m now four weeks in and this post summarises my impressions. The journey has had its fair share of frustrations, but also brought some surprising insights.</description>
