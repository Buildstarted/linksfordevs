      <title>What is the difference between C#, .NET, IL and JIT?</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/aa23a1c9-8ab2-4b05-9bd2-52624af7b684</link>
      <description>When you get started or even if you have quite some knowledge it can be confusing to juggle with those terms.
So what is the difference between C# and .NET? And what does it have to do with IL and JIT?

      <title>Testing Azure Private Endpoints DNS resolution over an Azure P2S VPN connection</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/testing-private-dns-resolution-over-a-p2s-vpn-using-azure-dns-private-resolver/</link>
      <description>The purpose of this post is to try out the new Azure DNS Private Resolver resource. To test it, we&amp;#39;re going to try to solve one of the current issues that Azure VPN has right now: when connected over an Azure P2S VPN the private DNS zone resolution does not work. This becomes quite problematic when you&amp;#39;re using private endpoints to secure some private resources, because there is no easy way to resolve the private endpoint DNS when connected to a P2S VPN.</description>

      <description>Digital Minimalism A few days after I have started working on this post, I begun reading Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism book and quickly realized how both topics interrelate to each other. But now one by one:
 Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your entire time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities to strongly support things you value and happily miss out everything else.</description>

      <title>Why Vim syntax highlighting breaks sometimes</title>
      <link>https://dev-nonsense.com/posts/vim-syntax-highlighting/</link>
      <description>Vim was my preferred text editor for nearly eighteen years, until I switched to aretext in 2021. I appreciated vim’s efficiency and ubiquity, the way I could rely on it regardless of what project I was working on or what machine I had ssh’d into. Like any software, however, vim reflects the time in which it was written. In many cases, vim optimizes for speed above all else, an approach that made sense given the limitations of late ’90s computers.</description>

      <description>Redis is one of the super-cool pieces of software that I&amp;#39;ve always admired. Recently, I got curious about the algorithm behind expiring keys in Redis. I&amp;#39;ve used the TTL feature in Redis, quite a lot but never digged deeper to understand the concept behind it.</description>
