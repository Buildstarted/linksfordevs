      <title>The Problem with MTTR: Learning from Incident Reports</title>
      <link>https://devinterrupted.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-mttr-learning-from</link>
      <description>Tracking Mean Time To Restore (MTTR) is standard industry practice for incident response and analysis, but should it be? Courtney Nash, an Internet Incident Librarian, argues that MTTR is not a reliable metric - and we think she&amp;#39;s got a point. We caught up with Courtney at the DevOps Enterprise Summit in Las Vegas, where she was making her case against MTTR in favor of alternative metrics (SLOs and cost of coordination data), practices (Near Miss analysis), and mindsets (humans are the solution, not the problem) to help organization better learn from their incidents.</description>

      <title>Layoffs, Anxiety and Trust</title>
      <link>https://www.mikemcbrideonline.com/2023/02/layoffs-anxiety-and-trust/</link>
      <description>Ultimately this is what will define your culture and your employee engagement. Do your actions match your words? It&amp;#39;s not enough to say you care about mental health, diversity, or developing the people who work for you. You had better put something behind that. If you&amp;#39;ve had layoffs recently, don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to believe that you care about these things on your words alone. Those layoffs told everyone in the organization that they were expendable. They could be next, and the only thing that truly matters is how much they make for you. If you care about their growth, wellbeing and being a diverse company, you had better show up with something other than words.</description>

This is a classic CSS trick that relies on the fact that Firefox lets you apply CSS to a page by including […]</description>

      <title>A Guide to Reclaim Our Attention</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/a-guide-to-reclaim-our-attention/</link>
      <description>We’re losing our capacity to focus.

iPhone presentation in 2007
And we loved it.
We’ve embraced smartphones to the point where it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t own one, but we have yet to consider the consequences.</description>

      <title>52 Factorial</title>
      <link>https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html</link>
      <description>They seem harmless enough, 52 thin slices of laminated cardboard with colorful designs printed on their sides.  Yet, as another illustration of the mantra that complexity begins from the most simple systems, the number of variations that these 52 cards can produce is virtually endless.  The richness of most playing card games owes itself to this fact.</description>
