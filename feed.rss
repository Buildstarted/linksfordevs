      <title>Powering Up with Erik Jensen: An Introduction to EF Core Power Tools</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=HBgVkellxE4</link>
      <description>Metalama This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by Metalama, reduce your boilerplate code by up to 15% with Metalama&amp;#39;s C#-to-C# template engine and reduce your code complexity today!

 Show Notes Hi everyone,

 Just a quick thing before we start: this episode was recorded in the middle of summer, which meant that Erik needed to have his office window open. It&amp;#39;s possible to hear the outside traffic throughout, but rest assured that our editing team have done what they can to reduce it&amp;#39;s presence.

 It&amp;#39;s not that noticable and shouldn&amp;#39;t affect your enjoyment of the show, but I wanted to give you a heads-up. Also, do remember that there&amp;#39;s a full transcription available at the show&amp;#39;s website; so check that out, too.

 Anyway, let&amp;#39;s get to it.

 &amp;quot;So, I think my mantra for creating things like these tools is, &amp;quot;should be easy to get started and there should be a like an easy happy path but then if you want to deep dive and do a lot of options or even a t4 templates you can also do that,&amp;quot; but there should be a simple happy path with good error reporting if something fails.&amp;quot;— Erik Jensen

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focussing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie &amp;quot;GaProgMan&amp;quot; Taylor.

 In this episode, Erik Jensen joined us to talk about EF Core Power Tools, and how you can use his project to increase your productivity with EF Core-based databases, regardless of the database technology used; if it&amp;#39;s supported by EF Core, then the Power Tools extension supports it to.

 &amp;quot;The one that&amp;#39;s definitely used the most is what in a tool is referred to as reverse engineering. Where you point to an existing database, which can be some of the database types I mentioned previously. Like SQL Server, as a SQL database, Postgres, Oracle, MySQL, and Firebird. And then the tool asks you for a number of options, like you can specify what namespaces you&amp;#39;re using, and where the files are laid in your project, and many, many other options. And then when you press OK at that point, as you said, Jamie, the tool generates a DB context and some classes that represent your tables with navigations between the tables based on discovery of foreign key relationships.&amp;quot;— Erik Jensen

 We also briefly touched on the MSBuild.Sdk.SqlProj project and its goal of giving cross-platform .NET developers a way to both describe and build their ideal database schema in code. We also covered Erik&amp;#39;s personal process for dealing with feature requests, and how developers can ensure that that are providing valueable feedback to open-source projects; a subject that will come up again soon with future guest Scott Harden.

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <title>Building a better and scalable system for data migrations</title>
      <link>https://yorickpeterse.com/articles/building-a-better-and-scalable-system-for-data-migrations/</link>
      <description>Recently I read about a new Rust web framework called
rwf. I was especially curious about its approach
to handling database migrations, as many frameworks released in recent years
tend to either overlook this or provide a mechanism that won&amp;#39;t scale to larger
projects. Reading through the documentation I learned that rwf falls in the
second category: it generates two SQL files, one for migrating forward and one
for migrating backwards, and evaluates the appropriate files based on the
migration direction.</description>
