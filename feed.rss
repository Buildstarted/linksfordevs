      <description>One of the challenges with developing cross platform apps for iOS, Android, Windows, Web, Linux etc is that at some point you’re inevitably going to need to spend some time focusing on each individual platform.

      <link>https://www.renehersecycles.com/12-myths-in-cycling-1-wider-tires-are-slower/</link>
      <description>When we started to publish Bicycle Quarterly 15 years ago, it seemed that most of the technical aspects of bicycles were well-established. And yet, as we tested many different bikes, we started to question many of the things we had accepted as ‘facts.’ To celebrate our 15th anniversary, we’ll look at some of these myths. We’ll explain why we (and everybody else) used to believe them, and how things really work. Let’s start this series with the biggest one:</description>

      <title>Bye bye Travis CI | daniel.haxx.se</title>
      <link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/06/14/bye-bye-travis-ci/</link>
      <description>In the afternoon of October 17, 2013 we merged the first config file ever that would use Travis CI for the curl project using the nifty integration at GitHub. This was the actual introduction of the entire concept of building and testing the project on every commit and pull request for the curl project. Before this merge happened, we only had our autobuilds. They are systems run by volunteers that update the code from git maybe once per day, build and run the tests and then upload all the logs.</description>

 In part 1 I will talk about some key concepts that you should know when creating a .NET template. In part 2 I will show you the process of converting a .NET app into a .NET template.

      <description>Diagnostics has always been a fundamental part of the .NET development experience. It enables developers to understand the runtime behavior of their programs, at both a high- and low-level. It’s also the set of tools that developers reach for to root-cause a failure and resolve it.</description>
