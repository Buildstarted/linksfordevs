      <title>Hyper-Typing</title>
      <link>https://pscanf.com/s/341/</link>
      <description>
In this article, I talk about an inherent trade-off in TypeScript's type
system: stricter types are safer, but often more complex. I describe a
phenomenon I call "hyper-typing", where libraries - in pursuit of perfect type
safety - end up with overly complex types that are hard-to-understand, produce
cryptic errors, and paradoxically even lead to unsafe workarounds.


I argue that simpler types, or even type generation, often lead to a more
practical and enjoyable developer experience despite being less "perfect".

      <link>https://jchandra.com/posts/hyperparameter-optimisation/</link>
      <description>When you hear hyperparameter tuning, you might think of trying lots of different model settings to find the best one‚Äîmaybe using grid search, random search, or some fancy algorithm. But when you‚Äôre doing this at scale, especially with limited time or compute, it‚Äôs not just about finding the best settings. It‚Äôs about how you manage your resources. You have a bunch of models to try, but you can‚Äôt run them all fully.</description>

      <description>I left my career in big tech in July of 2023 to try my hand at entrepreneurship. I had just turned 31 and figured if I didn‚Äôt take the chance now, I was probably never going to. On a risk-adjusted basis, it‚Äôs been a horrible financial decision. However, it‚Äôs also been the most professionally fulfilled I‚Äôve ever been in my life, and if we succeed in executing on our vision, the financial payoff could make it even better.</description>
