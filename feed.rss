      <title>ongoing by Tim Bray · Just Too Efficient</title>
      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient</link>
      <description>On a Spring 2019
    walk in Beijing I saw two street sweepers
    at a sunny corner. They were beat-up looking and grizzled but probably younger than me. They’d paused
    work to smoke and talk. One told a story; the other’s eyes widened and then he laughed so hard he had to
    bend over, leaning on his broom.  I suspect their jobs and pay were lousy and their lives constrained in ways I can’t
    imagine. But they had time to smoke a cigarette and crack a joke. You know what that’s called? Waste,
    inefficiency, a suboptimal outcome. Some of the brightest minds in our economy are earnestly engaged in stamping it
    out. They’re winning, but everyone’s losing.</description>

      <description>A variable is an abstraction.
In maths, it could represent an unknown, a to be calculated entity or a changing quantity. In programming, it could represent a number, a character/string, a function, an object, or the changing state of a part of a system. It's an interface to some hidden logic the details of which are irrelevant to the current context in which it is being used. God knows what behemoth of complexity it contains or how it has been implemented. Probably a complex data structure or some algorithm that you never cared to learn in college. 😉</description>
