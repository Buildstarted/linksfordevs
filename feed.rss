      <title>Launching Visual Studio Code cleanly from a .NET Application</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Sep/03/Launching-VS-Code-cleanly-from-a-NET-Application</link>
      <description>Visual Studio Code has become the mainstay editor for many developers. If you have developer focused applications and you need to externally display text or code content, it would be very useful to pop open VS Code to display external text/code content. This sounds simple enough, but Code both on Windows and Mac has some peculiar launch behaviors that make this a little more tricky than you might think, especially if you need to make sure that you can do it across platforms. </description>

      <title>Snowball sampling bias in program evaluation</title>
      <link>https://bldavies.com/blog/snowball-sampling-bias-program-evaluation/</link>
      <description>Suppose I want to run a pilot study of a mental health support program before rolling it out at scale.
The program has heterogeneous treatment effects, but tends to be more effective for people who have fewer social connections.
Such people tend to have lower mental health (Kawachi and Berkman, 2001) and so have more to gain from participating in the program.</description>

      <description>In tech, switching jobs almost always comes with either a financial or a title upside. However, it doesn’t always come with both. Switching for higher compensation can result in a “lower” title, like going from Senior Software Engineer to SWE 2 or VP Engineering to Senior Engineering Manager. This</description>

      <description>Ok, I have to admit that the provided instructions aren’t bad at all. They actually state (most) of the required steps to do this, with a couple key missing pieces that caused me some trouble and resulted in quite a few trial-and-error attempts. I’m writing this down for my own future reference and hopefully it will save you some time too. Why First, why is any of this needed at all? Well, basically, at the time of this writing, neither .NET 5 nor .NET 6 are officially supported in Azure Functions. This means there isn’t a simple dropdown to just...</description>
