      <title>How Not to Store Passwords</title>
      <link>https://pboyd.io/posts/how-not-to-store-passwords/</link>
      <description>Here’s a fun list to look through: Dumb Password
Rules. Most of the
rules seem arbitrary, like only allowing digits, but some hint at deeper
problems. For instance, preventing single-quotes. They aren’t inserting
passwords into a database without a SQL placeholder, right? Nearly every site
on that list has a needlessly short maximum password size. If they’re storing
passwords correctly, there’s no need for this. This post will go through a few
bad ways to store a password and you can see what I mean.</description>
