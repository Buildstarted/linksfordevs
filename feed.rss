      <title>Counting Bytes Faster Than You’d Think Possible</title>
      <link>https://blog.mattstuchlik.com/2024/07/21/fastest-memory-read.html</link>
      <description>Summing ASCII Encoded Integers on Haswell at the Speed of memcpy turned out more popular than I expected, which inspired me to take on another challenge on HighLoad: Counting uint8s. I’m currently only #13 on the leaderboard, ~7% behind #1, but I already learned some interesting things. In this post I’ll describe my complete solution (skip to that) including a surprising memory read pattern that achieves up to ~30% higher transfer rates on fully memory bound, single core workloads compared to naive sequential access, while apparently not being widely known (skip to that).</description>

      <description>It’s 2 AM, and I’m staring at my screen, bleary-eyed and frustrated. The CI pipeline has failed for the third time tonight. I’ve spent the last week writing tests for a feature so small, I’m not even sure anyone will notice it. As I sip my cold coffee, a thought creeps in: “Is this really what being a software engineer is all about?”</description>

      <title>Database Design for Google Calendar: a tutorial</title>

      <description>Author: Alexey Makhotkin squadette@gmail.com.
Introduction In this database design tutorial (~9000 words) I’m going to show how to design the database tables for a real-world project of substantial complexity.
We’ll design a clone of Google Calendar.&amp;#160;We will model as much as possible of the functionality that is directly related to the calendar.
This series illustrates an approach explained in the book called “Database Design using Minimal Modeling”, scheduled to be released in Summer 2024.</description>
