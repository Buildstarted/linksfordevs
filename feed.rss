      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2022/10/06/unless-youre-in-the-mafia-your-company-isnt-your-family/</link>
      <description>Dedication to your employer is a tradition in some cultures. My father was a dedicated coal miner and when the mine closed up he became a factory worker. He worked 40+ years in that factory in three shifts. He kept complaining about “those up there” in the hierarchy and yet the company was a big part of his life. He was always interested in what the company did even long after he retired.</description>

      <title>DIY out-of-band management: remote power button</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-10-09-remote-power-button/</link>
      <description>I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to make it possible to push a PC’s power button remotely via MQTT by wiring up an ESP32 microcontroller, a MOSFET, a resistor, and a few jumper wires.
While a commercial solution like IPMI offers many more features like remote serial, or remote image mounting, this DIY solution feels really magical, and has great price performance if all you need is power management.</description>

      <title>adhd-page</title>
      <link>https://decemberhunting.dev/adhd-page/</link>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I&amp;#39;d been to a social gathering with my girlfriend all day. Overworked and overwhelmed by the mental effort required to socialize, I sat down at my desk in the evening and tried to gather myself and do something I knew how to do: build a tool to mitigate the raging exhaustion and confusion I&amp;#39;m left with after trying and failing to seem &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; for an entire day. What came out, though, rather than a development plan, was a confused and scrambled mess of a short text interspersed with illustrations that I found to be reflective of my state of mind in that moment and, really, of the ADHD that I was diagnosed with as an adult and that I was at the time not taking any medication for. I decided to leave the text as-is.</description>
