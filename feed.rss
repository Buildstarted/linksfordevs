      <description>Marketers are prone to a prediction. You’ll find them in the annual tirade of trend decks. In the PowerPoint projections of self-proclaimed prophets. In the feeds of forecasters and futurists. To understand the extent of our forecasting fascination, I analysed the websites of three management consul</description>

      <description>Why the “frontend” vs “backend” engineering axis doesn't map well to engineers’ psychology. And how using just one division can lead to job mismatches, turnover, and even push some new grad engineers into product management.</description>

      <title>Ayodele Odubela - Combatting Bias in ML [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4PYKab0jIE</link>
      <description>In this talk I cover how to see the bias in your data and machine learning models. By giving examples from recent research on biased facial recognition systems as well as cutting edge explainability algorithms, attendees can expect clarification on what bias means in machine learning.

      <link>https://aseure.fr/articles/2020-09-18-dont-hate-the-book-because-you-dont-use-it/</link>
      <description>In a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Facebook Connect: John Carmack Unscripted Live [Archive]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXmY26pOE-Y</link>
      <description>We restreamed a direct feed of the Facebook Connect presentation offered by John Carmack at 5:30PM PT on Sept. 16, 2020. 

Don't forget to read our full review of the Oculus Quest 2 right here: https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-2-review/

00:00:00 John Carmack starts talking
00:03:03 “Global lockdown and pandemic..."
00:04:35 “Frankly I’m kind of embarrassed by our social story here…”
00:05:12 “Location-based VR has probably taken a terminal hit…”
00:06:00  "People are ok with making a sweaty mess in their own personal  headset..”
00:12:07 “Reality...just seamlessly flows into the simulation...”
00:14:06 “Quest 2 is better, faster, cheaper, and we’re making a ton more of them..."
00:14:54 “"Resolution is 3664x1920...”
00:16:33 “You could start doing some real work with it..."
00:18:34 “Best display that we’ve ever had..."
00:31:29 “Still haven’t announced a full wireless connection system for Link...we should have some kind of an Air Link”
00:32:47 Qualcomm XR2
00:59:12 “Whatever the next headset is we’ve got to get higher resolution on the tracking cameras.”
01:00:45 “We did look at this for the latter days of Gear VR, doing this kind of two part plug-in instead of drop-in, and there may still be some useful things to go there.”
01:00:59 “There are still some things for which Go is the best headset”
01:02:04 “Putting on the headset should be as seamless as answering a phone call…”
1:02:31 “Having things converged now on our VR platforms is an enormous relief..."
1:03:12 “This low-powered gaming focused device which wasn’t really what anybody was aiming for at the beginning…”
1:05:17 “Getting the more inexpensive systems out on VR is critical..."
1:08:47 “Maybe you have a controller-free SKU where the controllers are more expensive but they never lose tracking…”
1:12:06 “It is all about the headset learning to understand the world around it…”
1:18:41 “Our push to be a general purpose computing system…”
1:19:40 “We need more Android applications…”
1:21:40 “I think I’m about done here…"

      <description>I’ve been using Azure Cosmos DB on a fairly regular basis for the last 2 years or so. It’s a pretty good database, but one thing has always bothered me: the lack of a proper tool to query and modify data in the database. Basically, here are the current options:
 The standalone Cosmos DB Explorer website The Data Explorer in the Azure Portal Cosmos DB support in Azure Storage Explorer  These 3 options are actually the same thing, made from the same code base, which was recently open-sourced.</description>
