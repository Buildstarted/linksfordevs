      <title>PrivEsc: Abusing the Service Control Manager for Stealthy &amp;amp; Persistent LPE</title>
      <link>https://0xv1n.github.io/posts/scmanager/</link>
      <description>Living off the Land Earlier this week, Grzegorz Tworek posted a really cool way of establishing a persistent LPE that I haven’t previously seen in the wild. From a (compromised) privileged account we can abuse the Service Control Manager to allow any arbitrary non-administrative user to have full SYSTEM permissions on a machine persistently by feeding an overly permissive ACL to the service control manager with sdset.
Some background knowledge Understanding what this attack is doing will require some light reading into both sdset as well as Microsoft’s Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL).</description>

      <link>https://www.rajatswarup.com/blog/2023/03/08/the-historical-evolution-of-cross-site-request-forgery/</link>
      <description>Having been in application security for more than 2 decades now and officially completing my 18th year now of being meaningfully employed in that space there is just a lot of crud that I have gathered in my brain.  Most of that is history of how things came about to be.  That stuff is likely not interesting to most but I find it intriguing as to how some seemingly minor decisions of one software vendor can have massive impact to the web application security industry.</description>

      <title>How platform integration in Qt/KDE apps works</title>
      <link>https://nicolasfella.de/posts/how-platform-integration-works/</link>
      <description>There has been some recent discussions about how KDE applications (or Qt apps in general) should look and feel like outside of the Plasma desktop, particularly in a GNOME environment.
During this discussion I noticed two major disconnects between the involved parties. One of them is technical in nature, where (understandably) not everyone involved has deep knowledge about how Qt and KDE apps work. The other one is cultural in nature, where there’s opposing views about who gets to decide how an application should look and feel like on a given platform.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! The Inflection Point of Large Language Models with Grant Barrett</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1836</link>
      <description>ChatGPT, BingAI, and Google Bard are the latest examples of large language model machine learning - are we at an inflection point in technology? Carl and Richard talk to Grant Barrett of A Way with Words about the power of these new technologies to solicit reactions from many folks, including many tech journalists. Grant talks about how language conveys a sense of intelligence even when there is none to be had and the problems created by those assumptions. It is still the early days for these chatbots - will they rapidly improve or fade into another AI winter?</description>
