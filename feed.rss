      <link>https://randsinrepose.com/archives/minimum-viable-curiousity/</link>
      <description>I was in the city a few weeks ago and exclusively used Waymo for the entire trip. My biggest complaint? I needed to walk four minutes to a pick-up spot. Other than that, the car just showed up, traversed San Francisco streets easily, and the cost was reasonable1.  Sitting in the back seat watching t</description>

      <title>Alexa, shame on you</title>
      <link>https://kg.dev/thoughts/alexa</link>
      <description>I don‚Äôt ask much of Alexa. I really don‚Äôt."Alexa, all lights on""Alexa, next song""Alexa, weather"And somehow, it still manages to baffle me with how poorly it performs. Five years ago, I saw this thing as magical. Somehow, it was able to take my voice from across the room, convert it into a command, and do what I wanted it to do most of the time. But times have changed.Today, we have large language models which can write hundreds of lines of working code, understand voice with near-perfect accuracy, and actually generate audio waves instead of just using text-to-speech. 4 years of incredible, mind-blowing advancements ‚Äì&amp;nbsp;and Alexa hasn‚Äôt changed a bit.Here is something that happened this morning:"Alexa, play the previous song again""Here is a song you recently played"I don‚Äôt know how Alexa works under the hood. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs very complicated and not something that can be upgraded easily, but it‚Äôs down right embarrassing that in this day and age, Alexa can‚Äôt play the previous song about half the time I ask it to. It fails to turn on/off all the lights in my apartment maybe a third of the time. It randomly disconnects from my smart home devices. I‚Äôve completely given up on trying to program a scene into it.I know I‚Äôm complaining a lot, but come on. We deserve better.Please, Amazon, fix Alexa.</description>

      <description>LLM agents make bad pairs because they code faster than humans think.
I'll admit, I've had a lot of fun using GitHub Copilot's agent mode in VS Code this month.‚Ä¶</description>
