      <description>According to Arizona Department of Corrections whistleblowers, hundreds of incarcerated people who should be eligible for release are being held in prison because the inmate management software cannot interpret current sentencing laws.KJZZ is not naming the whistleblowers because they fear retaliation. The employees said they have been raising the issue internally for more than a year, but prison administrators have not acted to fix the software bug. The sources said Chief Information Officer Holly Greene and Deputy Director Joe Profiri have been aware of the problem since 2019.</description>

syntax; it’s about doing useful stuff. And doing useful stuff is not always

      <title>A remote code execution vulnerability in qmail</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/820969/</link>
      <description>Just in case anybody out there is still using qmail: a remote code
execution vulnerability has just been disclosed.  Its CVE number is
CVE-2005-1513 because, as it turns out, the problem was reported 15 years
ago but the fix was refused by the maintainer.
&amp;quot;As a proof of concept, we developed a reliable, local and remote exploit
against Debian&amp;#39;s qmail package in its default configuration. This proof
of concept requires 4GB of disk space and 8GB of memory, and allows an
attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands as any user, except root
(and a few system users who do not own their home directory).&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>Thought Space vs Reality</title>
      <link>https://suketk.com/thought-space-vs-reality</link>
      <description>There are two worlds - the one in our head and the one that is real. It’s easy to conflate the two; perception is reality, the saying goes. But they are separate. Perception is just a representation of reality and as we know, the map is not the territory.</description>

      <title>Managing (side)projects - Bram&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://bram.dingelstad.works/blog/managing-side-projects/</link>
      <description>I’ve always had a soft spot for working on something that I thought was a good idea. I have loved the idea of being a little inventor since I was a kid. Being a programmer that gets to work on all kinds of systems or wants to build a lot of them, I found myself clutching this fantasy every single time when starting another project. But how do I make sense of them? Have I started too many? Why aren’t any of them finished? And why do I feel so demotivated to work on any of them, even though I really want to work on one?</description>

      <title>Tap your phone at Gold Coast bus stops to access my website</title>
      <link>https://joshwithers.blog/2021/02/22/tap-your-phone.html</link>
      <description>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.
That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?
So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</description>

      <title>The modern packager’s security nightmare – Michał G&amp;#243;rny</title>
      <link>https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/</link>
      <description>One of the most important tasks of the distribution packager is to ensure that the software shipped to our users is free of security vulnerabilities.  While finding and fixing the vulnerable code is usually considered upstream’s responsibility, the packager needs to ensure that all these fixes reach the end users ASAP.  With the aid of central package management and dynamic linking, the Linux distributions have pretty much perfected the deployment of security fixes.  Ideally, fixing a vulnerable dependency is as simple as patching a single shared library via the distribution’s automated update system.</description>
