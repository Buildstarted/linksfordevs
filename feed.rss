      <description>Apple wants to disallow Web Apps on iOS to be added to the home screen, run full screen and use the APIs necessary to create a great app. And to make things worse, only in Europe. We need to stop this from happening.</description>

      <title>WAKULLA RECEIPT MAP – Aaron Koelker</title>
      <link>https://aaronkoelker.com/wakulla-receipt-map/</link>
      <description>This map was designed to be printed on six feet of thermal receipt paper. Why on earth would anyone do that, you ask? After making a ribbon map of the Suwannee River, multiple people (jokingly?) suggested that I look into receipt printers when I explained how I needed to print the Suwannee map out in four sections. And the more I thought about it, the more that the idea of working within such absurd limitations sounded fun. So I created this map, and I’ll touch on all the things you might want to consider if you, too, want to print a map on thermal receipt printer. If you’re on mobile and want to skip to the full map, tap here.</description>

      <title>LLM Quantisation Weirdness :: Giles&amp;#39; blog</title>
      <link>https://www.gilesthomas.com/2024/02/llm-quantisation-weirdness</link>
      <description>I bought myself an Nvidia RTX 3090 for Christmas to play around with local AI
models.  Serious work needs larger, more powerful
cards, and it&amp;#39;s easy (and not that expensive) to rent such cards by the minute
from the likes of Paperspace.  But the way I see it, I&amp;#39;m not going to be
doing any serious work -- and what I really want to do is be able to run little experiments
quickly and easily without worrying about spinning up a machine, getting stuff
onto it, and so on.</description>

      <title>Choosing to Have Kids During the End Times — Stuff George Writes</title>
      <link>https://www.georgesaines.com/blog/2024/1/12/choosing-to-have-kids-during-the-end-times</link>
      <description>My best friend believes that humanity has a 60% probability of becoming extinct in the next 15 years. He’s one of the smartest people I know and is an extremely well-adjusted and high-functioning person. He scoffs at conspiracy theories, doesn’t wear tin foil hats, and has an abiding love of statistics. His belief is terrifying because it derives not from fevered information bubble YouTube binges, but from years of methodical research and predictions.</description>

      <title>The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764</link>
      <description>Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.</description>
