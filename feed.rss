If you read and write JSON or CSV files, you do this work all of the time.

      <title>Why I’m Losing Trust in Open Source – gibson.ws</title>
      <link>https://gibson.ws/why-im-losing-trust-in-open-source/</link>
      <description>Back when I was starting to code several years ago. I picked up The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond and I was blown away at the idea of free software. Just in case you are not familiar, free software as in freedom and not free beer. Free software back then was this super radical and idealistic concept where as you make a software product commercial or not, but when you distribute it you include the source code of it. The person who got your product would eventually continue to develop it and it will evolve and continually improve as it gets to many users. You then will be looking at their version of your product and will see how it has grown further. Think of it has a community garden where everyone grows their vegetable and anyone would then take pointers on some of your crops and grow their improved version. Eventually you’ll see where you are doing it wrong by looking at how they tend their garden. This is not necessarily free food for everyone – although it’s common. It’s freedom to copy and use my garden setup so we have bigger crops next harvest time.</description>

      <description>I love a lot of the thinking in functional programming (FP):


	Side-effect free functions - That they do not do hidden things beside doing work on the input and returning output
	Referential transparency of functions - A bit of the same as above, that what you put in to a function plus the function</description>

However, as computer programs evolve, so must the IDE keep pace to remain a useful tool. major IDE evolutions as I see:  2000s: using AST to represent text and building features around that. Intellij nailed this.  2010s:</description>

      <title>Prodoscore: The Bleak Future of Work</title>
      <link>https://blog.dennissauve.com/posts/2021-02-21_prodoscore-the-bleak-future-of-work/</link>
      <description>I recently took a sales pitch from Prodoscore at the behest of a colleague, and now I&amp;#39;m very concerned about
            the future of work. Much in the way that a poor (or even average) credit score can damage and ruin your
            chances
            at some opportunities, so too will a productivity score define your relative worth as an employee by
            reducing
            every aspect of your daily work life into a single number - your &amp;quot;Prodoscore&amp;quot;. The sales pitch of course was
            presented in a light of &amp;quot;helping employers identify &amp;#39;less productive&amp;#39; employees, and give transparency to
            team
            leaders on performance&amp;quot;. At least at first.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core in .NET 6 - Part 01 - Overview</title>
      <link>https://asp.net-hacker.rocks/2021/02/22/aspnetcore6-01.html</link>
      <description>.NET 5 was released just about 3 months age and Microsoft announced the first preview of .NET 6 last week. This is really fast. Actually they already started working on .NET 6 before version 5 was released. But it is anyway cool to have a preview available to start playing around. Also the ASP.NET team wrote a new blog post. It is about ASP.NET Core updates on .NET 6. I will take the chance to have more detailed look into the updates and the new feature. I&amp;#39;m going to start a series about those updates and features.</description>

      <description>According to Arizona Department of Corrections whistleblowers, hundreds of incarcerated people who should be eligible for release are being held in prison because the inmate management software cannot interpret current sentencing laws.KJZZ is not naming the whistleblowers because they fear retaliation. The employees said they have been raising the issue internally for more than a year, but prison administrators have not acted to fix the software bug. The sources said Chief Information Officer Holly Greene and Deputy Director Joe Profiri have been aware of the problem since 2019.</description>
