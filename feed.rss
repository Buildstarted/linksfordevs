      <description>Although Visual Studio and the dotnet CLI both offer clean commands, neither one *really* cleans up bin and obj files generated by the build process, and often things are left behind that cause problems. Here&amp;#39;s how to *really* remove all bin and obj folders recursively.</description>

      <title>Deep work. Essentialism in asynchronous culture</title>
      <link>https://jorzel.github.io/deep-work-essentialism-in-asynchronous-culture/</link>
      <description>Deep work
Nowadays, we are getting accustomed to working in a continuously interrupting environment. Smartphone notifications, hundreds of e-mails, open spaces, and meetings slicing our workday. We are feeling busy, and overworked, but are we more productive? 
If I am a salesman or project coordinator that way of working can bring good effects and even improve my skills. However, for Software Developers, Designers, and other professionals that need a quiet environment for creative effort, it can lead only to frustration and burnout. They need something that is called deep work. Deep work is a concept popularized by Cal Newport in his book under the same title published in 2016. The author divides mental activity into two categories:

  shallow work, that does not need intensive concentration like sending e-mails, formatting documents, chatting using communicators, etc.
  deep work, that demands distraction-free focus on one task like writing a document, learning a new skill, designing a software system, etc.

      <title>Blockchain Blasphemy and the Technological Antichrist</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/blockchain-blasphemy/</link>
      <description>There’s a meme YouTube video by Leonardo of Biz (here) where the villainous Bogs refer to their desire to attain something called “The Akashic Records” using blockchain technology.
This random aside not just shows the attention to detail Leonardo gives what would otherwise be silly videos, but articulates something deeply troubling about a war unfolding over Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain technology, but also technology generally.

      <description>Have you ever felt like the New Item Dialog slows you down when you want to quickly create an empty file or a simple C# class? Browsing through a list of templates is sometimes necessary, but wouldn’t it be great if Visual Studio could figure out which template you needed based only on the file name?</description>

      <title>What are the biggest reasons newcomers give up on OCaml?</title>
      <link>https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/what-are-the-biggest-reasons-newcomers-give-up-on-ocaml/10958/</link>
      <description>That’s probably not a good question to ask here, as most people here are surely people who persisted and made it (or are on the way there). But I’m still wondering what prevents OCaml from being more widely adopted as a language, and more, what made people who could have benefited from (and contributed to) OCaml give up.  My guess would be these three, in order of importance:   The compiler errors. Personally I think this is the biggest hurdle to get over with when learning OCaml. I wanted to gi...</description>
