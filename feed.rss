      <description>Important note: Some media coverage on this topic falsely or inaccurately depicts the attack conditions. To be clear: Any vulnerable device can be compromised if the attacker is in Bluetooth range. That is the only precondition.



During our research on Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, we identified several vulnerabilities in devices that incorporate Airoha Systems on a Chip (SoCs). In t ...</description>

      <title>Speed Up Django Queries with values() over only()</title>
      <link>https://johnnymetz.com/posts/django-values-over-only/</link>
      <description>If your Django queries feel slow, the problem might not be your database — it might be your ORM. Recently, I was working with a query that took 25 seconds to run through the Django ORM, but the underlying SQL completed in just 2 seconds. With a single change, I got the ORM query down to 2 seconds as well — and reduced the memory footprint by 70%.
Let’s walk through what happened, and why using .values() instead of .only() can dramatically improve performance.</description>

      <title>NVIDIA is full of shit</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebin-nyshkim.net/posts/nvidia-is-full-of-shit/</link>
      <description>Since the disastrous launch of the RTX 50 series, NVIDIA has been unable to escape negative headlines: scalper bots are snatching GPUs away from consumers before official sales even begin, power connectors continue to melt, with no fix in sight, marketing is becoming increasingly deceptive, GPUs are missing processing units when they leave the factory, and the drivers, for which NVIDIA has always been praised, are currently falling apart. And to top it all off, NVIDIA is becoming increasingly insistent that media push a certain narrative when reporting on their hardware.</description>

      <title>Intra: design notes on an LLM-driven text adventure</title>
      <link>https://ianbicking.org/blog/2025/07/intra-llm-text-adventure</link>
      <description>Last year I participated in a text adventure hackathon to build a text-based game using AI. I’d already been thinking about it but it was a great opportunity to put together those thoughts into something real. Since then I made many improvements, and while I’ve shelved the project for other endeavors I still want to write up what I’ve learned along the way.</description>

Every one of us has tried to have an argument with an employee of a big company, and it always goes like this:  the human being you are speaking to is only allowed to follow a set of processes and rules that pass on …</description>
