      <title>Soviet Venus Images</title>
      <link>http://mentallandscape.com/C_CatalogVenus.htm</link>
      <description>A digital video signal was transmitted from the lander to the orbiting main spacecraft and recorded on tape.  It consisted of 6 bits per pixel (plus a 7th parity bit) encoding a logarithmic brightness value.
Each scanline consists of 128 pixels, 11 of which are calibration and synchronization sent during the return stroke of the scanner.
This was relayed in real time and retransmitted a few times from the tape recording.
The complete video transmission seen below is reconstructed from digital data and photographic records.  After completing one panorama, the scanner reversed its motion, generating a second partial panorama, which appears upside down:</description>

      <title>Things I wish Git had: Commit groups</title>
      <link>http://blog.danieljanus.pl/2021/07/01/commit-groups/</link>
      <description>Everyone 1 and their dog 2 loves Git. I&amp;#160;know I&amp;#160;do. It works, it’s efficient, it has a&amp;#160;brilliant data model, and it sports every feature under the sun. In 13 years of using it, I’ve never found myself needing a&amp;#160;feature it didn’t have. Until recently.</description>

      <title>Stephen Bussey - What is a GenServer?</title>
      <link>https://stephenbussey.com/2021/07/02/what-is-a-genserver.html</link>
      <description>GenServer is one of the most common tools in the Elixir toolbag. I’ve written in the past about why you don’t need to know about GenServers to get started with Elixir. However, you will inevitably hit the point where you want (or need) them. This post will be my description of a GenServer to beginners to the language.</description>

      <description>The one-piece Cody was designed by Ton Vinken, as a way to construct a Cody kite out of a single piece of material. The one-piece Cody kite is in many senses similar to the traditional Cody. However, it differs in the upper planes of the front and back and the lower planes of the central boxes.</description>
