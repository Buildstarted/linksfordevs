      <title>Breaking the Sorting Barrier for Directed Single-Source Shortest Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17033</link>
      <description>We give a deterministic $O(m\log^{2/3}n)$-time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the $O(m+n\log n)$ time bound of Dijkstra's algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.</description>

      <title>Leadership Principles for Software Engineers: Interview With Adrian Stanek</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7liV4ERTo-0</link>
      <description>If you think leadership topics only apply to managers and above, think again! In this video interview, I was joined by Adrian Stanek. We got chatting about leadership principles, and they're all applicable to different roles and levels.

I really like how Adrian framed his four pillars. The concepts rang very true for me, and I think there's a lot of value here for software engineers.

Thanks for the chat, Adrian!

      <description>In one of the clients I‚Äôve worked on, they had several projects. In the process of extracting parts of the legacy project, they had a document with the gems that would be used according to the type of project, whether it was an API, if it had authentication, if it would call other APIs, or would have background processing. Every new project had a separate Dockerfile, GitHub actions configuration, Rubocop configuration, Brakeman, issue templates, etc.</description>

      <title>Getting Gemini to write an ORM for Spanner in a weekend</title>
      <link>https://suyogs.com/p/getting-gemini-to-write-an-orm-for-spanner-in-a-weekend/</link>
      <description>Recently, I wanted to get a Bun application working with Google Spanner. While Google provides a client library for Spanner (@google-cloud/spanner), the JavaScript (Node.js/Bun) ecosystem lacks a dedicated Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) specifically designed for Spanner‚Äôs native Google SQL dialect. This gap prompted an experiment: could Google‚Äôs Gemini assist in rapidly developing one? This post details that journey and introduces spanner-orm, a Google SQL ORM in Bun largely created with AI help over a weekend.</description>
