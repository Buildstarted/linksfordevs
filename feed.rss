      <description>Software people are always all up in the XY problem: someone asks about how to do X when what they’re really trying to solve is Y. I find the YX problem much more frustrating: where software people decide that they want to answer question Y even though what someone asks is question X.</description>

      <title>Conversational Spaced Repetition | David Bieber</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/</link>
      <description>I learn a lot from talking to large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude. Frequently I’ll ask the LLM to quiz me on what it’s taught me, in order to test my understanding of what I’ve learned. I find that doing so helps me learn the material better, promoting longer term recall. Even with this strategy in place, however, I still forget a lot of what I’ve learned from these AI assistants.</description>

      <title>Building For Builders - deven.codes</title>

      <description>Over the course of 2023-ish I wrote two Python frameworks (1) (1)I’d like to avoid a semantic debate, but for clarity’s sake when I say, “framework” I mean a library that holistically and generically targets the way you write applications (or tests in the case of sundew) rather than providing a narrow set of functionality. I think there is some unique consideration you have to have when targeting the whole way a developer builds software, but by I expect these learnings are things that would apply to development of any kind of library that you intend other people to use.</description>

      <title>Convenient sandboxed development environment – Blog – Joachim Breitner&amp;#39;s Homepage</title>
      <link>https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/812-Convenient_sandboxed_development_environment</link>
      <description>I like using one machine and setup for everything, from serious development work to hobby projects to managing my finances. This is very convenient, as often the lines between these are blurred. But it is also scary if I think of the large number of people who I have to trust to not want to extract all my personal data. Whenever I run a cabal install, or a fun VSCode extension gets updated, or anything like that, I am running code that could be malicious or buggy.</description>

      <title>More options for apps distributed in the European Union - Latest News - Apple Developer</title>
      <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8c1m8hqt</link>
      <description>We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.More flexibilityDevelopers who’ve agreed to the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have new options for their apps in the EU:
Alternative app marketplaces. Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.
Linking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional. 
Distributing directly from your websiteWeb Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit Getting ready for Web Distribution in&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;EU. </description>

      <title>Breaking Down Tasks - Jacob Kaplan-Moss</title>
      <link>https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/</link>
      <description>Something missing from this series on estimation, until now, has been a discussion of how to “break down” a project into a well-defined task list. I’d not previously written about this because, to me, it’s largely intuitive. But it isn’t for everyone, so this post fills the gap, and explains in detail how I break down projects into a task list.</description>

      <title>Cloning a laptop over NVME TCP</title>
      <link>https://copyninja.in/blog/clone_laptop_nvmet.html</link>
      <description>Recently, I got a new laptop and had to set it up so I could start using it. But I wasn&amp;#39;t really in the mood to go through the same old steps which I had explained in this post earlier. I was complaining about this to my colleague, and there came the suggestion of why not copy the entire disk to the new laptop. Though it sounded like an interesting idea to me, I had my doubts, so here is what I told him in return.</description>

      <title>Kdenlive 24.02.0 released - Kdenlive</title>
      <link>https://kdenlive.org/en/2024/03/kdenlive-24-02-0-released/</link>
      <description>The team is thrilled to introduce the much-anticipated release of Kdenlive 24.02, featuring a substantial upgrade to our frameworks with the adoption of Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6. This significant under-the-hood transformation establishes a robust foundation, shaping the trajectory of Kdenlive for the next decade. The benefits of this upgrade are particularly noteworthy for Linux users, as improved Wayland support enhances the overall experience. Additionally, users on Windows, MacOS, and Linux will experience a substantial performance boost since Kdenlive now runs natively on DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan respectively, replacing the previous abstraction layer reliance on OpenGL and Angle, resulting in a more efficient and responsive application. This upgrade brings significant changes to packaging, featuring the introduction of a dedicated package for Apple Silicon, the discontinuation of PPA support and an enhanced method for installing the Whisper and Vosk speech-to-text engines.</description>

      <description>Ok this post took a bit of inspiration from the C# Markup support that’s available for the Uno Platform where it’s easy to build a template selector (for a ListView for example) using a set of Case statements.

      <title>Webb &amp;amp; Hubble confirm Universe’s expansion rate</title>
      <link>https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Webb/Webb_Hubble_confirm_Universe_s_expansion_rate</link>
      <description>Webb measurements shed new light on a decade-long mystery.The rate at which the Universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant, is one of the fundamental parameters for understanding the evolution and ultimate fate of the cosmos. However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension, is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space Telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s measurements.</description>

      <title>C and C++ Prioritize Performance over Correctness</title>
      <link>https://research.swtch.com/ub</link>
      <description>The original ANSI C standard, C89, introduced the concept of “undefined behavior,”
which was used both to describe the effect of outright bugs like
accessing memory in a freed object
and also to capture the fact that existing implementations differed about
handling certain aspects of the language,
including use of uninitialized values,
signed integer overflow, and null pointer handling.</description>
