      <title>Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes</title>
      <link>https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-grpc-liveness-probe</link>
      <description>This page shows how to configure liveness, readiness and startup probes for containers.
The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.
A common pattern for liveness probes is to use the same low-cost HTTP endpoint as for readiness probes, but with a higher failureThreshold.</description>

      <title>E7: Thoughts on &amp;quot;Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.infrastructureposts.com/p/e7-thoughts-on-scaling-up-the-prime</link>
      <description>I came across this article the other day when it was all over reddit. I couldn’t help but notice that a lot of people seem to take this as “we should stop doing microservices all together and go back to building monoliths” and I want to elaborate on why I don’t think that was the point of the article at all and what we should take away instead.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Software Architecture With Architecture Tests</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/enforcing-software-architecture-with-architecture-tests</link>
      <description> Software architecture is a blueprint for how you should structure your system. You can follow this blueprint strictly, or you can give yourself varying levels of freedom.
But when deadlines are tight, and you start cutting corners, that beautiful software architecture you built crumbles like a house of cards.
How can you enforce your software architecture?
By writing architecture tests.
Architecture tests are automated tests that verify the structure and design of your code.
You can use them to enforce your software architecture and the direction of dependencies of your projects.
In this week&amp;#39;s issue I&amp;#39;ll explain how to: - Write architecture tests - Enforce architecture - Enforce design rules
Let&amp;#39;s dive in.</description>
