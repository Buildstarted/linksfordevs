      <title>&amp;quot;Well-made piece of crap&amp;quot; - Aman Y. Agarwal</title>
      <link>https://aman-agarwal.com/2024/09/17/well-made-piece-of-crap/</link>
      <description>The most valuable trait or habit that I’ve developed as an engineer is to “focus on the problem, not the solution.” Sounds very counter-intuitive. Don’t we usually say the opposite? The context here is that most people love to complain about problems and then hasten to slap solutions, as opposed to STUDYING problems and trying to investigate why they’re there in the first place — and solving the root cause. Most engineers are guilty of this. They love to rush to coding as soon as they see a requirement, as if they’ve been bit by a rabid dog and can’t...</description>

      <title>Why good things often don’t lead to better outcomes – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/why-good-things-often-dont-lead-to-good-outcomes/</link>
      <description>Many people believe that when something good happens, positive outcomes naturally follow — but I’m here to explain why that’s often not the case. In complex systems, improvements or advancements frequently set off a chain of reactions that can undermine the original benefits. This creates a paradox where progress in one domain often doesn’t lead to better results.</description>

      <title>Against Heroism • Dylan Fitzgerald</title>
      <link>https://dylanfitzgerald.net/blog/against-heroism/</link>
      <description>Does your organization regularly find itself celebrating its heroes—the folks that go above and beyond in light of a surprising Bad Thing happening, and can regularly be relied on to pick up other folks’ dropped balls?
Seems great, I suppose. Everyone loves a hero, right? How lucky you and your org are to have such people on staff!
The (relatively) superficial risk: losing one of these heroes hurts. If someone churns, burns out, or otherwise isn’t working with you anymore, that’s a tough hole to fill.</description>

      <description>Sarah sighed in frustration as she stared at her laptop screen, the SSH connection to the university server dropping for the third time in the last hour.
