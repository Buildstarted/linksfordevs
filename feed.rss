      <description>Ever been staying at a hotel and gotten annoyed that you always have to open a browser to log in for wireless access?  Yup, me too.  A recent instance was particularly frustrating and I had to pull out my favourite Swiss Army chainsaw in order to make my life a bit easier.</description>

      <title>Notes on debugging HotSpot’s JIT compilation</title>
      <link>https://jornvernee.github.io/hotspot/jit/2023/08/18/debugging-jit.html</link>
      <description>Typically when you compile a Java program, it is first compiled into bytecode by a Java compiler. However, this bytecode is not optimized yet. In HotSpot (OpenJDK’s JVM) this instead happens at runtime, and is done by a JIT, a Just-In-Time compiler. This way of doing things allows the JIT to take maximum advantage of the conditions that the code is running in, such as hardware, and even to a certain degree the specific data that is fed into the program.</description>

      <description>Almost all projects I&amp;#39;ve worked on have scripts we wrote to automate a repetitive process. Consecutively, the majority of the scripts became obsolete and unmaintainable after some weeks, because we either didn&amp;#39;t need them anymore or they have become too complex to be looked at. Afterwards, these scripts are either refactored or they stay forever in the scripts graveyard</description>

Introduction A common problem my friends and I have is receiving actionable emails whose priorities are medium level. They do require action of some sort ($ \geq lowest\ priority$), but the action is due in the near future ($\leq highest\ priority$). I tend to skim over these emails, get a gist of what is required of me, mark them as unread and promise to get back to them later.</description>

      <link>https://community.openai.com/t/chatgpt-4-is-worse-than-3-5/588078</link>
      <description>ChatGPT 4 is absolutely terrible for me, 90% of addons are giving out errors all the time and not working at all. Answers are extremely slow its not even translating all of my messages. The image feature is horrible, it doesnt recognize neither text or task on the image correctly. Conclusion: for 99% tasks gpt 3.5 is better and gpt 4 is raw, slow, buggy and useless.  20$ a month is TOO expensive for something that doesnt even work properly.</description>
