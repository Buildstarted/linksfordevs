      <title>Home - Strandbeest</title>
      <link>https://www.strandbeest.com/</link>
      <description>Theo Jansen is engaged in creating new forms of life: the so called strandbeests. Skeletons made from yellow plastic tube (Dutch electricity pipe) are able to walk and get their energy from the wind. They have evolved since their inception in 1990 and have been divided into 12 periods of evolution. Their properties determine this period. You will find the most important types of strandbeests at geneology.</description>

      <title>XAML Reuse with Templates in Applications for Windows and the Uno Platform - Nick&amp;#39;s .NET Travels</title>
      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/xaml-reuse-data-templates/</link>
      <description>XAML is often criticised for being verbose, hard to read and unnecessary as an additional language for defining the interface for an application. This feedback has lead to the creation of C# markup which works with both Windows UI / Windows App SDK and &amp;#160;Uno Platform applications. However, I find that the declarative nature and ...

      <title>You’re Probably Implementing Click and Drag Wrong</title>
      <link>https://sarahzrf.github.io/blog/clickndrag.html</link>
      <description>Any implementation of mouse-based interaction is basically a small
