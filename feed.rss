      <title>Lightweight alternatives to Google Analytics</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/822568/61d29096a4012e06/</link>
      <description>More and more web-site owners are concerned about the "all-seeing Google"
tracking users as they browse around the web. Google Analytics (GA) is a 
full-featured web-analytics system that is available for free and, despite the privacy
concerns, has become the de facto analytics tool for small and large web sites
alike. However, in recent years, a growing number of alternatives are helping
break Google's dominance. In this article we'll look at two of the lightweight
open-source options, namely GoatCounter and Plausible. In a subsequent article,
we'll look at a few of the larger tools.</description>

      <description>Hello guys.
I have been holding off to write this in case I was able to solve this problem on my own (which I tried to do very patiently), but the fact that I cannot talk to a human at Apple has prompted me to write this. Today I received another generic response from them (probably from a bot), so I’m prompted to write this to try to reach out to someone who can help.</description>
