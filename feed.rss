      <title>I Think I Know Why You Can’t Hire Engineers Right Now</title>
      <link>https://cushychicken.github.io/why-you-cant-hire-engineers/</link>
      <description>It’s always been hard to hire engineers, but it’s only gotten harder in recent months. Read any publication that cares about business, from the NYT to the Wall Street Journal, and you’ll see a ton of hand wringing about The Quittening, and the accompanying talent shortage. An equal amount of ink has been spilled about how red-hot the hiring market is. It’s a seller’s market for talent. This represents a huge potential opportunity for engineers of all stripes. Many engineers could pick up a five figure raise by switching companies right now. In spite of that, it doesn’t seem like many engineers are choosing to make the jump. Why is that?</description>

      <title>Another New Record in Self-Cleaning Turing Machines</title>
      <link>https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/01/10/another-self-cleaning-turing-machine.html</link>
      <description>How long can a Turing machine program run when started on the blank tape before the tape becomes blank again? Of course, this will depend on the length of the program – how many states and colors it has. Even given these parameters, it is logically impossible to calculate how long a self-cleaning Turing machine can run. Any values that can be known have to be discovered empirically.</description>

      <title>On keeping a personal journal and getting started</title>
      <link>https://mansour.blog/personal-journal/</link>
      <description>Keeping a journal does wonders for my learning, mental fitness and life reflections. Let me try to explain…
Think of a good conversation you had with a friend. Remember afterwards how you might have felt at ease? That your thoughts were more organised? A journal can be your friend that listens but doesn’t judge.
It is often said that to learn something best is to teach it, to explain it to someone.</description>

[1:13] About today’s episode with Aaron Stannard. [1:53] For application types, if someone is building a web application, a native application, or a mobile app, would they put Akka.NET in a backend process that consumes messages being received from somewhere? [3:53] Is high-scale more so Akka.NET’s bread-and-butter as opposed to low-scale, but constantly running? [10:10] Is the transport always a queue like Azure Service Bus or is it ever a web service call? [13:32] Is Akka.NET used instead of or with other frameworks?

      <description>Well, it is, sometimes. It depends. I often get pushback on MediatR for using service location for resolving handlers, often getting pointed at Mark Seemann&amp;#39;s post that Service Locator is an Anti-Pattern. And for all of the examples in the post, I agree that service location in those cases should</description>

      <description>As it stands, the answer to this question is going to remain largely subjective. If you have invested in Web3 (whatever it may turn out to be), you&amp;#39;re more than likely advocate that it is not. Whereas people who see no real-world application for Web3 are mostly going to say it is a scam.</description>

      <description>Reuben Harris and Monte Davidoff spent time disassembling Bill Gates’s original Altair BASIC. In an interview with The Register, Harris was impressed with the code, noting with some admiration, “I found a jump instruction that jumped to the middle of another instruction.”&amp;#185; You can find the targets of those jumps in the error handling code: Search for “Three common errors.”</description>
