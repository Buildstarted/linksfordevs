      <title>Collection Performance: Looping Over Reference Type vs. Value Type</title>
      <link>https://dotnettips.wordpress.com/2021/10/28/collection-performance-looping-over-reference-type-vs-value-type/</link>
      <description>Since most of the types and collections I create are typically business objects, I wondered if collections of simpler types would be faster. I decided to benchmark the difference between a List (re…</description>

      <title>Narwhal and Tusk: A DAG-based Mempool and Efficient BFT Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11827</link>
      <description>We propose separating the task of reliable transaction dissemination from
transaction ordering, to enable high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant
quorum-based consensus. We design and evaluate a mempool protocol, Narwhal,
specializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of causal
histories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and
maintains high performance despite failures. Narwhal is designed to easily
scale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that
there is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve. Composing
Narwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (Narwhal-HotStuff)
yields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults or
intermittent loss of liveness due to asynchrony. However, loss of liveness can
result in higher latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur
we design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to
work with Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of
configurations and faults. As a summary of results, on a WAN, Narwhal-Hotstuff
achieves over 130,000 tx/sec at less than 2-sec latency compared with 1,800
tx/sec at 1-sec latency for Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput
linearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 160,000
tx/sec with about 3 seconds latency. Under faults, both protocols maintain high
throughput, but Narwhal-HotStuff suffers from increased latency.</description>

      <title>Cracking Random Number Generators using Machine Learning – Part 1: xorshift128</title>
      <link>https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/15/cracking-random-number-generators-using-machine-learning-part-1-xorshift128/</link>
      <description>This blog post proposes an approach to crack Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) using machine learning. By cracking here, we mean that we can predict the sequence of the random numbers using previously generated numbers without the knowledge of the seed. We started by breaking a simple PRNG, namely XORShift, following the lead of the post published in [1]. We simplified the structure of the neural network model from the one proposed in that post. Also, we have achieved a higher accuracy. This blog aims to show how to train a machine learning model that can reach 100% accuracy in generating random numbers without knowing the seed. And we also deep dive into the trained model to show how it worked and extract useful information from it.</description>

      <link>https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/10/26/URI-based-Integration</link>
      <description>At the end of September, AWS
    announced a big new feature for its
    Step Functions product, and
    my tweet noting the announcement got a shocking number of
    impressions for something way out at the geeky end of Cloud tech.  In retrospect, a design choice we made back in 2016
    turns out to be working very well, and there’s a lesson to be learned here: If you need to integrate an arbitrarily
    large and and diverse set of software capabilities, URIs are the best integration glue.</description>
