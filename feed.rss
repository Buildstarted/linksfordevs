      <title>Microsoft Quietly Updates .NET Language Strategy </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/dotnet-strategy-updated/</link>
      <description>On February 6th 2023, Kathleen Dollard, principal program manager on .NET team at Microsoft, posted an update of the .NET language strategy. The new document is a continuation of the same ideas from the previous one, written in 2017, where C# and F# are the evolving languages and VB.NET is a niche language.</description>

      <title>Towards Modular Foundations for Protocol Security</title>
      <link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/187</link>
      <description>Universally composable (UC) security is the most widely used framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. Many variants and simplifications of the framework have been proposed and developed, nonetheless, many practitioners find UC proofs to be both difficult to construct and understand.

We remedy this situation by proposing a new framework for protocol security. We believe that our framework provides proofs that are both easier to write, but also more rigorous, and easier to understand. Our work is based on state-separable proofs allowing for modular proofs, by decomposing complicated protocols into simple components.</description>

      <description>Many things surprise people about how differently we work at Podia, but one that comes up often is that we have absolutely zero product/project managers at our company of more than 30 people. Despite this — though I’ll argue below that it’s precisely because of this — we’re shipping features faster than companies many times our size and resources.</description>

      <title>Granting at least once delivery</title>
      <link>https://tuwukee.github.io/ruby/fibers/2023/02/14/granting-at-least-once.html</link>
      <description>Exactly-once is the message delivery guarantee the most developers want to achieve in their systems. In the most cases, the implementation of the set of rules backing it up should include the application layer. When it comes to messaging systems, exactly-once delivery at an app level is much easier to be built on top of at-least-once, since at-most-once sometimes loses messages.</description>

      <link>https://blog.sebastiansastre.co/article/how-to-create-a-pharo-smalltalk-plugin</link>
      <description>When working with Smalltalk, you may wish to access functionality that exists in a specific library or technology that you do not want to recreate. In such cases, you have two options: creating an FFI bridge or extending the Smalltalk VM with new primitives. In this article, we&amp;#39;ll explore the less common method of extending the Pharo Virtual Machine with an external plugin by creating a HelloWorldPlugin. The goal is to provide insight and clarity into the process of extending the VM in this manner, and to explain the steps involved in Pharo 9 as of February 2023.</description>

      <description>In the field of Data Engineering, the Apache Spark framework is one of the most known and powerful ways to extract and process data.
It is well-trusted, and it is also very simple to use once you get the infrastructure set up.
Understandably, most engineers will choose it for every task.
However, in a lot of ways, it can be overkill. And a very expensive one.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to Nostr &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/nostr/</link>
      <description>“A milestone for open protocols…” This is how Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, announced the arrival of the Damus app, a Nostr protocol client, in the App Store/iOS.
Nostr has generated buzz in developer groups, bitcoin addicts, and a crowd very suspicious of their own shadows. The reason: Nostr brings an alternative to commercial social media that, in the words of its creators, would be “truly censorship-resistant”.</description>

      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/0e7512b0-c854-4cce-8606-765fcaf1e69c</link>
      <description>System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer has a weird quirk in regard to performance and memory management. So we will discuss what is &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; with this code: JsonSerializer.Serialize(myObject, new JsonSerializerOptions(...));.

      <title>.NET Managed languages strategy - .NET</title>
      <link>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/languages</link>
      <description>Each .NET language is unique. C# is the most widely used language and the language most of .NET is written in. F# explores new language possibilities and the community provides a rich experience across platforms. We remain committed to Visual Basic and continue to invest in maintaining C# interop and Visual Studio features for folks that love Visual Basic or want a stable language.</description>

      <title>Improving EF Core performance with Compiled Queries</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/improve-ef-core-performance-with-compiled-queries/</link>
      <description>This post is about improving EF Core performance with Compiled queries. From EF Core 2.0 onwards, EF Core supports compiled queries, which helps developers to compile the queries in advance and executed when application executes the query. By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate.</description>
