      <title>Optimistic Computing</title>
      <link>https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2024-12-09-optimistic-computing/</link>
      <description>I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I’m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn’t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav’s recommendation — and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.
I have been alive for approximately four decades. Each of those decades was witness to its own fun brand of computering.</description>

      <title>In search of a faster SQLite - blag</title>
      <link>https://avi.im/blag/2024/faster-sqlite/</link>
      <description>Researchers at the University of Helsinki and Cambridge attempted to build a faster SQLite using modern programming paradigms like io_uring and disaggregated storage. They demonstrate up to a 100x reduction in tail latency. These are my notes.</description>

      <title>Helix: Why (And How) I Use It | Jonathan&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jonathan-frere.com/posts/helix/</link>
      <description>I’ve come to accept that I’m just a sucker for shiny nerd things. I use Rust, despite never having had a professional reason to use it in my life. I switched to Linux in my student years and I’ve never looked back since, even though it constantly breaks and I can’t get my Bluetooth headphones to connect. I have a split keyboard with home row mods set up because I read some random blog posts and it looked cool to me.</description>

      <description>While researching for a talk, I came across a term that was new to me but summed up something I had seen and gave me language to describe it.
That team was the Transactive Memory System. This post talks about what it is, why it’s important and some tactics to help build it.</description>

      <title>Slow and Steady: My 15-Year Endurance Goal</title>
      <link>https://peak35.com/posts/endurancegoals/</link>
      <description>A few days ago, I was chatting with friends about goals in endurance sports. They mentioned wanting to join an event next year to have something to aim for. I totally get it — having a goal keeps you motivated. You picture yourself crossing the finish line, and just imagining it gives you a boost. And, of course, the closer the event is, the more urgency you feel to start training.</description>

      <title>Pi modder successfully adds M.2 slot to Pi 500</title>
      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/pi-modder-successfully-adds-m2-slot-pi-500</link>
      <description>As I briefly mentioned yesterday, someone mentioned in this blog&amp;#39;s comments a successful M.2 socket installation on the empty header on the Pi 500 (something I attempted, rather poorly!). With a few added components, and 3.3V supplied to a pad on the bottom via a bench power supply, the M.2 slot works just fine, allowing the use of NVMe SSDs or other PCIe devices.</description>

      <title>Should You Ditch Spark for DuckDb or Polars?</title>
      <link>https://milescole.dev/data-engineering/2024/12/12/Should-You-Ditch-Spark-DuckDB-Polars.html</link>
      <description>There’s been a lot of excitement lately about single-machine compute engines like DuckDB and Polars. With the recent release of pure Python Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric, the excitement about these lightweight native engines has risen to a new high. Out with Spark and in with the new and cool animal-themed engines— is it time to finally migrate your small and medium workloads off of Spark?</description>
