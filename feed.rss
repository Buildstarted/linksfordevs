      <description>Stress I’ve been meaning to jot down my thoughts on this for a while, but I keep running into things that tweak my mental model about stress.
Recently, I watched some old home videos. Twenty years ago, my parents moved us into the home we still live in today. Around this time, my dad filmed a video of my brother and I walking the quarter mile from our house to a canal that runs through metropolitan Phoenix.</description>

      <title>I built a perfect note taking system | The Sloth Blog</title>
      <link>https://thesloth.me/posts/6/</link>
      <description>Shopping lists, class notes, technical documentation, time and place of important appointment - all of these things are difficult to keep in our heads, therefore we tend to write things down. It doesn’t matter who you are and which field are you working in, you probably have some kind of note taking system in place. It could be a physical notebook, a pile of post-it notes, the default ’notes’ app in your phone or perhaps more sophisticated piece of software with advanced note management features.</description>

      <title>How to do templates properly</title>
      <link>https://me.svin.in/how-to-do-templates-properly/</link>
      <description>There are numerous templating engines out there. There is:
 Jinja2 - which is standard these days Python’s Django’s templates - which are much like jinja2, but not quite Go’s text/template which claims to be the template engine (hence, the name) Mustache, which is also popular And numerous others  I’ve even recently stumbled upon Calibre’s (which is an open-source e-book management tool) own custom (!!!) templating engine. The fact that I have to learn another templating engine so that my e-books can be placed into folders is insane.</description>

      <title>Noticing when an app is only hosted in us-east-1</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/us-east-1-latency</link>
      <description>Every time I leave New York and land back in Europe or in Asia, I can immediately tell which apps have a global presence and which apps only deploy to a single US region. Everything just immediately feels a little slower. The pull to refresh feels a bit sluggish, the preview images take a little longer to load, and even native apps just feel less responsive.</description>

      <description>After one of my presentations about F#, we had a discussion about the effect of type inference, resulting in almost no type annotations, on code readability and reviewability. The concern was that it makes the code harder to understand, especially when reviewing code, for example, outside of an IDE (GitHub/Azure DevOps/... Pull Requests). So is...</description>
