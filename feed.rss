      <title>Why Aren&amp;#39;t We Better at XP (or Almost Anything)? &amp;quot;Stop Making It Harder&amp;quot; - Johanna Rothman, Management Consultant</title>
      <link>https://www.jrothman.com/mpd/2021/11/why-arent-we-better-at-xp-or-almost-anything-stop-making-it-harder/</link>
      <description>There was a Twitter discussion about XP not having crossed the chasm. Someone Lula Rodrigues posted this wonderful Kent Beck talk about that here: https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/videos/xp-as-an-incentive-system-kent-beck-xp-2018/. Lots of great insights. Watch all of it, including the Q&amp;amp;A at the end. Early in the video, Kent discusses the all-too-frequent sexism and racism I also see in tech. … Why Aren’t We Better at XP (or Almost Anything)? “Stop Making It Harder” Read More &amp;#187;</description>

      <title>Polymorphic Serialization with .NET System.Text.Json</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/polymorphic-serialization-with-dotnet-system-text-json</link>
      <description>So you’ve decided you needed to use inheritance within your object model but are struggling to serialize all the data present on the instances of the types. In a previous post, I wrote about serializing an interface instances using a TypeConverter and you should definitely read that, as this post takes a part from that post. I’ve decided to pull the solution into its own post to make it easier to find for folks.</description>

      <title>Why I have settled on XChaCha20+Blake3 as the AE suite of choice for my projects</title>
      <link>https://mccarty.io/cryptography/2021/11/29/chacha20-blake3.html</link>
      <description>This might get me some looks, but I have pretty solidly decided to go in on using XChaCha20+Blake3 as the AE of choice for my future open source work. There are numerous reasons for this decision, but it mainly comes down to the desire for defense in depth, and a deep dislike of fundamental properties of polynomial MACs.</description>

      <title>Reducing an LTO Linux kernel bug with cvise</title>
      <link>https://nathanchance.dev/posts/cvise-lto-kernel-bug/</link>
      <description>My co-maintainer Nick Desaulniers wrote a great post about taking a several thousand line C file that exposed a compiler bug down to 12 lines with creduce. I thought I would do the same thing with a bug that only happens with link time optimization (LTO) in the Linux kernel, which is a bit of a different beast. Hopefully this post can help others reduce their own bugs and think about the best way to triage a bug.</description>

      <title>Culture of maintenance</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/tech-debt-reduction-culture/</link>
      <description>In most product-based companies, there’s an inherent bias on focusing on churning out features out the door as fast as possible. There’s this notion that the time to market for new features is everything. While this can be true for companies which are exploring their market fit, or attempting to expand their products in an attempt to increase their market share, there’s a huge “middle ground”, for companies who have a decent client portfolio and are stable enough that they can grow their products in a more methodical and controlled manner, where having this culture of simply pushing the technical boundaries of the product and churn out new features is not the only thing that matters.

      <description>You got invited to interview with Y Combinator – time to celebrate a little and pat yourself on the back! Or is it?

Getting to this stage is an accomplishment, but it isn’t time to declare victory. It’s time to buckle down, prepare, and ace the interview.

These are the top mistakes you’re probably making, and suggestions for how to fix them.

      <title>what I learned about interviewing</title>
      <link>https://lanie.dev/tech/interviewing/</link>
      <description>This was my first rodeo through the ride that is tech interviews. I had escaped the necessity that is formal technical interviews previous to this point. Oh buddy, did I end up with scabby knees. It was a steep hill to climb, especially when my previous job didn’t necessitate any of the skills they were interviewing on (pair programming with strangers, system design, etc.). It’s been said before, but interviewing is a skill in of itself; if you’re bad at technical interviews, it doesn’t have strong correlation to whether you’re a good programmer.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211130-00/?p=105985</link>
      <description>The ReceiveArray pattern is the Windows Runtime pattern for how a function can return a C-style conformant array to its caller. In C++/WinRT, the projected version of the function is // [out] parameter void M(com_array&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&amp;amp; value);  // return value com_array&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; M();</description>

      <title>Trimmed Harrell-Davis quantile estimator based on the highest density interval of the given width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11776</link>
      <description>Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics
are a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples.
These estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always
good enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile
estimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this
approach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions,
it&amp;#39;s not robust. To be able to customize the trade-off between statistical
efficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the
Harrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics
with low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta
distribution.</description>
