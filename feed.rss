      <title>Why I Removed Jinja2 from UiWizard</title>
      <link>https://ui-wizard.com/blog/Why-I-Removed-Jinja2-from-UiWizard</link>
      <description>Why remove the Jinja2 as a dependency?
For those unfamiliar, Jinja2 is a fast and powerful templating engine for Python — and it does its job exceptionally well.</description>

      <title>Experts have it easy</title>
      <link>https://boydkane.com/essays/experts</link>
      <description>Something that’s painfully understudied is how experts are more efficient than novices while achieving better results. I say understudied and not unstudied, because it’s common knowledge that charging people for their time results in experts being paid less since they work faster, which is why experts charge more for their time.</description>

      <title>Emacs for Everything</title>
      <link>https://joshblais.com/posts/emacs-for-everything/</link>
      <description>I used to laugh at the meme that emacs could be used for everything, and thought it crazy that one would "live in emacs" (that is a post from almost two years ago where I didn't even really believe it myself).</description>

      <title>Sometimes you just need to be asked</title>
      <link>https://danbartlett.co.uk/sometimes-you-just-need-to-be-asked/</link>
      <description>I’ve always appreciated the spontaneous answers that pop out when people ask me questions. It leads to responses that it’s hard to manufacture on your own.
But it was rare. You’d have to wait for an interview, some client work or a thoughtful friend to show up.
Until now. Open your AI of choice (I used 4o in this example) and share an idea you’re interested in. Tell it to ask you 4 questions.</description>

      <title>Dijkstra would’ve (incorrectly) HATED vibe-coding</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/dijkstra-vibe-coding/</link>
      <description>Edsger W. Dijkstra was one of the greats of computing, responsible for large parts of the way we write programs today. He was an early champion of structured programming. His missive “GOTO considered harmful” now seems blindingly obvious, but was against the grain of programming at the time (which is why he had to write it!).
In one of his missives he makes the case against using natural language for programming:</description>
