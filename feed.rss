      <title>14 Advanced Python Features</title>
      <link>https://blog.edward-li.com/tech/advanced-python-features/</link>
      <description>Python is one of the most widely adopted programming languages in the world. Yet, because of it‚Äôs ease and simplicity to just ‚Äúget something working‚Äù, it‚Äôs also one of the most underappreciated.
If you search for Top 10 Advanced Python Tricks on Google or any other search engine, you‚Äôll find tons of blogs or LinkedIn articles going over trivial (but still useful) things like generators or tuples.
However, as someone who‚Äôs written Python for the past 12 years, I‚Äôve come across a lot of really interesting, underrated, unique, or (as some might say) ‚Äúun-pythonic‚Äù tricks to really level up what Python can do.</description>

      <description>Pinterest‚Äôs OmniSearchSage represents a major step forward in unified semantic search. By extending the two-tower model into a multi-task, multi-entity framework, it enables a single query embedding to power retrieval across pins, products, and related queries. The system integrates GenAI captions, user-curated board metadata, and behavioral signals to overcome sparse content, while maintaining compatibility with legacy models like PinSage. Deployed at massive scale, OmniSearchSage delivers strong gains in search fulfillment, ad performance, and downstream tasks, showcasing a pragmatic and scalable approach to representation learning in production.</description>

      <description>The fuzzy search in Neovim is implemented by a couple of plugins.  Personally, I prefer Telescope, mainly it's easy to extend it, thank the rich documentation.  Also, Neovim supports Tree-sitter to get the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to build the symbol paths, the plugin Nvim Treesitter does the work.  Therefore, the high level plan is this:</description>

      <title>Nix: Better way for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://www.birkey.co/2025-04-15-nix:-better-way-for-fun-and-profit.html</link>
      <description>Every project depends on existing software that is beyond your
control. Nix DSL enables you to declaratively specify your projects
dependencies, a repo or a tar-ball down to the file digest of its
content, which is what gives nix superpowers of being a deterministic
and reproducible package manager. This means that if your inputs stays
the same, nix guarantees that it produces the exact same output
regardless of when and where. Below is a flake that pulls in latest
version of Clojure into your project.</description>
