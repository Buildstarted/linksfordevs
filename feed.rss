      <description>In the final installment of this three part series, we are going to use
our results from the previous two posts to construct a fully automated
variable leverage ETF. In part
one, we derived the
optimal leverage ratio for maximizing returns and in part
two we applied the ARMA
and GARCH models to forecast returns and volatility, respectively.</description>

      <title>Steven Gerhardt-King - Asking a stranger to watch your stuff at Starbucks doesn't make any sense</title>
      <link>https://stevengerhardtking.micro.blog/2020/05/07/asking-a-stranger.html</link>
      <description>“Hey can you watch my stuff for a second?”
– A person at Starbucks before they go to the bathroom
For game theory reasons, asking one stranger at Starbucks to watch your laptop while you run off to the bathroom is a bad idea. Here’s what doing so presumes:
 There are people at Starbucks looking for unattended property and hoping to snag it
OR
There are people who aren’t actively looking for unattended stuff but once they see it, they decide it’s too good an opportunity to pass up so they take it.</description>

      <description>Awaitables are the types on which await can be called. It happens due to “duck typing” – the only thing which makes type “awaitable” is an existence of the GetAwaiter() method that returns type implementing INotifyCompletion interface. That’s it.</description>

      <title>JUNETEENTH WORLD WIDE CELEBRATION</title>
      <link>http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm</link>
      <description>Juneteenth 

                is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of 

                slavery in the United States.  Dating back to 1865, it was on 

                June 19th that the Union soldiers, led by Major 

                General Gordon Granger, landed at Galveston, Texas with news 

                that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. Note 

                that this was two and a half years after President 

                Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation - which had become official 

                January 1, 1863. The Emancipation Proclamation had little impact 

                on the Texans due to the minimal number of Union troops to 

                enforce the new Executive Order. However, with the surrender of 

                General Lee in April of 1865, and the arrival of General 

                Granger’s regiment, the forces were finally strong enough to 

                influence and overcome the resistance.</description>
