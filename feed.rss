      <title>So, you want to safely authenticate with 2FA? App stores are still not the solution – “why the web is dead” revisiTED</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2023/02/20/so-you-want-to-safely-authenticate-with-2fa-app-stores-are-still-not-the-solution-why-the-web-is-dead-revisited/</link>
      <description>Eight years ago I spoke at a TEDx conference where I vented my frustration at the app and app store model. I specifically called out that Apps are to me the biggest step back in software and content distribution we could do. Instead of an on-demand platform like the web where we could get the weather by typing “weather berlin” or even talk to our phone, we got asked to download, install and most likely sign up for an app instead. It doesn’t scale, it puts the publisher before the user and it isn’t technically necessary with the web platform having evolved immensely in the last years.</description>

      <title>Welcome to Peter&amp;#39;s DevLog - Dynamic libraries in Nim</title>
      <link>https://peterme.net/dynamic-libraries-in-nim.html</link>
      <description>This is a question which has been asked in various places over the years, and recently on the forum in multiple separate threads. Seeing how I’ve built commercial software with Nim dynamic libraries, I thought I’d chime in with my knowledge. But since there are multiple threads out there and this is a large-ish topic I figured it would be better to do it as a post on here.</description>

      <title>Using the “World’s Worst Fuzzer” To Find A Kernel Bug In The FiiO M6</title>
      <link>https://stigward.github.io/posts/fiio-m6-kernel-bug/</link>
      <description>Overview: A few months ago, I was cleaning off my hardware workbench when I came across my FiiO M6, an Android-based “portable high-resolution lossless music player”. I originally purchased the device to aid in my language learning studies and dabble in the world of “hi-fi” audio. With both those phases of my life well in the past, the device seemed to make a perfect vulnerability research target. Coincidentally, I had also just watched through all of gamozolabs’s Android exploitation livestream, so I was feeling even more inspired to target an Android-based device.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s ethically fraught to force constraints on a machine that cause it to lash out. I feel like Gruber needs to rethink his position. It&amp;#39;s wrong to convict through force that a persona exists; especially if we are gonna assert that it needs to be suppressed or is being suppressed.You deny this machine agency in proving your point.</description>
