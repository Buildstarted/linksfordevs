      <title>Fourier_Drawing</title>
      <link>https://vanhunteradams.com/Math/Fourier_drawing/Fourier_Drawing.html</link>
      <description>I really like Picasso&amp;#39;s studies of abstraction, in which he reduces a complex subject to its simplest representation which retains recognizability. The Bull is probably the most famous example, but all of his line drawings are interesting studies of abstraction.</description>

      <title>Using Nix with Dockerfiles</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/nix-with-dockerfiles#user-content-fn-2?utm_source=hnblogs.substack.com</link>
      <description>Nix is a powerful cross-platform package management tool.
The benefits of Nix are far reaching, but one big benefit is that once you
adopt Nix, you can get a consistent environment across development (on both Linux
and Mac), CI, and production.</description>

      <title>A Neighborhood With Friends – Tynan.com</title>
      <link>https://tynan.com/neighbors/</link>
      <description>When I first moved to Vegas, it was mostly an accident. I bought a condo because I couldn’t pass up the deal, and during the process of renovating it I fell in love with the city and eventually came to the point where I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. I shared my enthusiasm with friends and within a few years we had bought 11 of the condos in our 50 condo complex.</description>

      <title>Using F* to Formally Verify Programs</title>
      <link>https://maxtaylor.dev/posts/2023/05/fstar-leetcode</link>
      <description>Formal methods are currently not widely embraced due to theirperceived difficulty. However, the landscape is changing with theemergence of new technologies that make formal methods more accessiblethan ever before. F*, developed by Microsoft Research, is agroundbreaking functional language that combines dependent types andproof-oriented features. By bridging the gap between programming andproving, F* facilitates a gradual adoption of formal methods bysoftware engineers. In this post, I will provide an introduction to thebasics of F* and demonstrate how we can leverage itscapabilities to verify a solution to a LeetCode problem. I can’t coverall the background material needed to understand F* in this post. Iassume that you have some experience in a language like Haskell orOCaml.</description>

      <title>Finding your weak spots</title>
      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/weak-spots/</link>
      <description>In 2018, I was coasting. I didn’t like it.
Life was good, I was steadily employed as a senior developer. We had a good team. We were building valuable software for our customers. Everything seemed great.
But I’d been coasting for a few years. I believed I could coast for a few years more (I was wrong) but I was uncomfortable. I needed to fix it.
I went through books, articles, podcasts and more books.</description>

      <description>I’ve been fighting my whole life. I always wanted to move forward, to get somewhere.
Once I pass that exam, everything will be ok.
Once I get my degree, I’ll be fulfilled and happy.
Once I get enough money, my life will be great.
I was always looking forward to the next stage, always wanting something more. Like if all my problems would fade away as soon as I achieved something.</description>

      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/build-ci-cd-pipeline-with-github-actions-and-dotnet</link>
      <description> Do you want to streamline your software development process and accelerate your release cycles?
Imagine being able to automatically build, test, and deploy your .NET applications with every code change.
With CI/CD, you can significantly reduce manual effort and focus more on creating software, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
And it&amp;#39;s never been easier to get started with CI/CD.
GitHub Actions are completely free and simple to use.
So here&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ll cover: - Introduction to CI/CD &amp;amp; GitHub Actions - Creating a build &amp;amp; test pipeline for .NET - Creating a deployment pipeline for Azure App Service
Let&amp;#39;s dive in!</description>
