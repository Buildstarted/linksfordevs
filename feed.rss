      <description>If you develop for the web, you&amp;#39;ve probably heard of OpenStreetMap, an open data alternative to Google Maps. Despite the wide name recognition of OSM, you may have questions like how do I make a web map with OSM data? and how can I host maps myself?</description>

      <title>Never Raising, Always Raising by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/maturation-venture-industry/</link>
      <description>Startups used to raise once every 18 months. Today, we joke in Startupland that a startup is never raising and always raising. The implication is the most sought after companies often receive offers, whether they are in market raising capital or not.
Take a moment to think through that statement with me. Venture capitalists and boards used to value a company every 18 months. Then, every 12 months. Now every 6 months or every 3 months some startups receive termsheets valuing their business.</description>

      <title>Compressing PDFs on Mac OS X with custom filters</title>
      <link>https://diurnal.st/2021/03/10/mac-reduce-pdf-size-custom-filter.html</link>
      <description>I learned recently that not only is it possible to add custom Quartz filters to Mac OS X, it’s very easy. Quartz is a 2D graphics library that sits behind the scenes on macOS. I’m not sure how much it’s used for these days, but at some point a nice developer made it possible to create simple Quartz filters via the ColorSync Utility app. The app has some pre-defined options for common needs and it can do far more than just adjust colors, despite its name.</description>

      <description>We created two very similiar promises for hot-start and cold-start coroutines. It turns out that we can unify them. The association between a promise and a task is not one-to-one, but rather one-to-many: A single promise can back multiple tasks. But how can you do that?</description>

      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/processors/cerebras-giant-ai-chip-now-has-a-trillions-more-transistors</link>
      <description>Almost from the moment Cerebras Systems announced a&amp;#160;computer based on the largest single computer chip ever built, the&amp;#160;Silicon Valley startup declared its intentions to build an&amp;#160;even heftier processor. Today, the company announced that its next-gen chip,&amp;#160;the Wafer Scale Engine 2 (WSE 2), will be available in the 3rd quarter of this year. WSE 2 is just as big physically as its predecessor, but it has enormously increased amounts of, well, everything. The goal is to&amp;#160;keep ahead of the ever-increasing size of neural networks used in machine learning.</description>
