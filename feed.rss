      <title>Evolving .NET Framework Monoliths with .NET 5 and Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbjh4T-cdv8</link>
      <description>You want to migrate your .NET monolith to microservices so you can run it in Kubernetes? That could be a year-long project, and you really don't need to do it. This session gives you a pragmatic approach to evolving your monolith, breaking features out into new microservices to get all the benefits of Kubernetes without a full rewrite. We'll start by running a legacy app in Windows containers and end with a distributed app running across Linux and Windows containers in the same Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <title>Why Johnny Won't Upgrade ¬∑ Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/why-johnny-wont-upgrade/</link>
      <description>Software distribution has over the years gone through an enormous revolution in efficiency. Originally, software was developed on things called ‚Äòplug boards‚Äô, a matrix of sockets that allowed quick (or so they thought) re-configuration of computing hardware to adapt it to different problems. This was soon followed by papertape, then the punched card deck, a stack of paper cards that contained the program code in a series of holes punched into the paper. Special readers and writers took care of reading, ordering and punching the cards. Woe to you if you dropped a deck of such cards or if your reader jammed or you spilled coffee all over a deck. (From personal experience: if you don‚Äôt immediately copy such a deck; within 10 minutes or so the cards will swell to the point that the reader will jam, this will not make your boss happy.) That principle plus miniaturization caused a quick succession of hardware based software distribution models culminating in ROM cartriges, a physical device that you buy which contains the program.</description>

After measuring your frontend performance, you're pleased to see that you got a very good pageindex score, but then you notice something else.Shortly after the page is presented, it doesen't seem to work? You have a hard time scrolling and buttons don‚Äôt seem to do anything? But if you wait just a bit, a handful seconds or more, suddenly everything works.Congratulations, you've entered the Uncanny Valley.</description>

      <title>Hiring is Broken | Emily Nakashima | Monktoberfest 2018</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=HaMPnpikCfk</link>
      <description>In spite of the best efforts and massive investments of some of the largest and best performing companies in the technology industry, the simple act of hiring remains fundamentally broken. Whether it's hostile and burdensome to candidates or inefficient and counterproductive for employers or both, hiring remains an area of pain for everyone involved. In this Monktoberfest talk, Emily Nakashima discussed how Honeycomb has gone back to the drawing board to completely rethink how they hire, and discussed what their early returns: what's worked, what needs to be improved and where they go from here. If you or your company is hiring technologists, this talk is for you.</description>

      <title>Optimal Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches | Ethan Rosenthal</title>
      <link>https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/2020/08/25/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana-sandwiches/</link>
      <description>I was personally useless for most of the Spring of 2020. There was a period of time, though, after the peak in coronavirus cases here in NYC and before the onslaught of police violence here in NYC that I managed to scrounge up the motivation to do something other than drink and maniacally refresh my Twitter feed. I set out to work on something completely meaningless. It was almost therapeutic to work on a project with no value of any kind (insert PhD joke here).</description>
