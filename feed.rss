      <link>https://ognjen.io/turns-out-elastic-arent-the-bad-guys/</link>
      <description>Elastic changed the licence for ElasticSearch disallowing providing it as a service. A lot of people were upset. My reflex was to join in the outrage but I wanted to better understand the motivation behind this decision. My reflex was to join in the outrage but I wanted to better understand the motivation behind this decision. I also wanted to consider the different arguments against it.

Following is a summary of the different arguments that helped me form a more nuanced understanding of the situation.</description>

      <title>The DevRel Lie</title>
      <link>https://ldoguin.name/en/2021/05/the-devrel-lie/</link>
      <description>As Devrel grows more popular so grows its identity crisis and questioning. And COVID-19 didn’t help. We wonder about its meaning. What is it? The good old Marketing or Engineering dilema. How do you measure what you do? This post is not a post about measuring DevRel. And it’s not about other ‘traditional’ topics like planes &amp;amp; airport, burnout and more recently how to become a live streamer. It’s not about Karaoke either sadly.</description>

      <description>I will start with the theory behind failure detection, and then review a couple of real-world examples of how the mechanism works in a real cloud - on Azure. Even though this article includes real-world applications of failure detection within Azure, the same notions could also apply to GCP, AWS, or any other distributed system.</description>

      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/deep-diving-ef-core-jeremy-likness/</link>
      <description>Entity Framework (EF) Core is a cross-platform, extensible, open-source object-database mapper for .NET. Since its first release in 2016, EF Core evolved until reaching its current form: a powerful and lightweight .NET ORM. InfoQ interviewed Jeremy Likness, program manager for .NET Data at Microsoft, to understand more about EF Core and what we should expect for its next release later this year.</description>

      <title>How to generate video thumbnail with Azure function</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-generate-video-thumbnail-with-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about implementing an azure function which generate a thumbnail image for a video stored in Azure Storage. In one of the project I am working there is a requirement to extract thumbnail for the video uploaded by user to a Azure Storage Account. This is implemented using .NET and C#. For extracting the video thumbnail - FFMediaToolkit package is used. And I am using ImageSharp package is for saving the image as well. I am using Azure Portal to create the function. You can use the same code if you’re using Visual Studio or VS Code, for the simplicity I am using CSX function. The function is using Windows OS. Platform is 64 Bit. Once you created the function app, create a new function with Blob Trigger.</description>
