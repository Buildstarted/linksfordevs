      <title>Turning popular links from your Mastodon timeline into an RSS feed</title>
      <link>https://tzovar.as/mastodon-rss/</link>
      <description>Ever since a certain someone bought Twitter, I’ve been quite invested into using the Fediverse as my main social web efforts. My Mastodon timeline does a good job for short-form text updates. And Pixelfed is a great nascent Instagram-replacement. One thing I particularly enjoy about both of them is the...</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve come to the conclusion that I don&amp;#39;t like GitHub. No, not the website or the company, but the idea itself. &amp;quot;Social 
coding&amp;quot;, the thing that has been its tagline. And no, not even the social part, but everything that we&amp;#39;ve come to accept as part of the &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; whenever
we encounter other social things, like social networks. The vanity stuff, in particular.</description>

      <description>I was just at a Tyler Cowen lecture in NYC — one of my heroes and biggest intellectual influences — and watching everyone file out after the talk, I kept thinking about this really great comment someone had made on the event announcement: “Do these 92Y talks typically offer space to build community and talk with other attendees, or are they pretty stale pay &amp;gt; attend &amp;gt; leave?”</description>

      <title>How to Build a Chess Engine and Fail</title>
      <link>https://obrhubr.org/chess-engine</link>
      <description>A Chess-AI is something every programmer should build at least once and [Sebastian Lague’s](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) [competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58) was the perfect opportunity for me to do so. Constrained to 1024 tokens I wanted to implement an evaluation function similar to that of Stockfish’s NNUE but heavily simplified. And instead of using a complex feed-forward algorithm to train the neural network I wanted to optimise the parameters using a genetic algorithm that relied on historical Stockfish data. However, I quickly realised why the model Stockfish uses has 50MBs of data and would not fit into my small bot for the competition…</description>

      <title>Oncall shift should be Tuesday to Tuesday</title>

      <description>Normally when developers/SWEs/SRE/IT are oncall for a project, the oncall is from Monday of one week to Monday of the following week. This is sub-optimal. Instead it should be Tuesday to Tuesday. This is a 0 cost improvement to everyone’s quality of life and improves schedule accuracy.</description>

      <title>LIVE CODING - WordPress Migration to Blazor - PART 5</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=uEd7Lhza3P4</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s time! WordPress on AWS LightSail has been non-stop problems for nearly 2 years now.

Time for a change.

I&amp;#39;ll be looking into using LinkDotNet.Blog by Steven Giesel as my blog engine of choice. But migrations are never easy, so this will be the first of many sessions trying to figure out how I can get my blog setup before going live.

Remember -- I need to keep as many links active as possible so I don&amp;#39;t ruin my SEO!

Hey everyone! Today we&amp;#39;re diving into something that&amp;#39;s going to make your life WAY easier if you&amp;#39;re building distributed applications in .NET. We&amp;#39;re looking at the new service discovery capabilities that came out of the .NET Aspire project.

If you&amp;#39;ve ever dealt with hardcoded service URLs or struggled with service discovery in your microservices, this video is for you. I&amp;#39;ll show you how to implement service discovery in your .NET applications using a simple NuGet package that makes everything just... work.

We&amp;#39;ll cover:
- Setting up service discovery in your .NET app
- Configuring the reverse proxy
- Making services discoverable
- Best practices and common pitfalls

No complicated configurations, no complex setup - just straightforward, practical service discovery that you can implement today. Whether you&amp;#39;re new to microservices or a seasoned developer, you&amp;#39;ll find something valuable here.

      <title>What Is .NET Aspire and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=0Cyb4OFhQbI</link>
      <description>Heard about .NET Aspire but have no clue what it is, and what it can do for you? Let me show you exactly what you have been missing out on!

Don’t let all the buzzwords scare you. It’s a lot easier than it may sound. Throughout this video we will explore the different parts of what makes .NET Aspire. How do you make it easier for a web frontend to discover an API? How do you easily add a Redis cache to an application, or any arbitrary docker container for that matter?

No matter if you can figure out how to get a complex solution running locally, making this process easier will save both time and money. 

.NET Aspire is really just a tool to make development easier. By providing a set of opinionated decisions, to introduce open telemetry, service discovery, http client configurations, and much more. All of this to make it a lot easier to run complex, and easy, solutions. Locally, or in the cloud! 

At the end of this video, we will take it one step further from local development to get the entire stack published to the cloud, without a lot of work at all!

Without further ado, let’s learn about .NET Aspire!
