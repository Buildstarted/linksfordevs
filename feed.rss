      <description>Writing your own TCP/IP stack may seem like a daunting task. Indeed, TCP has accumulated many specifications over its lifetime of more than thirty years. The core specification, however, is seemingly compact[^tcp-roadmap] - the important parts being TCP header parsing, the state machine, congestion control and retransmission timeout computation.</description>

      <description>These are early days in the march towards a truly user-owned internet, and it is quite normal that the critical building blocks of such an effort (in this case, NFTs) get misunderstood and criticized quite a bit. Here is one perspective to help NFT critics see the light.</description>

When debating, we usually consider that opinions are merely resulting of being exposed to logical arguments. And understanding them. If arguments are logical and understood, people will change their mind.

      <title>Owning Your Matrix Account</title>
      <link>https://blog.ergaster.org/post/20210622-owning-your-matrix-account/</link>
      <description>When we deployed our Matrix instance for GNOME, we were really used to IRC. We did not think through all the ways people would use an account for, and left registrations too open. As a consequence, many people created an account on our instance because they like the GNOME Project, and started using it as a personal account.
Now that we are more experienced with the difference between an organisational account and a personal one, I would like to walk you through the differences between the two, why segregating activities can be useful, and finally how to migrate data from an account to another.</description>
