      <title>Use Redis With HybridCache to Cache Your EF Core Data!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=A4iEVoYpgnk</link>
      <description>In earlier videos in the series, we saw how we could convert our Entity Framework Core data access from IMemoryCache to HybridCache!

But... there was one big problem:

It was still just a memory cache behind the scenes!

Let's see how we can get Redis wired up to our HybridCache!

      <title>Who goes through Y Combinator twice?</title>
      <link>https://www.jordanroga.com/blog/who-goes-through-y-combinator-twice</link>
      <description>Y Combinator has long been considered the gold standard of early-stage startup accelerators. But while most founders view it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, a rare group sees it differently‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas a repeatable launchpad. These are the founders who‚Äôve gone through YC not once, but twice (and occasionally, more). In this post, we‚Äôll dive into the patterns and profiles of these YC returnees: What kinds of people get accepted multiple times?</description>

      <title>No, Software Moats Are Not Dead</title>
      <link>https://bloeys.com/blog/no-software-moats-are-not-dead/</link>
      <description>Note: This is not a random rant against AI, after all I am a Founder of an AI startup, Overlord Systems.
Much has been written recently about how software no longer has a moat because AI gives you both engineering ability and a high speed of producing software, therefore making any piece of software copyable in a short time, and thus software is no longer a moat. Only, this is isn‚Äôt true in the way it‚Äôs being advertised.</description>

      <title>DIY Streaming Video 101</title>
      <link>https://scottstuff.net/posts/2025/03/18/video-encoding-101/</link>
      <description>So, you want to stream video on the web without dealing with Youtube or other video providers? Where do you even start?
Welcome to DIY Streaming Video 101.
I‚Äôm slowly working on building the infrastructure here for encoding and serving videos myself, and I‚Äôm trying to share what I‚Äôve learned. I‚Äôm doing everything on Linux, mostly using FFMPEG for video conversion and serving the video myself, from a web server in my house.
Obviously, there are many services that you can pay to do this all for you, and most of them will do a better job at it most of the time, for a fee. But they may not be that much better, depending on your needs, and video streaming really isn‚Äôt that hard anymore.
All you need is a bit of time and a website.</description>

      <title>Toying Around</title>
      <link>https://toyi.ng/blog/llm-geocoding</link>
      <description>I was playing around with Google's Geocoding API when I thought to plug in my address into o1 for
        fun and
        curiosity's sake. Imagine my surprise when it actually got the coordinates right down to the first 3 decimal
        places
        (precision of within hundreds of meters)! Considering the fact that it got in the near vicinity without any
        internet access at all, that's pretty impressive. Naturally, the next step was to host a battle royale with a
        bunch of other widely-used LLMs to see which one is best for this "offline" geocoding (yes, I'm considering
        closed-weights LLMs in this, just imagine you're in the book Project Hail Mary, and you have access
        to
        every computer program ever).</description>
