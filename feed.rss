      <title>Original Prusa i3 MMU2S upgrade kit (for MK2.5S &amp;amp; MK3S/+) - ORG | Original Prusa 3D printers directly from Josef Prusa</title>
      <link>https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mmu2s-upgrade-kit-for-mk2-5s-mk3s-org/</link>
      <description>Multi Material Upgrade 2S (MMU2S) is a brand new and improved version of the Multi Material Upgrade 2.0 - our unique multi-material addon, which enables your 3D printer to print with up to 5 colors at the same time. With an easier calibration process, a new filament sensor, and a standalone filament buffer, the MMU2S is more reliable than ever before.
This product is supplied as a kit - you must assemble it by yourself! 
Please note, the assembly manual for the MMU2S upgrade kit is available in digital form only.
Note for MK3 users, you also need to purchase the MK3/S to MK3S+ upgrade kit with the MMU2S.</description>

      <title>How to build a BVH – part 5: TLAS &amp;amp; BLAS – Jacco’s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/05/07/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-5-tlas-blas/</link>
      <description>In this series we explore the wonderful world of the bounding volume hierarchy: the mysterious data structure that enables real-time ray tracing on recent GPUs, in complex, animated scenes. Despite the broad adoption of ray tracing in games, in-depth understanding of the underlying technology seems to be reserved to a select few. In this article we show how a proper BVH is implemented without support from DXR / RTX / OptiX / Vulkan, in easy-to-read ‘sane C++’. Whether this is actually useful for you, or just interesting as background information, depends on your needs, obviously.</description>

      <title>It&amp;#39;s probably not just chess and language, so how much potential is getting thrown away?</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/missed_potential_chess_language/</link>
      <description>I’ve been heavily into chess recently, and I’m trying to improve in every way I know how; reading books, following courses, memorizing openings, analyzing games, doing puzzles. I’m an “adult improver”, as we’re known in the chess world. I may get very good, but I will never be a grandmaster, or even an international master. The only chance I had to be a grandmaster died at around the age of 10, and maybe my chances of being an IM died a few years after that.</description>

      <title>Make Lists, Build Habits, Get Un-Stuck</title>
      <link>https://hochadel.blog/posts/lists-and-habits/</link>
      <description>Today I nearly got stuck while learning something new. In the early years of my programming career, I got stuck all the time. Now, I rarely do. I thought I’d write about how I got from there to here, using today’s experience as a representative example of what often happens when I’m learning something new.</description>

      <title>Unix command line conventions over time</title>
      <link>https://blog.liw.fi/posts/2022/05/07/unix-cli/</link>
      <description>This blog post documents my understanding of how the conventions for Unix command line syntax have evolved over time. It’s not properly sourced, and may well be quite wrong. I’ve not been using Unix until 1989, so I wasn’t there for the early years. Maybe someone has written a proper essay on this, with citations. I’m too lazy to dig them up.</description>

      <title>Why a Meeting Costs More than a MacBook Pro – the Business Case for Fewer Developers in Meetings</title>

      <description>The meeting&amp;#39;s opportunity cost is higher than the price of a brand-new M1 MacBook Pro. If the meeting was pointless, might as well cancel it and fly one of the devs to Bali instead.</description>
