      <title>How To Setup Redis With Dependency Injection in C# in 10 Minutes!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=2fe49mg1RnQ</link>
      <description>A viewer requested a tutorial on using Redis with dependency injection without all of the ASP NET Core caching layers. They just wanted to work with it directly.

In this video tutorial, I'll show you how you can easily get setup to use Redis in your C# applications!

      <title>Building Multi-Tenant APIs Using EF Core and Row-Level Security</title>

Think your authorization checks are secure? Think again.

In this video, I show how one missing filter in your API can leak sensitive user data ‚Äî and how to prevent that with PostgreSQL's built-in Row-Level Security (RLS).

‚úÖ We‚Äôll build a real .NET Core API using EF Core and Postgres  
‚úÖ Show how to extract user IDs from JWT tokens  
‚úÖ Use an EF Core interceptor to safely set session variables  
‚úÖ Enable and configure RLS in Postgres for bulletproof data isolation

Protect your multi-tenant systems. Stop depending on app-layer filters alone.

üí° Perfect for .NET devs building secure, multi-tenant apps.

      <title>Document Search in .NET with Kernel Memory</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=h8bKn1nzjrQ</link>
      <description>Ever wanted to search or perform question answering on documents, PDFs, or web pages but weren't sure about costs or security? Kernel Memory is a .NET library that allows you to use whatever embedding and text models you'd like (including Ollama and OpenAI models) and whatever vector store you'd like to index and search documents in a flexible way using a minimal amount of C# code.</description>

      <title>That fractal that's been up on my wall for 12 years</title>
      <link>https://chriskw.xyz/2025/05/21/Fractal/</link>
      <description>Warning: Math, Handwaving

I spent a lot of time doodling in middle school in lieu of whatever it is middle schoolers are
supposed to be doing. Somewhere between the Cool S‚Äôs
and Penrose triangles I stumbled upon a neat
way to fill up graph paper by repeatedly combining and copying squares. I suspected there was
more to the doodle but wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that
knows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high
school to college to the present day.

      <title>AI Can‚Äôt Even Fix a Simple Bug ‚Äî But Sure, Let‚Äôs Fire All Our Engineers</title>
      <link>https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-scam</link>
      <description>Reddit discovered the funniest thing in tech this week, and it shows exactly how broken the AI narrative is. The newly released GitHub Copilot agent was given permission to make pull requests on Microsoft‚Äôs .NET runtime, and the results couldn‚Äôt be funnier. The AI confidently submitted broken code, while human developers patiently explained why it didn‚Äôt work. Over and over again, for days. I feel bad for the engineers in this PR, but I also can't stop laughing. What‚Äôs worse is that CEOs are using this same technology to justify laying off entire engineering teams.</description>

      <link>https://berti92.github.io/posts/3_years_into_foldables.html</link>
      <description>Foldables... Since Samsung announced their very first Galaxy Z Fold, I was really pumped. I liked the idea so much, to
        have your phone AND tablet always in your pocket. Sure, the first version was laughable as fuck, but I immediately get
        the idea and was eager to see the ongoing generations. Every generation was a bit better, and the phones got more
        durable.</description>

      <title>In 2025, Apple still makes it hard to play your own MP3s, so I wrote my own app</title>
      <link>https://nexo.sh/posts/why-i-built-a-native-mp3-player-in-swiftui/</link>
      <description>In 2025, playing your own music on an iPhone is surprisingly hard, unless you pay Apple or navigate a maze of limitations. So I built my own player from scratch, with full text search, iCloud support, and a local-first experience. GitHub link
Why I Built My Own Audio Player Like many people, I‚Äôve picked up too many subscriptions, some through Apple (iCloud, Apple Music), others got lost in random platforms (like Netflix, which I forgot I was still paying for). I actually used Apple Music regularly (and previously Spotify), but the streaming turned out to be more convenience than necessity. With a curated local library, I didn‚Äôt lose much, just the lock-in.</description>

      <title>Refactoring My Infrastructure As Code Configurations</title>
      <link>https://not-a-number.io/2025/refactoring-my-infrastructure-as-code-configurations/</link>
      <description>The drupol/nixos-x260 repository began as a simple and practical way to manage the configuration of my Lenovo ThinkPad X260 laptop, hence the (bad) name. Unsurprisingly, I quickly became hooked on the NixOS Linux distribution, and before long, I was running it on every machine I owned‚Ä¶ first at home, then even at work (shhht!). As the obsession grew, so did the project. It naturally expanded to support a wide variety of systems: from a simple Intel-based laptop, to a Raspberry Pi router tucked away in the basement, and even an old iMac from 2012. Each machine came with its own quirks and specific requirements. Like many personal setups, what started as a clean and elegant solution gradually evolved into a tangled web of host-specific hacks and duplicated logic.</description>

      <title>Vibe coding is metaprogramming - foobuzz</title>
      <link>https://blog.valentin.sh/vibe-metacoding</link>
      <description>I originally wanted to write 2 distinct articles, but realized that they shared the same underlying idea: "Vibe coding", the act of talking to an LLM / LLM-based AI agent to code a full project without writing a line of code manually, is no more than a metaprogramming technique, where a program (the AI agent), produces another program (the code that gets committed). As such, it shares some common characteristics of metaprogramming, notably: 1) The use-case of using metaprogramming when lacking an abstraction. 2) The poor experience of maintaining metaprogramming output when you can't maintain the generator level.</description>
