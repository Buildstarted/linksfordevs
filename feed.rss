      <title>Vendor Unlocking My Life</title>
      <link>https://blakeashleyjr.com/posts/vendor-unlocking-my-life/</link>
      <description>In an era where digital dependence is commonplace, I moved towards personal tech independence in 2023. This blog post details my transition away from mainstream tech giants and towards more secure, private, and autonomous alternatives.
Breaking Free from the Norm In 2023, I finally broke free from the likes of Google, Facebook, and other tech giants—a commitment I&amp;amp;rsquo;d long made to myself but never fulfilled. Like many of you, Google and Facebook had been my internet cornerstones for years, offering convenience, cost-effectiveness, and entertainment.</description>

      <description>Rule of thumb: the size of build or CI configuration should be mostly independent of the project size.
In other words, adding, say, a new test should not require adding a new line to the build file to build the test, and a new line to .yml to run it on CI.</description>

      <title>Efforts and Goals and Joy</title>
      <link>https://map.simonsarris.com/p/efforts-and-goals-and-joy</link>
      <description>There was joy in concentration, and the world afforded an inexhaustible wealth of projects to concentrate on. There was joy in effort, and the world resisted effort to just the right degree, and yielded to it at last. People cut Mount Rushmore into faces; they chipped here and there for years. People slowed the spread of yellow fever; they sprayed the Isthmus of Panama puddle by puddle. Effort alone I loved. Some days I would have been happy to push a pole around a threshing floor like an ox, for the pleasure of moving the heavy stone and watching my knees rise in turn.</description>

Note that it describes itself as a metasearch engine specifically - unlike your traditional search engine like Google or Bing, SearXNG does things a little bit differently: It aggregrates the results produced by search services like those aforementioned, and feeds them back to you.</description>

      <title>Choosing a vector index – Chirag Agrawal</title>
      <link>https://chiragagrawal.me/2023/03/25/choosing-a-vector-index/</link>
      <description>Choosing a vector index for a real world problem is not obvious, there is usually a trade-off amongst memory, speed and accuracy. Different vector indexing techniques are optimized for different concerns. In this post I will attempt to provide a high level overview of various popular indexes for vector search. It doesn’t dive deep into the specifics of indexing algorithms, but it will help you understand advantages and drawbacks of each technique and how a particular index can be fine-tuned for speed-accuracy trade-off.</description>

      <title>How I forked SteamOS for my living room PC — iliana.fyi</title>
      <link>https://iliana.fyi/blog/build-your-own-steamos-updates/</link>
      <description>SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into that partition. But consumers can also run steamos-devmode to unlock the root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them a working Linux distro with a normal package manager.</description>
