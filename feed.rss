      <title>Stop Conflating CQRS and MediatR</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/stop-conflating-cqrs-and-mediatr</link>
      <description>The .NET ecosystem has gradually fused CQRS and MediatR together, creating a reflexive assumption that they&amp;#39;re inseparable, but this mental shortcut has led teams down a path of unnecessary complexity. This article dispels common misconceptions by explaining how CQRS and MediatR are distinct tools solving different problems, and demonstrates how to implement CQRS effectively with or without MediatR.</description>

      <link>https://smoores.dev/post/we_rewrote_nyt_text_editing/</link>
      <description>For the past six years, I’ve been trying to integrate React and ProseMirror, the popular rich text editing library. I’ve finally published @handlewithcare/react-prosemirror, which includes complete rewrite of ProseMirror’s rendering engine in React. Here’s a very deep dive into the journey I took, and why it led me where it did!</description>

      <title>How to do well in a technical interview | Radu Ghitescu</title>
      <link>https://ghitescu.com/articles/how-to-do-well-in-a-technical-interview/</link>
      <description>Over the past 7 years I&amp;#39;ve sat across virtual and physical tables from many software engineers, from bright-eyed juniors to battle-tested veterans with decades of experience under their belts. Today, I want to speak directly to you, the job seeker, and suggest how you can increase your chances of securing a technical role. Of course, this assessment is through my own lens and my advice may not help you in any situation, but as usual you should use your best judgement.</description>

      <title>Stanford Lecture - Strong Components and Weak Components, Dr. Donald Knuth I 2024</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hi8r_63LGyg</link>
      <description>The 28th annual Christmas lecture
Thursday, December 5, 2024

A directed graph can often be best understood and used if we partition its vertices into separate components of various kinds. Most important are the strongly connected components, called “strong components” for short; and strong components are in turn partitioned into “weak components.”

Two definitions of weak components have appeared in the literature of graph theory. One of them is rather weak and uninteresting, while the other is becoming more and more relevant and appreciated (see weak components revived). Basically, the strong components are the smallest clusters of vertices that you can shrink to a point and obtain a dag, a digraph with no oriented cycles. The weak components, correctly defined, are the smallest clusters that you can shrink to a point and obtain an oriented path.

Dr. Knuth will discuss Robert Tarjan&amp;#39;s beautiful algorithms for computing the strong and weak components of a given directed graph. (This will be fun because Dr. Knuth&amp;#39;s personal favorite, among all of the algorithms of all kinds that he has encountered so far in his life, is Tarjan&amp;#39;s method for discovering the strong components as it explores the graph.)

Furthermore, if time permits, Dr. Knuth disclose the answer to the following riddle: In what major world city are shirts of size XL smaller than shirts of size L?
