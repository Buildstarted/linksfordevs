      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/16677006/dotnetrocks-1825-energy-geek-out-2022</link>
      <description>End of the year, time for a geek out on energy! Richard chats with Carl about the usual modern power generation sources, including solar and wind, and a breakthrough in the drilling method for geothermal energy. The conversation dives into small modular reactors (SMR) and the commitment in Canada to build the first SMR! Molten Salt Reactors have made some progress in 2022, but the extensive conversation is about fusion power. From the NIF announcement to Commonwealth Fusion and others - there&amp;#39;s lots to talk</description>

      <description>It’s easy to notice when a car collides with another. The impact and crunching of flimsy metal and hard plastic grabs you, reminds you to concentrate, and in remembering, you might grip the wheel, reassert your focus, and shake your head in judgment at the lack of attention that some people pay.

      <title>Atomic habits implemented</title>
      <link>https://jorzel.github.io/atomic-habits-implemented/</link>
      <description>In the previous post about continuous improvement, I focused on the need for a system that can make our goals achievable. However, it is easier said than done. Now, I would like to move my attention from “what” to “how” and present a learning system implementation based on habits. The majority of this article is a recapitulation of ideas from James Clear’s excellent book Atomic Habits. Besides, I share some implementation advice relevant to the Software Development learning route.

      <title>Some Advice for Browsing Wiktionary in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://nickdrozd.github.io/2022/12/19/wiktionary-advice.html</link>
      <description>Emacs comes with a web browser built in. Although it’s often regarded as a novelty, EWW (as it’s known) is a real browser, and I use it all the time. A lot of web browsing involves text, and Emacs is the ultimate text-handling platform, so it’s obvioiusly a good match.</description>

      <title>Lessons not worth learning.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/lessons-not-worth-learning/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago I had a call with a startup founder who was frustrated with their team. The team kept getting distracted by interesting work, and was avoiding the most important work to move the business forward. Was it possible to build a team that simply does the important work without getting distracted by more interesting or energizing work? Why can’t you build a team that operates rationally to the businesses interests rather than their own?</description>
