      <title>iLeakage: Browser-based Timerless Speculative Execution Attacks on Apple Devices</title>
      <link>https://ileakage.com/</link>
      <description>We present iLeakage, a transient execution side channel targeting the Safari web browser present on Macs, iPads and
						iPhones. iLeakage shows that the Spectre attack is still
						relevant and exploitable, even after nearly 6 years of effort to mitigate it since its discovery.
						We show how an attacker can induce Safari to render an arbitrary webpage, subsequently
						recovering sensitive information present within it using speculative execution. In particular,
						we demonstrate how Safari allows a malicious webpage to recover secrets from popular high-value
						targets, such as Gmail inbox content. Finally, we demonstrate the recovery of passwords, in case
						these are autofilled by credential managers.</description>

      <title>Avoiding addictions</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/avoiding-addictions/</link>
      <description>Capitalism is great at giving people what they demand and making them even want things they don’t need. Once a company creates a product or service, the industry streamlines its production, distribution, and sales to maximize efficiency. The more they sell, the better it is for the business.
Living in a market-driven society is a blessing if you want to buy a good fork or a reliable car. However, there’s a flip side to this coin: an entire sector focuses on enticing consumers with addictive products and services, and that’s where the danger begins.</description>

      <title>It&amp;#39;s Fucking Impossible to Stay Healthy</title>
      <link>https://www.withentropy.com/blog/2023-10-24-its_impossible_to_stay_healthy/</link>
      <description>My college physical life was a bit strange. I worked out(weights) nearly every day, except that I basically didn’t move from my chair at any other point in time. Food was a block away, and I nearly never went to class. The few times I did, I would use an electric scooter. It wasn’t like I was a health nut, but I generally kept my weight between 175-180lb as a 6&amp;#39;0 male.</description>

[18:37] What are the newer concepts and newer advances that are worth taking a look at? [19:10] Maturing minimal APIs. [24:53] Endpoint filtering. [27:01] Does the core logic need to be aware that it might be in a caching workflow, or does caching as a concept belong to the interface for the application programming? [31:45] Shawn’s favorite method for testing the complete set of web service APIs. [34:59] Helping young developers not get lost along the way of feeling the need to be perfect. [39:25] How developers make the decision of where and how to run the applications they built. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode: YARP     — New Video Podcast! Email us at .

      <title>Tarsnap has given 2^18 dollars to open source</title>
      <link>https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2023-10-25-2%5E18-dollars-to-open-source.html</link>
      <description>Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled
&amp;quot;We
Just Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers&amp;quot;, and it made me wonder
just how much Tarsnap had spent
on supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since
December 2009
Tarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting
open source software — which, since needs for support aren&amp;#39;t limited
to December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and
at the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in
December) I send whatever is left in the &amp;quot;budget&amp;quot; to the
FreeBSD Foundation.
Going through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total
of $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD.</description>
