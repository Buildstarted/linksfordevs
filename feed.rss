      <title>Home Office Killed My Laptop Battery :: Thore Goebel</title>
      <link>https://thore.io/posts/2022/12/home-office-killed-my-laptop-battery/</link>
      <description>This post is a collection of things I learned about batteries. This is my adventure diving into why doing too much home office killed my laptop battery, and my journey replacing it. It is not necessarily data-driven, but at least data-intuited.
Motivation Before the pandemic, my laptop (a ThinkPad) was on and off the charger. I was walking around university, sitting in lectures, going to the library. I would charge my laptop when the battery was getting low, and then disconnect the charger again.</description>

      <title>Designing a successful digital product</title>
      <link>https://www.alexscamp.com/designing-a-successful-digital-product/</link>
      <description>Design principles back all great digital products. You can think of them as core values everyone understands and promotes. They guide the design process, teams, and end-product vision. These principles are more or less universal and are used to build world-class products at companies like Spotify, Airbnb, and Figma.

      <title>Understanding the UBI File System in Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://serhack.me/articles/understanding-ubi-file-system-embedded-devices-reolink/</link>
      <description>In Part 3 of our series, we explored the hardware device elements of the Reolink RLC-810A ― focusing on the NAND memory. We continue with Part 4 of our exploration into an IP camera firmware through introducing the concept of a file system. Furthermore, we will explore the technical reasons for choosing the UBI File System (UBIFS), a file system used especially for a category of mass storage, and we will unpack the UBIFS part using the ubi-extract tool.</description>

      <title>Writing French in Vim - Monolune</title>
      <link>https://www.monolune.com/articles/writing-french-in-vim/</link>
      <description>When using Vim, I mostly write text in English, but the need to write in French made me curious about the things that can be done to make writing French easier. Overall, the experience of writing French is similar to what I was used to with English, except for spell checking and inserting characters that are not present in English (e.g. &amp;#231;, &amp;#224;, œ, etc.).</description>
