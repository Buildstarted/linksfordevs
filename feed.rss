      <link>https://glandium.org/blog/?p=4346</link>
      <description>Did you hear the news? Firefox development is moving from Mercurial to Git. While the decision is far from being mine, and I was barely involved in the small incremental changes that ultimately led to this decision, I feel I have to take at least some responsibility. And if you are one of those who would rather use Mercurial than Git, you may direct all your ire at me.</description>

      <title>Stephen Kotkin's Hopeful Future for the West - Rik's Weblog</title>
      <link>https://huijzer.xyz/posts/71</link>
      <description>In 2017, Stephen Kotkin gave a 5 hour long talk about Spheres of Influence at the IWM Vienna.
The talk is long not because he repeats the same ideas, but because he doesn't give conclusions.
As I see it, his talks clearly step through both sides of an argument and then leave it up to the audience to decide what to believe; largely in-line with the Socratic method.
One part of the talk stood out to me:
he said that the West does not have a clear hopeful picture for the future anymore.</description>

      <description>Branch Privilege Injection (CVE-2024-45332) brings back the full might of branch target injection attacks (Spectre-BTI) on Intel. Intel‚Äôs hardware mitigations against these types of attacks have held their ground for almost 6 years. In our work, we demonstrate how these mitigations can be broken due to a race condition in Intel CPUs.</description>
