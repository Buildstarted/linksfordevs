      <title>Formatting Strings with JavaScript Padstart and Padend Functions</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quC7fIO6A1U</link>
      <description>If you need to format a string to be a certain length, the built-in JavaScript padStart and padEnd functions will do just that. With JavaScript padStart and padEnd, you pass two parameters: one for the desired length of the padded string, and one for the character you want to pad your string with.

      <title>Stealing your SMS messages with iOS 0day</title>
      <link>https://wojciechregula.blog/post/stealing-your-sms-messages-with-ios-0day/</link>
      <description>This is a special post because I fully based on another researcher, s1guza&amp;rsquo;s 0day. All of this story began from the following tweet:
Siguza told us that his 0day was patched in the iOS 13.5 beta3. So this is actually a sandbox escape 0day for the newest, non-beta iOS version (13.4.1). In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I reproduced that bug and wrote a malicious application that uses that 0day to steal the iMessage history!</description>

      <title>PHP showing its maturity in release 7.4</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/818973/507f4b5e09ab9870/</link>
      <description>This year PHP turned 25 and, as with all things, the hope is that with age comes
wisdom and maturity. Often derided as a great way to write bad (and
insecure) code, PHP is hard to ignore completely when it is used in nearly
eight out of ten
websites. With PHP 7.4.5 released in
April, it's worthwhile to take a 
look at modern PHP, how it has evolved to address the criticisms of the
past, and what lies ahead in its future.</description>

      <description>In a perfect world, all of your EF Queries will be simplistic and not require complex logic, and the EF system itself will generate high-quality &amp; performant queries in the process. Sadly, this utopia doesn't exist; however, tools are available, including PredicateBuilder that makes things work well with minimal effort.</description>

      <link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/04/29/why-strace-doesnt-work-in-docker/</link>
      <description>While editing the capabilities page of the how containers work zine, I found myself trying to explain why strace doesn’t work in a Docker container.
The problem here is – if I run strace in a Docker container on my laptop, this happens:
$ docker run -it ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash $ # ... install strace ... root@e27f594da870:/# strace ls strace: ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, ...): Operation not permitted  strace works using the ptrace system call, so if ptrace isn’t allowed, it’s definitely not gonna work!</description>
