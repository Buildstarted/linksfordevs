      <title>Why cancer cells waste so much energy</title>
      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2021/cancer-cells-waste-energy-0115</link>
      <description>MIT biologists have found a possible explanation for the Warburg effect, first seen in cancer cells in the 1920s. They found cancer cells use fermentation, an inefficient metabolic pathway, because it helps them to generate large quantities of a molecule called NAD+, which they need to synthesize DNA and other important molecules.</description>

      <description>I founded the curl project early 1998 but had already then been working on the code since November 1996. The source code was always open, free and available to the world.

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Jan/14/Taking-the-new-Chromium-WebView2-Control-for-a-Spin-in-NET-Part-1</link>
      <description>This is Part 1 of a two part article that gives an overview of the new WebView2 Web browser control that is based on Edge Chromium. In Part 1 I look at the basics of what&amp;#39;s needed to run the control using the WebView runtime, and how to get the control embedded and configured to use for basic HTML tasks. In Part 2 I look at interaction between the .NET application and WebBrowser and Javascript.</description>
