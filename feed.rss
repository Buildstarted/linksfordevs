      <description>TL-DR version: If you ever change your email address, and you lose access to your old email address, you&amp;#39;ll no longer be able to reset your T-Mobile Money password via email. If you&amp;#39;re not a T-Mobile
Wireless customer, you won&amp;#39;t be able to reset your password via text message either. So, you may lose the ability to reset your password altogether.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn Safety Series: What is scraping?</title>
      <link>https://blog.linkedin.com/2021/july/15/linkedin-safety-series-what-is-scraping</link>
      <description>For our members to have the best possible experience, we want to keep them safe. We work every day to protect our members’ data and their ability to control the information they post on LinkedIn. Our Global Trust Teams create, deploy, and maintain models that detect and prevent abuse, stop attacks, thwart scams and generally limit the bad stuff that exists on the internet from ever reaching our members. Much of the detail on how companies do this has stayed behind the scenes, but we want to peel back the curtain in this first post in a series of safety topics.</description>

      <title>Gentle introduction to GPUs inner workings</title>
      <link>https://vksegfault.github.io/posts/gentle-intro-gpu-inner-workings/</link>
      <description>This article summarizes some lower level aspect of how GPU executes. Although GPU programming is not that complicated when compared to CPU, it also doesn’t match to what hardware is doing exactly. The reason is that we can’t just program GPU without some API, which is an abstraction over its inner workings. Since few years now, we have modern explicit APIs like DirectX 12 or Vulkan, which shrunken the gap to what is happening with hardware. Yet there still are few low-level bits (pun intended) that are worth explaining.</description>

      <description>The Martians of Budapest”, sometimes referred to as simply “The Martians” is a colloquial term used to describe a group of prominent Hungarian physicists and mathematicians who emigrated to the United States following the Great Purge of 1933. The term refers to—what appeared, from the perspective of Americans—to be a group of men with superhuman intellects, arriving from an obscure country speaking an incomprehensible foreign language and English with strong, characteristic accents (later popularized by Bela Lugosi in Dracula)</description>

      <description>An example-driven guide to building reusable UI components and web frontends—all with Blazor, C#, and .NET.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

Blazor, a powerful C#-based frontend framework from Microsoft, makes it easy to create fast rich web applications without the limitations of typical JavaScript-based tools. Blazor components seamlessly blend C# and standard HTML markup, so you can build web frontends using the same technology as your server-side code. With Blazor WebAssembly, you can also run your C# code natively in the browser.</description>
