      <title>How does PLONK work? Part 9: What&amp;#39;s a polynomial commitment scheme (PCS)?</title>

      <description>In this ninth video, I explain what polynomial commitment schemes are as well as their API. I also mention the Kate polynomial commitment scheme (KZG), based on pairings, and bootle/bulletproof types of polynomial commitments schemes, based on inner products.

      <title>Pi-Challenge - world record attempt by UAS Grisons</title>
      <link>https://www.fhgr.ch/en/specialist-areas/applied-future-technologies/davis-centre/pi-challenge/#c16197</link>
      <description>The calculation of Pi is an unofficial benchmark in high-performance computing. For this, the expertise is especially important to set up the hardware correctly, to match it to the software used and to run the computation for weeks without interference. The Centre for Data Analysis, Visualisation and Simulation (DAViS) has taken on this challenge.</description>

      <description>In this eighth video, I explain how the prover and the verifier can perform a &amp;quot;polynomial dance&amp;quot; in order to construct the circuit polynomial $f$. The principle is simple: the prover doesn&amp;#39;t want to leak information about the private inputs and the intermediary values in the circuit, and the verifier doesn&amp;#39;t want to give the prover too much freedom in the way they construct the circuit polynomial  ...</description>

      <link>https://www.roji.org/parameters-batching-and-sql-rewriting</link>
      <description>In the upcoming version 6.0 of the Npgsql PostgreSQL driver for .NET, we implemented what I think of as “raw mode” (#3852). In a nutshell, this means that you can now use Npgsql without it doing anything to the SQL you provide it - it will simply send your queries as-is to PostgreSQL, without parsing or rewriting them in any way. Explaining what this means is a great opportunity to go into some interesting aspects of database programming - so let’s dive in.</description>

      <description>In this fifth video, I explain how we can &amp;quot;compile&amp;quot; an arithmetic circuit into something PLONK can understand: a constraint system. Specifically, a PLONK-flavored constraint system, which is a series of equations that must if equal to zero correctly describe our program (or circuit).

      <description>The upcoming release of ASP.NET Core 6 brings a pretty interesting feature set referred to as “Minimal APIs”. While they seem pretty interesting to me and many others, some folks are not fans and can be quite vocal about it, so I thought about taking quick look, put things in perspective, as well as compare with other tech stacks.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/534/how-does-plonk-work-part-6-from-constraint-systems-to-polynomials/</link>
      <description>In this sixth video, I explain the compilation, or even compression, of a set of equations into a single polynomial. That polynomial represents all of our constraints, as long as it vanishes in an agreed set of points. With a polynomial in hand, we will be able to create a protocol with our polynomial-based proof system.

      <title>Mastodon now a non-profit organisation</title>
      <link>https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/08/mastodon-now-a-non-profit-organisation/</link>
      <description>In June, I was able to officially register Mastodon gGmbH after nearly 8 months of legal work (“gGmbH” means “non-profit limited liability company”). A non-profit limited liability company in Germany is structered and operates similarly to a for-profit limited liability company with a few key differences. The founding document of the company is written such that the activity of the company is working towards goals that benefit the public; the shareholders may not receive any revenue from the company’s activities and can at most withdraw the funds that they originally paid in; employees may not receive extraordinarily high wages; and the company can receive donations which are then tax-free, although any other income that does not fit the definition of a donation continues to incur various taxes.</description>

      <title>Debugging External Sources with Visual Studio</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugging-external-sources-with-visual-studio/</link>
      <description>Have you ever needed to debug and step into a code of dependent NuGet or .NET libraries that do not build as part of your solution? Today, debugging through them is not so easy as debugging your projects that are part of your solution. Starting with Visual Studio 2022 Preview 3, we are adding a new &amp;quot;External Sources&amp;quot; node in the Solution Explorer which will make debugging external sources files much easier. This node appears while debugging and will show sources for managed modules with symbols loaded containing Source Link or Source Server information. You can effortlessly browse those sources files and debug through them by placing breakpoints if needed.</description>
