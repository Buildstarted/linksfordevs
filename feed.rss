      <description>Recently, we wanted to dig into how users feel about copying and pasting a URL from their browser. We looked to understand what they do when they copy and paste URLs, as well as the pain points they experience.   What did we find?

      <title>Home - History of .NET</title>
      <link>https://historyofdot.net/</link>
      <description>Back in 2017, there was a party celebrating the 15th anniversary of .NET shipping.
                    I had the opportunity to do some short interviews with folks at the party that were part of .NET way back at the beginning.
                    You can see some of those interviews on Channel 9 at Happy Birthday .NET!
                    After the evening was over, it occured to me that we needed to write these stories down before they get lost.
                    That was the beginning of what has evolved into a multi-year effort to collect the tales that led to the creation and evolution of .NET.
                    The book has been coming for awhile now, sign up here to be kept up-to-date on its development and the many stories behind creating it!</description>

      <title>Why I Link to WayBackMachine Instead of Original Site</title>
      <link>https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/</link>
      <description>When linking to a page for the purpose of reference, it seems better to me to link to the archive of a given page, rather than to the original site itself.
This ensures that after some years have gone by, my article is guaranteed to be consistent. Due the changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:
 404 / Not Found (most common) Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</description>

      <description>There are lots of options when building React applications so where do you start? Create React App is probably the most common starting point, but have you looked at Next.js and Gatsby? They are two frameworks built on top of React that bring features like building State Pages, Server Side Rendered Pages, built-in routing, etc.

      <title>Update noda time plugin to support bcl types by forwarding these to the existing bcl type handlers. by davidroth · Pull Request #3124 · npgsql/npgsql</title>
      <link>https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/pull/3124</link>
      <description>This is a fix so that noda types can co-exist with bcl types until clean support for multiple type handlers will be implemented.

      <title>Tooltips in tooltips · Philip Ardeljan is a UI designer</title>
      <link>https://philip.design/blog/tooltips-in-tooltips/</link>
      <description>With the recent release of Crusader Kings 3 by Paradox Interactive, a new UI paradigm in the game stopped me in my tracks. There are a lot of lessons that web designers can learn from video game user interface design and while they aren’t always transferrable, they are worth exploring. In this case it’s the idea of having tooltips within tooltips.</description>

      <title>Tinkerer - You Aren't Going To Need It</title>
      <link>https://www.gustavwengel.dk/yagni-yet</link>
      <description>You’re on a project. You’re developing an API to count the amount of apples in a cart. You expect to have it done, and people using it in 6 months.
Obviously this API needs to be documented, after all you don’t want your consumers to have to guess how it works.
You all agree, that when writing a new endpoint you’ll document it properly.
Four months later it’s looking good - you have a bunch of endpoints that are beautifully documented.</description>

Let me explain.</description>
