      <title>Apple’s Browser Engine Ban Persists, Even Under the DMA - Open Web Advocacy</title>
      <link>https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/apples-browser-engine-ban-persists-even-under-the-dma/</link>
      <description>TL;DR: Apple’s rules and technical restrictions are blocking other browser vendors from successfully offering their own engines to users in the EU.

      <title>How to do Validation in Windows and Uno Platform Applications - the Easy Way - Nick's .NET Travels</title>
      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/winui-validation/</link>
      <description>Quite often I hear the complaint that WinUI, and thus Uno Platform, doesn’t include validation. There was some evidence a while ago that it was being worked on by the WinUI team (ie commented out validation XAML in the WinUI styles), but there doesn’t seem to be any more progress in this area, despite a ...
