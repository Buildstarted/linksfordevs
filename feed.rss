      <title>How we upgrade a live data center</title>
      <link>https://blog.serverfault.com/2015/03/05/how-we-upgrade-a-live-data-center/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago we upgraded a lot of the core infrastructure in our New York (okay, it’s really in New Jersey now – but don’t tell anyone) data center. We love being open with everything we do (including infrastructure), and really consider it one of the best job perks we have. So here’s how and why we upgrade a data center. First, take a moment to look at what Stack Overflow started as.&amp;#160;It’s 5 years later and hardware has come a long way.</description>

      <description>In this series:
 Distributed Tracing with Jaeger Simplifying the setup with Tye (this article)   Tye is an experimental dotnet tool from Microsoft that aims to make developing, testing, and deploying microservices easier. Tye’s opinionated nature greatly simplifies the lifecycle of development and deployment of .NET Core microservices.
To understand the benefits of Tye, let’s enumerate the steps involved in the development and deployment of the DCalculator application to Kubernetes:</description>

      <description>A fairly hectic week this one, in a large part due to chasing down really flakey network issues that are causing devices (namely Shelly relays) to be inaccessible.

      <description>Estimating a simple task isn’t a problem. The problems arise when the task is complex and unclear. Sometimes I have to estimate complex tasks to measure the sprint time or other activities. To estimate such tasks I have developed my approach over time.</description>

      <title>How to Learn Nix, Part 1: What&amp;#39;s all this about?</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/introduction/</link>
      <description>Five years ago, I migrated my VPS from Arch Linux to NixOS.
I had no idea what I was doing. I had never used Nix before. I thought I could figure it out.
Five years later, I’m still running NixOS. And I still have no idea how it works.</description>

      <title>Measure and reduce keyboard input latency with QMK on the Kinesis Advantage</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-05-08-keyboard-input-latency-qmk-kinesis/</link>
      <description>Over the last few years, I worked on a few projects around keyboard input latency:
In 2018, I introduced the kinX keyboard controller with 0.2ms of input latency.
In 2020, I introduced the kinT keyboard controller, which works with a wide range of Teensy micro controllers, and both the old KB500 and the newer KB600 Kinesis Advantage models.</description>

      <title>My email workflow in Fastmail - Piet van Zoen</title>
      <link>https://piet.me/my-email-workflow-in-fastmail/</link>
      <description>When I switched to Fastmail from Hey, there were elements of Hey&amp;#39;s approach that worked well for me and I wanted to replicate. I found several articles about setting up a Hey workflow with Fastmail, but the suggested setup relied on creating custom rules for each contact and I found this to be cumbersome. I figured out a slightly different approach and wanted to document what I ended up with.</description>
