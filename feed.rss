      <title>Facebook’s Dominance Is Built on Anti-Competitive Behavior</title>
      <link>https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/facebook-s-dominance-is-built-on-anti-competitive-behavior</link>
      <description>Facebook and its subsidiaries, including Instagram, account for 75% of all time spent on social media. In a new paper, Yale SOM economist Fiona Scott Morton writes that the company took control of the industry by misleading consumers and buying up rivals. Scott Morton is the founder and director of the Thurman Arnold Project at Yale, which performs and disseminates research on antitrust policy and enforcement. </description>

      <title>Terminology, Power and Oppressive Language</title>
      <link>https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html</link>
      <description>This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift specific language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to avoid oppressive terminology in the technical documentation of the RFC series. Specifically, this document details two sets of terms that are normalised on the technical level but oppressive on a societal level. First, arguments are presented for why any oppressive terms should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF. Second, problem statements for both sets of terms are presented and alternatives are proposed. There is a third section on additional considerations and general action points to address the RFC series, past and future. Lastly, a summary of recommendations is presented.</description>
