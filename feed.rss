      <title>Milk Kanban</title>
      <link>https://brodzinski.com/2025/03/milk-kanban.html</link>
      <description>Original meaning of Kanban is that it’s a visual signal. We tend to think about Kanban in terms of boards, columns, index cards, etc.  However, in principle, none of that is needed to design a Kanban system.</description>

      <title>The COST of double-entry accounting</title>
      <link>https://aivarsk.com/2025/03/14/The-COST-of-double-entry-accounting/</link>
      <description>Sometimes I think the most important paper of our times is Scalability! But at what COST? We build “web-scale” systems and get excited about how scalable they are and how we solve the problems of scale, but we do not measure the COST: Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread. We lack reasonable, well-done single-threaded implementations for different domains. One of which is ledger and accounting.</description>

      <title>Should we replace Spark with DuckDB?</title>
      <link>https://valatka.dev/2025/02/11/replace-spark-with-duckdb.html</link>
      <description>I was attending a DuckDB meetup in Leuven, where a presenter was detailing how they replaced Spark with DuckDB to cut costs, when rather abruptly, someone in the audience asked, “How do I know if I should really use DuckDB now, me being not a data engineer? What if my query is heavier than expected? What if my data fluctuates and just sometimes goes beyond a single machine?”. The presenter admitted that you set up the architecture once, do your best benchmarking, and hope for the data dynamics to stay the same.</description>
