      <description>There was a SEV review meeting once upon a time, and in it, we had 
reviewed some incident where something bad happened involving something 
that ran as root.  I don&amp;#39;t remember the finer points of that one any 
more, but the resident VP who ran the show wondered aloud how much 
&amp;quot;root exposure&amp;quot; we had in our infra in general.  That got my attention.</description>

      <title>How good is Codex?</title>
      <link>https://smitop.com/post/codex/</link>
      <description>OpenAI recently released Codex (paper), a large-scale language generation model trained on public programming source code from GitHub. Its most prominent use so far is GitHub Copilot, which is an extension for VSCode1 that autocompletes code being edited. However, there are many uses for Codex beyond code completion. OpenAI recently ran the OpenAI Codex Challenge, where competitors were tasked with solving various programming tasks, and could use Codex to help them. I participated in the challenge and got 75th place2. Due to some overloaded servers during the challenge, many people were unable to actually do actually compete, so that ranking is mostly due to me figuring out the best times to reload to get the challenge to work. After the challenge, OpenAI sent me an invite to try out the Codex model, which I used to do the testing in the post.</description>

      <title>Computers Are Bad</title>
      <link>https://computer.rip/2021-08-16-on-voting.html</link>
      <description>The use of electronics to administer elections has been controversial for some
time. Since the &amp;quot;hanging chads&amp;quot; of the 2000 election, there&amp;#39;s been some degree
of public awareness of the use of technology for voting and its possible
impacts on the accuracy and integrity of the election. The exact nature of the
controversy has been through several generations, though, reflecting both
changes in election technology and changes in the political climate.</description>

      <title>WebView and Modal Dialogs in WPF Async Code</title>

      <description>Another day another problem with the WebView control - this time dealing with certain Windows dialogs crashing the WebView control and making it unresponsive so that the control has to be reloaded or - more commonly the application has to be restarted.</description>

      <title>How does PLONK work? Part 9: What&amp;#39;s a polynomial commitment scheme (PCS)?</title>

      <description>In this ninth video, I explain what polynomial commitment schemes are as well as their API. I also mention the Kate polynomial commitment scheme (KZG), based on pairings, and bootle/bulletproof types of polynomial commitments schemes, based on inner products.

      <title>Pi-Challenge - world record attempt by UAS Grisons</title>
      <link>https://www.fhgr.ch/en/specialist-areas/applied-future-technologies/davis-centre/pi-challenge/#c16197</link>
      <description>The calculation of Pi is an unofficial benchmark in high-performance computing. For this, the expertise is especially important to set up the hardware correctly, to match it to the software used and to run the computation for weeks without interference. The Centre for Data Analysis, Visualisation and Simulation (DAViS) has taken on this challenge.</description>

      <description>Some 10 years after the final Microsoft Silverlight release, some developers still fear being &amp;#39;Silverlighted,&amp;#39; or seeing a development product in which they have invested heavily be abandoned by Microsoft.</description>

      <description>In this eighth video, I explain how the prover and the verifier can perform a &amp;quot;polynomial dance&amp;quot; in order to construct the circuit polynomial $f$. The principle is simple: the prover doesn&amp;#39;t want to leak information about the private inputs and the intermediary values in the circuit, and the verifier doesn&amp;#39;t want to give the prover too much freedom in the way they construct the circuit polynomial  ...</description>

      <title>Query parameters, batching and SQL rewriting</title>
      <link>https://www.roji.org/parameters-batching-and-sql-rewriting</link>
      <description>In the upcoming version 6.0 of the Npgsql PostgreSQL driver for .NET, we implemented what I think of as “raw mode” (#3852). In a nutshell, this means that you can now use Npgsql without it doing anything to the SQL you provide it - it will simply send your queries as-is to PostgreSQL, without parsing or rewriting them in any way. Explaining what this means is a great opportunity to go into some interesting aspects of database programming - so let’s dive in.</description>

      <title>How does PLONK work? Part 5: From arithmetic circuits to constraint systems</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/533/how-does-plonk-work-part-5-from-arithmetic-circuits-to-constraint-systems/</link>
      <description>In this fifth video, I explain how we can &amp;quot;compile&amp;quot; an arithmetic circuit into something PLONK can understand: a constraint system. Specifically, a PLONK-flavored constraint system, which is a series of equations that must if equal to zero correctly describe our program (or circuit).

      <title>[Video] Are ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs just for demos?</title>
      <link>https://blog.codingmilitia.com/2021/08/17/are-aspnet-core-6-minimal-apis-just-for-demos/</link>
      <description>The upcoming release of ASP.NET Core 6 brings a pretty interesting feature set referred to as “Minimal APIs”. While they seem pretty interesting to me and many others, some folks are not fans and can be quite vocal about it, so I thought about taking quick look, put things in perspective, as well as compare with other tech stacks.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/534/how-does-plonk-work-part-6-from-constraint-systems-to-polynomials/</link>
      <description>In this sixth video, I explain the compilation, or even compression, of a set of equations into a single polynomial. That polynomial represents all of our constraints, as long as it vanishes in an agreed set of points. With a polynomial in hand, we will be able to create a protocol with our polynomial-based proof system.
