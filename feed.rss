      <title>C# 9 records as strongly-typed ids - Part 4: Entity Framework Core integration</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/12/23/csharp-9-records-as-strongly-typed-ids-part-4-entity-framework-core-integration/</link>
      <description>So far in this series, I showed how to use C# 9 records to declare strongly-typed ids as easily as this:
public record ProductId(int Value) : StronglyTypedId&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;(Value); I also explained how to make them work correctly with ASP.NET Core model binding and JSON serialization.
Today, I’ll present another piece of the puzzle: how to make Entity Framework core handle strongly-typed ids correctly.
Value conversion for a specific strongly-typed id Out of the box, EF Core doesn’t know anything about our strongly-typed ids.</description>

      <title>Introduction to quantum computing with Q# – Part 11, EPR Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2020/12/introduction-to-quantum-computing-with-q-part-11-epr-quantum-key-distribution/</link>
      <description>In the last two posts we covered quantum key exchange using the B92 and BB84 protocols. Both of those depended with their security on the no-cloning theorem. Today we are going to dedicate a third post to the topic of quantum key distribution, and this time around we will explore a variant of key distribution relying on the phenomenon of entanglement and quantum correlations.</description>

      <description>We continue our exercise of emulating the REG_NOTIFY_THREAD_AGNOSTIC flag, this time for the case where we don’t have a readily-available persistent thread. In that case, we can use one from the thread pool, but it’ll be a bit trickier because we’ll have to wait for the thread pool work item to run in order to get the result.</description>
