      <title>Pixel Art Tutorials - Saint11</title>
      <link>https://saint11.org/blog/pixel-art-tutorials/</link>
      <description>This is my series of tutorials that I made with the help of my Patrons, they are all 512x512 pixels and were primarily focussed on twitter but eventually became it’s own thing. All these tutorials are free, but if you want to support me, you can do it on Patreon or you can buy them in a nice .zip file on Itch.io.
If you want to Ctrl+F (Cmd+F in mac) to find something, I added some tags to the titles to help with that, I also added a ‘#’ symbol before each tag.</description>

      <title>How to Transform Your Board Meeting with Written Narratives by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/written-board-meetings/</link>
      <description>Written materials transform board meetings. With most of us working remotely, many startups have thrown out Google slides and replaced them with Google docs. It’s a fundamental change, and one I hope persists after work returns to the new normal.
Amazon is famous for its narrative process and contempt of slides. The email in which Bezos banishes decks reads:
“The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than ‘writing’ a 20 page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what how things are related.</description>

      <title>The Power of Defaults</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/power_of_defaults/</link>
      <description>I use every ounce of willpower to keep still. One wrong move might wreak
havoc. After carefully assessing the situation, I move my mouse over the
right option, select it, and press ‘Next’. Crisis narrowly averted, I am
now confronting the next set of inane settings—until finally, this
installation of Windows 10 is finished. Midway along the process, I
ask myself whether the designers of the setup process are aware that the
majority of users will probably select the defaults, thus making it easy
for Microsoft to use extra diagnostic data, install additional software,
and decrease the user’s privacy even further. Welcome to 2020!</description>

      <title>Save the world with a personal carbon tax</title>
      <link>https://blog.iamhamy.xyz/posts/consider-a-personal-carbon-tax/</link>
      <description>This half, some of my goals are to raise money and awareness for climate change and to reduce my carbon footprint by 10%.
In the past I’ve done this by changing my diet and paying a carbon tax. Recently I’ve been intrigued by the power of economic motivators as an agent of behavior change and particularly how I could utilize those motivators myself.
One thing I’ve been thinking about recently is to expand my personal carbon tax to help encourage myself to make better decisions and to make up for those decisions when I make a poor choice.</description>

      <link>https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/07/etcd-or-why-modern-software-makes-me-sad/</link>
      <description>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called etcd which was a really lightweight database written around the Raft consensus algorithm. This tool was originally written in 2013 for a bullshit unsuccessful project called CoreOS Container Linux that was EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store behind …</description>

      <title>How to Run a Live Coding Stream on Twitch using OBS</title>
      <link>https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/</link>
      <description>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable, immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</description>

      <title>Ex-Googler's Startup Comes Out of Stealth With Beautifully Simple, Clever Robot Design - IEEE Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/hello-robots-stretch-mobile-manipulator</link>
      <description>Over the last 10 years, the PR2 has helped roboticists make an enormous amount of progress in mobile manipulation over a relatively short time. I mean, it’s been a decade already, but still—robots are hard, and giving a bunch of smart people access to a capable platform where they didn’t have to worry about hardware and could instead focus on doing interesting and useful things helped to establish a precedent for robotics research going forward.</description>

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Jul/12/Handling-SPA-Fallback-Paths-in-a-Generic-ASPNET-Core-Server</link>
      <description>When building ASP.NET Core backends for SPA applications one thing that you have to worry about is how to handle client side routes that end up being fired against the server through external or reloaded links. While ASp.NET Core has built-in support for this if you build a generic Web server, you might need a little more control on how to handle the Fallback routing functionality. Here's how.</description>

      <description>We are constantly dealing with libraries and NuGet packages. These libraries depend on other popular libraries and there are a lot of shared dependencies. With a large enough web of dependencies, you'll eventually get into conflicts or hard situations. The best way to deal with such issues is to understand how the mechanism works internally.</description>
