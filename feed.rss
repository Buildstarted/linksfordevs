      <title>.NET Rocks! IoT Development using Particle Photon with Colleen Lavin</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1863</link>
      <description>What can you do with a Particle Photon? While in an aluminum Airstream trailer in a thunderstorm at the Copenhagen Developers Festival, Carl and Richard talked to Colleen Lavin about her work with the Particle Photon IoT device - and its many maker possibilities! Colleen talks about making it easy to start building a device - but the struggle with so many choices to actually pick a project. The conversation also digs into making production versions of your device so that they are smaller, cheaper, and very reliable - it&amp;#39;s a fun time to be a maker!</description>

      <description>In this article, we will build a minimal version of what ASP.NET Core does - yes, you read right. We will create a very simplistic clone of ASP.NET Core to discuss how the whole thing works. Beginning with a simple console application, we will add the necessary components to make it work as a web server. Bonus points for our own middleware pipeline and dependency injection.

      <title>Exploring the expander from .NET MAUI Community Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/exploring-the-expander-from-net-maui-community-toolkit/</link>
      <description>Imagine designing a user interface filled with distinct elements, each boasting its unique header and intricate details. To achieve a streamlined visual layout and save space, consider displaying only the headers and revealing the details upon selection. With the Expander control from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit, this vision is entirely attainable. Join me, and I&amp;#39;ll guide you step-by-step to a implementation. &amp;#128149;
The explanation will be divided into the following points:


&amp;#128313; .NET MAUI Community Toolkit: Implementation
&amp;#128313; &amp;#160;What is a Expander?
&amp;#128313; &amp;#160;How to implement it?




&amp;#128295;&amp;#160;First of all... What do I need to know?
What is .NET MAUI Community Toolkit??

 	It’s a collection of reusable elements such as animations, behaviors &amp;#160;converters, among others, for developing applications for iOS, Android, macOS and WinUI using MAUI.

✍️ Important!&amp;#160;Adding this configuration to your project just once is enough to fully benefit from the Community Toolkit. If you&amp;#39;ve already implemented it using another NuGet feature, feel free to skip this step.



[expand title=&amp;#128295; Still haven&amp;#39;t implemented it? Check it here!

]

 	Add from NuGet Package: Community.Toolkit.Maui



 	Now let’s initialize:&amp;#160;Go to your MauiProgram.cs file

In the CreateMauiApp method, place in the .UseMauiApp&amp;lt;App&amp;gt;()&amp;#160;line and just below it add the following line of code:



⚠ Don’t forget to add the using CommunityToolkit.Maui;at the top of the class.

[/expand]

 	Finally, add the following namespace:





Let&amp;#39;s start!
What is a Expander?
The Expander serves as an expandable container which is composed of a header (the content visible before expansion) and a container, designed to hold the detailed content linked to each header.




How to implement it?&amp;#160;
In order to show the Expander on screen, you must utilize two elements: The Header and The Content. Each one of these includes specific properties that help in the Expander configuration.
Let&amp;#39;s see a preview of what the structure should be like, and consequently we will start detailing the explanation.


However, before delving into incorporating the two previously mentioned elements, it is important to add the tags that will house them. To establish this foundation, you simply need to integrate the following tags provided below:





&amp;#128313; Header
The header remains constantly in view, and a simple click or tap will expand or hide the content. Ensure you populate it with read-only material, steering clear of controls demanding further user engagement.
Exactly where it says &amp;lt;!-- The Header element goes here--&amp;gt; in the previous block, add the &amp;lt;Expander.Header&amp;gt; tags, here&amp;#160;you can add all the visual elements you need, for this example I have only added a Label.


&amp;#128313; Content
The content is what the user will see when interacting with the header, fluidly alternating between its visibility and hiding each time the header is selected.
The integration is intuitive and you do not need additional tags. Once you&amp;#39;ve set your header tags, simply add an element to hold the detailed content. For this example I will use the VerticalStackLayout, within the layout I can add all the visual elements I need.

&amp;#128683; Limitations
➖ Expander does not support ListView on iOS/MacCatalyst.




And done! &amp;#128526; From now on, you are ready to use Expander in your .NET MAUI applications! &amp;#128154;&amp;#128149;

&amp;lt;Label Text=”Thanks for reading!&amp;#160;&amp;#128075; ” /&amp;gt;

      <link>https://www.richardanaya.com/p/the-psycho-epistemological-nature</link>
      <description>Individuals within software development organizations display a great diversity of competency for different tasks. There are various aspects of these people that contribute toward their competency: experience, passion, and by far the most significant dimension - familiarity with organizational tasks. Familiarity with tasks is shown pronouncedly in a class of developers known as subject matter experts (SME). In this article, I will discuss what is essential to SMEs, how they are formed, and how managers can enable their creation through process design.</description>

ADSL, the website milliondollarhomepage.com was

displaying the Internet billboard of 2005, frozen in time.</description>

      <description>If you often use CSS variables (custom properties),
    you may have found the code referenced by var()
    looks less shining or readable, particularly combined with calc() functions.
    Not only because the expression is usually long,
    the prefixed double hypens -- also diminish the readability.</description>
