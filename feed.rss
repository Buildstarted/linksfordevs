      <title>| Meritocracy vs TopocracyMichele Coscia</title>
      <link>https://www.michelecoscia.com/?p=2205</link>
      <description>The world isn’t always fair. Perhaps you know the frustration of pouring your heart into making something extraordinary, only to see it almost completely ignored by the crowd. On the other hand, celebrities are constantly talked about, even when they are ostensibly doing very little — if anything at all. Your clever lyrics and innovative musical composition lie in the obscure shadow of a pop idol singing “let’s go party” over the same riff used by dozens of clones. Is it just you, or is there an actual force causing this to happen? This is an interesting question I decided to study together with Clara Vandeweerdt.</description>

      <title>The Lens Of Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://blog.kerryjones.net/posts/the-lens-of-asymmetry/</link>
      <description>The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) claims that if an investor wants higher rewards they must take greater risk. This belief in the symmetry of the public market is one of the pillars of EMH. The idea that you can find an investment that is low-risk and high-reward, on the other hand, would be asymmetrical.</description>
