      <description>For more than 15 years I&amp;#39;ve built my own &amp;quot;Home Automation&amp;quot; components. Nothing fancy, though maybe back then it was. It started with some colored LED spots under my couch connected to my Ethernet via a micro controller.
Later I added WiFi and 433MHz radio to control various remote switchable outlets. Some of them even were built into a light switch to control it. I even had Linux running in a light switch for some time.
Then came my MagicMirror and with it the need for some presence detection based on WiFi. And so on, just to give you an introduction as to where this is coming from.</description>

      <link>https://nick-black.com/dankwiki/index.php?title=PC_Fans</link>
      <description>Fans, an active cooling element, move air in a system. Heat must be removed from the site of its production, and from the system as a whole. A fan increases heat convection with surrounding air via airflow. Air is at its highest pressure immediately in front of the fan, and at lowest pressure immediately behind it.</description>
