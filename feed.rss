      <title>Unit Testing Clean Architecture Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/unit-testing-clean-architecture-use-cases</link>
      <description>Drawing from years of experience, I share my battle-tested approach to unit testing Clean Architecture use cases in .NET, focusing on the critical balance between code coverage and test quality. Through practical examples and real-world scenarios, I&amp;#39;ll demonstrate how to write effective tests that not only catch bugs but also provide confidence in your code deployments.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Network Programming: The Backbone of Modern Applications - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/demystifying-network-programming-the-backbone-of-modern-applications/</link>
      <description>Network programming might sound intimidating, but at its core, it’s the art of making applications talk to each other. Whether it’s your favorite messaging app sending texts in real-time or your smartwatch syncing health stats to your phone, network programming is the magic behind it all. It’s not just a technical skill—it’s the backbone of our interconnected digital world.</description>

      <title>Building Webhooks in .NET: Adding PostgreSQL Database Storage (part 2)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=nbDYwxIeivs</link>

Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt
Join a community of 1000+ .NET developers: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic

In Part 1, we built a Webhooks system that worked great but lost all data when the app restarted. Now we&amp;#39;re adding PostgreSQL to store both webhook subscriptions and delivery attempts, making our system production-ready and resilient. We&amp;#39;ll walk through the full database implementation, including entity design, repository pattern setup, and proper error handling. This is a practical, no-nonsense guide to adding persistence to your Webhook system in .NET.

      <title>Be A Property Owner And Not A Renter On The Internet</title>
      <link>https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/</link>
      <description>The year is 2025. The internet in the shape that we&amp;#39;ve known it in the early 2000s is no longer there. Or, not quite in the shape that we&amp;#39;ve seen it before. This is not just plain nostalgia talking - the vibrant ecosystem of blogs, feeds, personal sites, and forums has been usurped by a few mega-concentrated players.</description>

      <title>What&amp;#39;s one benefit of the mediator design pattern?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ehhzObzt1D0</link>
      <description>The mediator design pattern helps to decouple communication between different parts of your system.

In a hypothetical C# project, that would mean that you don&amp;#39;t need to know about the type or the instance of the destination you want your message to go to. You don&amp;#39;t really need to know anything concrete about the destination because you&amp;#39;ll never have one module talk directly to another!

Instead, we route things through the mediator. The mediator has the responsibility of knowing how to take incoming messages and get them to the right destinations. This means that we use the mediator&amp;#39;s API to communicate, and not necessarily the API of the destination directly.

      <title>I am rich and have no idea what to do with my life</title>
      <link>https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/</link>
      <description>Life has been a haze this last year. After selling my company, I find myself in the totally un-relatable position of never having to work again. Everything feels like a side quest, but not in an inspiring way. I don’t have the same base desires driving me to make money or gain status. I have infinite freedom, yet I don’t know what to do with it, and, honestly, I’m not the most optimistic about life.</description>
