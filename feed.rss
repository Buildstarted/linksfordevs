      <title>Why Can’t We Agree On What’s True? | Dr. Ian O&amp;#39;Byrne</title>
      <link>https://wiobyrne.com/why-cant-we-agree-on-whats-true/</link>
      <description>This is not as simple as distrust. Digital platforms and ubiquitous access to these spaces have ushered in a new public mindset that ends in a refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. This also includes being instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion.</description>

      <title>How to be miserable after a breakup</title>
      <link>https://kg.dev/thoughts/miserable-breakup</link>
      <description>1. Text her, often
You don&amp;#39;t want her to get away. There&amp;#39;s probably still hope. Whether you broke up with her or she with you, you need to try everything in your power to win her back. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if she isn&amp;#39;t responding -- be persistent.

If she asks you to stop texting her, start calling and leave voicemails. She&amp;#39;ll change her mind once she understands how committed you are.

2. Check her social media
You need to be on top of this one. As soon as she posts a story on Instagram, watch it. Let her know that you&amp;#39;re there and you care. Let her know you&amp;#39;re paying attention.

If she posts a picture, like it. If you&amp;#39;re feeling extra brave, leave a comment — just an emoji or two is enough. Anything to remind her that you&amp;#39;re still out there, thinking of her.

3. Drink and do drugs
Drinking is your friend. Alcohol is cheap and does wonders when trying to push the pain away. Maybe start with a fifth of vodka every night?

If you haven&amp;#39;t already, start doing drugs. But I&amp;#39;m not talking about weed — weed is for pussies. Buy cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine. Also, make sure you do all your drugs alone. Doing drugs with friends can sometimes be fun, but you don&amp;#39;t want that. You want to maximize misery.

If you remember what you did yesterday, you&amp;#39;re doing it wrong. Keep drinking.

4. Spend money
If you want to maximize misery, you will need to maximize financial problems. You&amp;#39;re a grown-up with multiple credit cards, which is basically unlimited money. Why sit on them?

5. Sleep around
This one should be obvious. You&amp;#39;re single, young, and don&amp;#39;t have to spend money on a girl anymore. Download all the dating apps and free up your weekends to go to bars and talk to girls.

The goal here is to push down your fear of being alone through meaningless sex. Also, don&amp;#39;t let them spend the night so that you can wake up all alone, questioning when you&amp;#39;ll ever find real love again. Now, back to swiping.

6. Drown yourself in work
But not in a healthy way. You want to be working at least 14 hours a day. This may sound difficult, but they have drugs for that now. Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Modafinil, etc. Get a prescription and start consuming. The good thing is that these drugs will suppress your hunger (and passion for anything else), so you can start skipping meals and have more time for work.

7. Make her jealous
Post pictures of you with other girls on Instagram. Book a vacation and share photos liberally. Start hitting on her friends -- this is a surefire way of getting her attention even if she isn&amp;#39;t looking at your social media.

Do whatever you can to get her attention and make her jealous. This endless pursuit to win her back will bring you misery, guaranteed.

Now, if you don&amp;#39;t want to be miserable after a breakup, do the exact opposite of everything above. Delete your social media, stop drinking, stop doing drugs, go to the gym, start meditating, read, learn new things, eat healthily.

You can do this, king.</description>

      <description>Gnome Clipboard History (GCH) is a Gnome extension that saves what you’ve copied into an easily accessible, searchable history panel. The primary innovation over existing clipboard managers is the use of a compacting log for persistent storage.</description>

      <title>Eventually consistency and cache</title>
      <link>https://olvrng.github.io/w/2022.02.22.eventually.consistency/</link>
      <description>What is it? Eventually consistency is a fancy name of doing something and only expecting the changed state after a while. And there is a guarantee that you will eventually get the expected state. Hence, consistency.
But that won’t work well with caching. And I had to deal with that recently when working with WhatsApp API.
When querying for a list of message templates from WhatsApp, we’ll cache the response for use later.</description>

      <title>Moving the kernel to modern C</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/885941/01fdc39df2ecc25f/</link>
      <description>Despite its generally fast-moving nature, the kernel project relies on a
number of old tools.  While critics like to focus on the community&amp;#39;s
extensive use of email, a possibly more significant anachronism is the use
of the 1989 version of the C language standard for kernel code — a standard
that was codified before the kernel project even began over 30 years ago.
It is looking like that longstanding practice could be coming to an end as
soon as the 5.18 kernel, which can be expected in May of this year.</description>

      <title>C++ exceptions are becoming more and more problematic</title>
      <link>http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p2544r0.html</link>
      <description>Many projects avoid or even actively disable C++ exceptions due to a number of reasons (see [P0709R4] for a detailed discussion).
The unfortunate reality is that, while exceptions are the default error reporting mechanism in C++, there are good reasons for avoiding them.
In fact the current trend to high core counts makes exceptions unsustainable, at least in their current implementation.
In the following, we first illustrate and quantify the problem, and then discuss potential mitigations.
The source code for all experiments is available at [ep].</description>
