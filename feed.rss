      <title>| Avoiding Conflicts on Social Media Might Make Things WorseMichele Coscia</title>
      <link>https://www.michelecoscia.com/?p=2082</link>
      <description>Look, I get it. Sometimes you really don’t want to get mired in a Facebook discussion with that uncle of yours who thinks that the moon doesn’t exist. It’s easier to block, unfriend, ignore, rather than engage. However, have you considered that avoiding conflicts might make things worse? This is a question Luca Rossi and I asked ourselves as a part of our research on polarization on social media. Part of the answer comes from an Agent Based Model (ABM) we have recently published on Plos One in the paper “How Minimizing Conflicts Could Lead to Polarization on Social Media: an Agent-Based Model Investigation.”</description>

      <title>In defense of NIR</title>
      <link>https://www.jlekstrand.net/jason/blog/2022/01/in-defense-of-nir/</link>
      <description>NIR has been an integral part of the Mesa driver stack for about six or seven years now (depending on how you count) and a lot has changed since NIR first landed at the end of 2014 and I wrote my initial NIR notes. Also, for various reasons, I’ve had to give my NIR elevator pitch a few times lately. I think it’s time for a new post. This time on why, after working on this mess for seven years, I still think NIR was the right call.</description>

      <title>Teleporting thru Information Space</title>
      <link>http://evanlh.com/posts/personal_information_environment/</link>
      <description>I’m really excited by the research effort proposed in Towards a Dynamic Multiscale Personal Information Space, a 2020 paper advocating more ‘convivial’1 information spaces. As the authors describe it, when a user interacts with the computer:
 The system offers a novel interface to her digital information, consolidating her data (e.g., email, messages, calendars, web pages, notes, sketches, and analyses and visualizations) across applications. When she interacts with the information in her workspace, it seems to be alive, aware of when and how it was last used, and sometimes even why she was using it.</description>

      <title>Fun with Node experimental modules and loaders</title>
      <link>https://raphael.medaer.me/2022/01/28/fun-with-node-experimental-modules-and-loaders.html</link>
      <description>If you are a front-end or a fullstack developer, you maybe already imported CSS files from a Javascript or a Typescript file. For instance: import styles from &amp;quot;./styles.css&amp;quot; A few months ago it would not have been possible out of the shelf. Indeed you would need a bundler (such as WebPack, Rollup,…) to “inline” the CSS file as a string in your Javascript file. Nowadays it’s possible thanks to the “CSS Modules” (to not confuse with the homonym open-source project).</description>

      <title>Reclaiming the lost art of Linux server administration</title>
      <link>https://www.pietrorea.com/2022/01/28/reclaiming-the-lost-art-of-linux-server-administration/</link>
      <description>One of the skills I wish I&amp;#39;d learned earlier in my career is basic Linux server administration. Specifically in relation to hosting something on the web, either a web app or API that I wrote myself, or something from the thriving self-hosted community, such as Wordpress. Managing servers is increasingly seen as the &amp;#39;older way&amp;#39; of doing things, so it&amp;#39;s easy to become a software developer and never learn to set up a VPS, set up remote access, stand up a firewall, etc.</description>

      <description>Starting Monday January 31st, Azure DevOps will no longer accept connections coming over TLS 1.0 and 1.1 due to security vulnerabilities in those protocols. Developers have increasingly become the target of hackers and these protocols have known security vulnerabilities not specific to Microsoft’s implementation.</description>
