      <description>Every time I am trying to find a programming or game development stream to watch (which is a very specific type of stream) I get lost in all the growing plants and raising chickens 24/7 streams. While on the other hand there are a lot of programming and or game development streams that really deserve their own category. Being a part of the live-coders community I feel that splitting science &amp; technology in a more granular way would benefit everybody. Both in terms of search-ability and clarity.</description>

      <link>https://www.jefftk.com/p/shared-cache-is-going-away</link>
      <description>Browsers historically have had a single HTTP Cache. This meant that if  www.a.example and www.b.example both used cdn.example/jquery-1.2.1.js then JQuery would only be downloaded once. Since it's the same resource regardless of which site initiates the download, a single shared cache is more efficient. [1]  Unfortunately, a shared cache enables a privacy leak.

      <title>Jonathan Bergknoff: Terraform Pain Points</title>
      <link>https://jonathan.bergknoff.com/journal/terraform-pain-points/</link>
      <description>I love using Terraform. At my previous job, we managed our infrastructure entirely with Terraform: tens of thousands of resources spread across several cloud providers. The benefits of infrastructure-as-code and Terraform, in particular, are massive, but well known. While I still consider Terraform the best tool of its kind, this article describes some pain points that my team and I encountered as power users. I hope it can lead to some discussion about ways to improve.</description>

      <description>XAML Islands was our first solution to enable developers to use UWP XAML inside their desktop (Win32) apps.

      <title>Working with SQLite and WebAssembly for .NET Developers - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/working-with-sqlite-and-webassembly-for-net-developers/</link>
      <description>With recent updates of the mono runtime, and the reactivity of the .NET team to fix issues, it’s now possible to use SQLite with the Uno WebAssembly Bootstrapper and Uno Platform apps.This support is now enabled through WebAssembly static linking, and the reuse of LLVM bitcode compiled source, such as SkiaSharp or SQLite. It allows for an easy use of code written in other languages, from an app built with C#. With the Erik Sink’s recent updates to SQLitePCLRaw 2.0, it’s now possible with .NET for WebAssembly to use the existing official packages. This also enables Entity Framework Core 3.1, and Frank Krueger’s SQLite-net to work out of the box without any specific configuration for WebAssembly. About Uno Platform For those new to Uno Platform – it enables for creation of single-source C# and XAML apps which run natively on iOS and Android, macOS and Web via WebAssembly. Uno Platform is Open Source (Apache 2.0) and available on GitHub. To learn more about Uno Platform, see how it works, or create a small sample app.   Client-side SQLite and Entity Framework Core In order to demonstrate the use of client-side only technologies in the browser, we’ve updated our SQLite 3.3 + EFCore 3.1 …</description>

      <title>Debounce Explained – How to Make Your JavaScript Wait For Your User To Finish Typing</title>
      <link>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/debounce-explained-how-to-make-your-javascript-wait-for-your-user-to-finish-typing-2/</link>
      <description>Debounce functions in JavaScript are higher-order functions that limit the rate
at which another function gets called.

&gt; A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an
argument or returns a function as part of its return statement. Our debounce
function does both.
The most common use case for a debounce is to pass it as an argument to an event
listener attached to an HTML element. To get a better understanding of what this
looks like, and why it is useful, let’s look a</description>
