      <description>I use Home Assistant to automate my home. This mostly involves turning lights and music on and off but I really like the idea of the dashboard being a sort of hub for my abode.</description>

      <title>Vibe coding is metaprogramming - foobuzz</title>
      <link>https://blog.valentin.sh/vibe-metacoding/</link>
      <description>I originally wanted to write 2 distinct articles, but realized that they shared the same underlying idea: "Vibe coding", the act of talking to an LLM / LLM-based AI agent to code a full project without writing a line of code manually, is no more than a metaprogramming technique, where a program (the AI agent), produces another program (the code that gets committed). As such, it shares some common characteristics of metaprogramming, notably: 1) The use-case of using metaprogramming when lacking an abstraction. 2) The poor experience of maintaining metaprogramming output when you can't maintain the generator level.</description>

      <description>So! Suppose you‚Äôre an intrepid engineer in a nascent Developer Productivity
team. Your engineering organization has decided that it wants to
move towards a monorepo. You‚Äôve heard the stories
told of Google, Meta, Uber - each a large technology company with
developer productivity organizations consisting of hundreds of engineers -
and you want to capture some of their magic in a bottle and give it to your
users. You wonder - what work lies ahead of you?</description>

      <title>Different Communication Styles in Software Engineering - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=aPJRTB8vMYQ</link>
      <description>Unfortunately, the loudest voices in the room are the ones that get heard. And it's not just because they're loud -- it's because we too often don't consider other communication styles for software engineers.

Let's see how we can make some small adjustments to accommodate others!

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.
