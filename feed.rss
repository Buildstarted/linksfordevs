      <title>You’re Doing Rate Limiting Wrong in .NET</title>

(Rate Limiting Minimal APIs and Controllers the Right Way)

Most tutorials show you how to apply global rate limits — but that’s rarely what you want in a real-world app. In this video, I’ll show you how to rate limit individual users using RateLimitPartition in .NET 8.

We’ll cover:
✅ Applying rate limits in minimal APIs and controllers
✅ Using JWT claims to identify users
✅ Fixed window vs token bucket algorithms
✅ Customizing rejected responses (e.g. Retry-After header, problem details)
✅ Using dotnet user-jwts for local testing

Whether you're building APIs for internal use or public consumption, this gives you much more control and flexibility.

      <title>Flipper Zero DarkWeb Firmware Bypasses Rolling Code Security</title>
      <link>https://www.rtl-sdr.com/flipperzero-darkweb-firmware-bypasses-rolling-code-security/</link>
      <description>Over on YouTube Talking Sasquach has recently tested custom firmware for the Flipper Zero that can entirely break the rolling code security system used on most modern vehicles. Rolling code security works by using a synchronized algorithm between a transmitter and receiver to generate a new, unique code for each transmission, preventing replay attacks and unauthorized access. In the past we've discussed an attack against rolling code security systems called RollJam, which works by jamming the original keyfob signal so the vehicle cannot receive it, and at the same time recording it for later use. However, this attack is difficult to</description>

      <title>.NET AI Community Standup - ⚡Blazing-Fast AI Inference on a Budget</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ptdNWGj8CN8</link>
      <description>What if you could process over 20,000 sentences per second without breaking the bank?

In this session, we’ll explore how to take AI workloads traditionally built in Python and turbocharge them using .NET. We’ll cover the journey from Hugging Face models and leveraging ONNX Runtime, to the latest .NET 9 &amp; 10 APIs, and the design of a flexible, high-performance AI library with no hard dependency on any single inference engine or hardware.

Expect real demos, GPU utilization comparisons, and practical tips for moving from ML research to production-ready AI—while keeping costs low and performance high.

      <title>Lessons learned by building my own cookiecutter for REST APIs</title>
      <link>https://blog.mano.lol/posts/api_cookiecutter/</link>
      <description>During my university days, I avoided building CRUD apps, not because I couldn’t, but because they felt boring. To me, it was just a client (web or mobile) talking to a server that ran some SQL queries. I dodged them in every project I could. Fast forward a three years, after graduating and working at Oracle, I’ve realized that almost everything in software is just a fancy CRUD app. And you know what?</description>

      <title>My Journey from macOS to Arch Linux with Omarchy</title>
      <link>https://www.ssp.sh/blog/macbook-to-arch-linux-omarchy/</link>
      <description>After 15 years on macOS, I made the leap to Arch Linux using Omarchy. Here's what I discovered about the trade-offs, workflow changes, and why shorter battery life and fan noise haven't sent me back to my MacBook.</description>

      <title>When every meeting looks the same</title>
      <link>https://www.ndra.dev/2025/08/06/when-every-meeting-looks-the-same.html</link>
      <description>My calendar is full of meetings and for various reasons, I find it difficult to skip them. Some of those meetings help me build context (or keep it up to date) around an area that I care about. Others are there to build and maintain relationships. As a remote worker, I no longer have a space to talk to peers on the way to lunch or while grabbing coffee, so 1:1s fill that purpose too. With the amount of meetings in my calendar, I don’t have clarity about which meetings actually need my real-time presence. This is particularly troublesome when there are conflicts and I need to pick 1 of 2 (or sometimes 3) meetings to attend. I need a system to decide: Is this important? Do I need to be there in real time? Can I just read the notes afterward? Every meeting invite looks the same in my calendar. A 30-minute block with a vague title and a list of attendees. No indication of whether I’m there to make decisions, provide context, or just stay informed. This forces me to make attendance decisions with incomplete information. I end up in meetings where I contribute nothing, while missing others where my input was actually needed. I’ve been thinking about this for a few months now and finally wrote down some notes on what I would like to see in every calendar entry. I came up with a template and the first iteration is this: # Daniel's Experimental Meeting Template ## Meeting Notes *Specify the location of the meeting notes. It may be an attached document, a wiki page, a tab in a document or a shared folder.* ## Attendees *Who will find value from attending this meeting? It could be a project manager, designer, stakeholders for a project, your team or engineers working on a specific platform.* ## Pre-work *What should attendees prepare before the meeting? Should they come with a list of questions? Or read a document?* ## Type of Meeting *What is the primary purpose for this meeting? This helps set expectations for participants.* - [ ] Fact-finding - Gathering information, understanding current state, identifying unknowns - [ ] Decision-making - Making choices with clear authority and accountability - [ ] Consensus-building - Aligning on approach through discussion and agreement - [ ] Context sharing - Providing updates, knowledge transfer, or background information - [ ] Status update - Reporting progress, blockers, and next steps - [ ] Dry run - Practice or preparation for upcoming meeting or presentation - [ ] 1:1 - One-on-one discussion (career development, feedback, relationship building) - [ ] Other: ________________ ## Agenda *Create a time-boxed agenda to keep the meeting focused. If the meeting is at risk of going over the allotted time, schedule a separate meeting or resolve the remaining issues offline.* Example: - 2-5 minutes: Review action items from the previous meeting - 5-15 minutes: Discussion on [main topic] - 5 minutes: Pulse check on [specific area - project health, blockers, team sentiment] ## Purpose *Write one to three sentences describing what this meeting is intended to accomplish. Include what is NOT in scope to prevent scope creep.* Example: The meeting is intended to discuss the development status and challenges of [project]. This is not a meeting to explore or make decisions on other projects. ## Exit Criteria *When should this recurring meeting end or evolve?* Example: This meeting will stop once Project ABC is either shipped or rolled back. ## Related Meetings *List other meetings where this topic might come up. This may be a platform sync, team meeting, or org-wide meeting.*</description>
