      <title>Complexity Explained</title>
      <link>https://complexityexplained.github.io/</link>
      <description>Complexity science, also called complex systems science, studies how a large collection of components – locally interacting with each other at small scales – can spontaneously self-organize to exhibit non-trivial global structures and behaviors at larger scales, often without external intervention, central authorities or leaders. The properties of the collection may not be understood or predicted from the full knowledge of its constituents alone. Such a collection is called a complex system and it requires new mathematical frameworks and scientific methodologies for its investigation.</description>

      <title>In the future, even your RAM will have firmware; and the subject of POWER10 blobs</title>
      <link>https://www.devever.net/~hl/omi</link>
      <description>Industry trends: serial memory attachment. One of the most interesting
things which will happen in the near future in computing is the adoption of
serial memory interfaces. For pretty much the entire history of modern
computing, RAM has been attached to a system via a high-speed parallel
interface. Making parallel interfaces fast is hard and requires extremely
rigorous control of timing skew between pins, therefore the routing of PCB
traces between a CPU and RAM slots must be done with great precision. At the
speeds of modern parallel RAM interfaces like DDR4, what is theoretically a
digital interface in practice must be viewed as practically analog (to the
point that part of a CPU DDR4 controller is called the “PHY”). Moreover, the
maximum distance between a CPU and its RAM slots is extremely tight. The
positioning of RAM slots on a motherboard is largely constrained by these
physics considerations. For these reasons you have never seen anything like the
flexibility with RAM attachment that you can get with, for example, PCIe or
SAS. PCIe and SAS are serial architectures which support cabling and even
switching, allowing entire additional chassis of PCIe and SAS devices to be
attached to a system via cables.</description>

      <title>On the Missed Opportunities of Static Types</title>
      <link>http://sigusr2.net/on-the-missed-opportunities-of-static-types.html</link>
      <description>Recently, a colleague spent a bunch of time working on a bug. When
attempting to perform some action, the system would provide feedback
that everything was going as planned, and then &amp;quot;go dark,&amp;quot; seemingly
out of no where. It&amp;#39;s important to realize that this is a complex
distributed system, and that there is a network connection between the
&amp;quot;part that worked&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the part that went dark.&amp;quot; But, there wasn&amp;#39;t a
change to the connection logic, and it worked before, so that
&amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be it.&amp;quot; (Yes. I already told you where this is going—Ed)</description>

      <title>My Staff Software Engineering Reading List</title>
      <link>https://huth.me/blog/my-staff-software-engineering-reading-list/</link>
      <description>After reading Four books professional developers should read, by Phil Eaton, I was inspired to write my own engineering reading list.
Originally I thought of this as a “staff engineering” reading list, because I probably wouldn’t have appreciated these earlier in my career. When starting out, my reading was mostly about the specifics of using Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. Which was great, and worked well for me.
But while the books in this list have been useful for me as an engineering leader, anybody at any level can get a lot out of them.</description>

      <description>On the 4th February 2021 23andMe and VG Acquisition Corp announced that they will merge, bringing 23andMe into the public.
As VGAC is already tradable in the public market, the shares have skyrocketed to 19 USD. But this is crazy&amp;amp;hellip;
Why this is crazy? First you should know that the initiators of a SPAC commonly have additional rights to e.g. buy additional shares. They also mostly pay 10 USD per share.</description>

      <title>Making Vaccine - LessWrong</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/niQ3heWwF6SydhS7R/making-vaccine</link>
      <description>Back in December, I asked how hard it would be to make a vaccine for oneself.
Several people pointed to radvac. It was a best-case scenario: an open-source
vaccine design, made for self-experimenters, dead simple to make with
readily-available materials, well-explained reasoning about the design, and with
the name of one of the world’s more competent biologists (who I already knew of
beforehand) stamped on the whitepaper. My girlfriend and I made a batch a week
ago and took our first booster yesterday.

This post talks a bit about the process, a bit about our plan, and a bit about
motivations. Bear in mind that we may have made mistakes - if something seems
off, leave a comment.

THE PROCESS
All of the materials and equipment to make the vaccine cost us about $1000. We
did not need any special licenses or anything like that. I do have a little
wetlab experience from my undergrad days, but the skills required were pretty
minimal.

One vial of custom peptide - that little pile of white powder at the bottom.The
large majority of the cost (about $850) was the peptides. These are the main
active ingredients of the vaccine: short segments of proteins from the COVID
virus. They’re all &amp;lt;25 amino acids, so far too small to have any likely function
as proteins (for comparison, COVID’s spike protein has 1273 amino acids).
They’re just meant to be recognized by the immune system: the immune system
learns to recognize these sequences, and that’s what provides immunity.

Each of six peptides came in two vials of 4.5 mg each. These are the half we
haven&amp;#39;t dissolved; we keep them in the freezer as backups.The peptides were
custom synthesized. There are companies which synthesize any (short) peptide
sequence you want - you can find dozens of them online. The cheapest options
suffice for the vaccine - the peptides don’t need to be “purified” (this just
means removing partial sequences), they don’t need any special modifications,
and very small amounts suffice. The minimum order size </description>
