      <title>Waymo Via – Waymo</title>
      <link>https://waymo.com/waymo-via/</link>
      <description>Since 2017, the Waymo Driver has been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in much the same way a human driver would, after years of driving passenger cars. Many of the principles are the same, but things like braking, turning, and checking for blind spots are quite different with a fully-loaded truck and trailer.  We’re currently testing our fleet of trucks in California and Arizona, and we’ll soon expand to Texas and New Mexico in the near future.</description>

      <title>Structured concurrency - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_concurrency</link>
      <description>Structured concurrency is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by using a structured approach to concurrent programming. The core concept is the encapsulation of concurrent threads of execution (here encompassing kernel and userland threads and processes) by way of control flow constructs that have clear entry and exit points and that ensure all spawned threads have completed before exit.  The concept is analogous to structured programming, which introduced control flow constructs that encapsulated sequential statements and subroutines.  Such encapsulation allows errors in concurrent threads to be propagated to the control structure's parent scope and managed by the native error handling mechanisms of each particular computer language.  It allows control flow to remain readily evident by the structure of the source code despite the presence of concurrency. To be effective, this model must be applied consistently throughout all levels of the program-- otherwise concurrent threads may leak out, become orphaned, or fail to have runtime errors correctly propagated.</description>

      <title>“Let’s use Kubernetes!” Now you have 8 problems</title>
      <link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/dont-need-kubernetes/</link>
      <description>If you’re using Docker, the next natural step seems to be Kubernetes, aka K8s: that’s how you run things in production, right? Well, maybe. Solutions designed for 500 software engineers working on the same application are quite different than solutions for 50 software engineers. And both will be different from solutions designed for a team of 5. If you’re part of a small team, Kubernetes probably isn’t for you: it’s a lot of pain with very little benefits. Let’s see why.</description>

      <title>How Explaining Copyright Broke the YouTube Copyright System</title>
      <link>https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/news/2020-03-04-youtube-takedown</link>
      <description>This is a story about how the most sophisticated copyright filter in the world prevented us from explaining copyright law. It doesn’t involve TikTok dance moves or nuanced 90s remixes featuring AOC. No, it involves a debate at a law school conference over how and when one song can infringe the copyright of another and how exactly one proves in a courtroom if the accused song is “substantially similar” enough to be deemed illegal.</description>

F# is both based on academic research and acts as an inspiration for thousands of

      <title>Tip 253 - Use Ingress Controller to access resources in an Azure Virtual Network</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip253.html</link>
      <description>In a recent customer engagement, they wanted to access all the AKS services via an Azure virtual network. This customer's application is not an external facing and needs to be on a corporate network to access their resources (e.g. HR, payroll,procurement etc..) If you are familiar with the Kubernetes eco system, we can use NGINX ingress controller to expose Kubernetes services on an external IP address. Azure Kubernetes Services comes to the rescue. AKS provides an option to deploy your NGINX ingress controller on an internal network which keeps the resources accessible only on an internal network and can be accessible via Express Route or VPN.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/the-spring-2020-roadmap-for-visual-studio-published/</link>
      <description>The Visual Studio roadmap has been updated to provide a peek into the work planned for Visual Studio through June 2020. It captures significant capabilities that we plan to add, but it’s not a comprehensive feature list. Our goal is to clarify what’s coming so you can plan for upgrades and provide feedback on which features would make Visual Studio a more productive development environment for you and your team.</description>
