      <title>Scarcity and Precarity in Small Manufacturing - Monome - lines</title>
      <link>https://llllllll.co/t/scarcity-and-precarity-in-small-manufacturing/55896</link>
      <description>Not normal is now normalized: the last few years have been unpredictable at best. It feels time to share some experiences and observations of the state and future of small manufacturing.  Most people experience supply chain issues as simply not being able to purchase something, or only being able to do so at a greatly inflated markup. But another situation emerged that is even more frustrating: the potentially great difficulty of repairing existing things as a result of replacement parts either ...</description>

      <title>Providence: Failure Is Always An Option</title>
      <link>https://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2015/02/12/providence-failure-is-always-an-option/</link>
      <description>This post is part of a series on the Providence project at Stack Exchange. The first post can be found here.
The last five blog posts have been a highlight reel of Providence’s successes. Don’t be fooled, though, the road to Providence was long and winding. Let’s balance out the highlight reel with a look at some of the bumps in the road.
I said the road was long. Let’s quantify that.</description>

      <description>When you are about to migrate a site from CMS 11 to CMS 12, it&amp;#39;s not unusual to want to do some rewriting and re-implementation to clean up the architecture as part of the project. When you do that (and in many other cases) it can be incredibly helpful to have a handy overview of your content, it&amp;#39;s usage and your visitor groups and their usage. Here is an easy way to get that.</description>

      <title>Zero-Day Exploitation of Atlassian Confluence | Volexity</title>
      <link>https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/</link>
      <description>Note: There is currently no available patch or fix for the issue described in this blog post. Volexity strongly recommends that all organizations block external access to their Confluence Server instances immediately until an update is provided by Atlassian. Over the Memorial Day weekend in the United States, Volexity conducted an incident response investigation involving two Internet-facing web servers belonging to one of its customers that were running Atlassian Confluence Server software. The investigation began after suspicious activity was detected on the hosts, which included JSP webshells being written to disk. Volexity immediately used Volexity Surge Collect Pro to collect system memory and key files from the Confluence Server systems for analysis. After a thorough review of the collected data, Volexity was able to determine the server compromise stemmed from an attacker launching an exploit to achieve remote code execution. Volexity was subsequently able to recreate that exploit and identify […]</description>
