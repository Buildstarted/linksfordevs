      <title>An Intuitive Explanation of Sparse Autoencoders for LLM Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://adamkarvonen.github.io/machine_learning/2024/06/11/sae-intuitions.html</link>
      <description>Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become popular for interpretability of machine learning models (although SAEs have been around since 1997). Machine learning models and LLMs are becoming more powerful and useful, but they are still black boxes, and we don’t understand how they do the things that they are capable of. It seems like it would be useful if we could understand how they work.</description>

      <title>Profiling with Ctrl-C</title>
      <link>https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-with-ctrl-c.html</link>
      <description>I once wrote about how profiler
output can be misleading. Someone commented
that you don’t need profilers - just Ctrl-C your program in a debugger instead, and you’ll see the call stack where your program
probably spends most of its time. I admit that I sneered at the idea at the time, because, despite those comments’ almost
aggressive enthusiasm, this method doesn’t actually work on the hard problems. But as my outlook on life worsened with age, I
came to think that Ctrl-C profiling deserves a shout-out, because it’s very effective against stupid problems encountered by
lazy people operating in unfriendly environments.</description>
