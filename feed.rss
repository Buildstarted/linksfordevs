      <title>392: The One Billion Row Challenge - .NET Edition</title>
      <link>https://www.mergeconflict.fm/392</link>
      <description>How fast can you read in and parse a file with one billion rows of data? That is the challenge taking over the Java world, so Frank naturally attempts to do it in F# and .NET! Let&amp;#39;s see how he did!</description>

&amp;gt; &amp;quot;You might find that Libreoffice is actually better at reading old Word files than Word.&amp;quot;

Yep. Word can&amp;#39;t read files prior to 1994.I finally got my links to my writing ironed out and content backed up into the cloud (what a pain), though it is in Time Machine, so I installed the newest Mac version of #LibreOffice.

I opened a 1992 file. Check.
I opened a 1989 file. Well, all the lowercase &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;s are converted to circumflex characters, but I can work with that.

I figured out (finally) how to search for dates on my Mac and found a story treatment named &amp;quot;The Revenger&amp;quot; (no extension, Mac naturally!). *The date is Mar 25, 1986.*

It opened with a few box characters, but otherwise readable. It looks like my attempt at an Andre Norton type SF space opera. It even opened &amp;quot;Tree Castle&amp;quot;, which is or probably was a Mac Draw document. It was dated Jan 1, 1986. It&amp;#39;s my oldest document. I&amp;#39;ve a screen cap below of the mentioned documents open in LibreOffice.

Yeah, for document conversion, LibreOffice rocks. The content of some of these old documents is amateurish; weird since I was already published. 

Still...  No lost IP. This is a good thing.

      <title>The One Billion Row Challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/?ref=upstract.com</link>
      <description>
Update Jan 4: Wow, this thing really took off!
1BRC is discussed at a couple of places on the internet, including Hacker News, lobste.rs, and Reddit.


For folks to show-case non-Java solutions, there is a &amp;quot;Show &amp;amp; Tell&amp;quot; now, check that one out for 1BRC implementations in Rust, Go, C++, and others.
Some interesting related write-ups include 1BRC in SQL with DuckDB by Robin Moffatt and 1 billion rows challenge in PostgreSQL and ClickHouse by Francesco Tisiot.


Thanks a lot for all the submissions, this is going way beyond what I’d have expected!
I am behind a bit with evalutions due to the sheer amount of entries, I will work through them bit by bit.
I have also made a few clarifications to the rules of the challenge; please make sure to read them before submitting any entries.


Let’s kick off 2024 true coder style—​I’m excited to announce the One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC), running from Jan 1 until Jan 31.


Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is deceptively simple:
write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station.
There’s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows!

      <title>Attacks on machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2024/01/07/attacking-neural-networks.html</link>
      <description>With all the hype surrounding machine learning whether its with self driving cars or LLMs, there is a big elephant in the room which not a lot of people are talking about. Its not the danger of ChatGPT taking your jobs or deepfakes or the singularity. Its instead about how neural networks can be attacked. This blog post is my attempt to throw some light on the topic. By the end of the post, you would have understood that neural network attacks are not just limited to adversarial examples and that they are just as susceptible to attacks like other systems. If you are deploying machine learning systems in production, I think its worth paying attention to this topic.</description>

      <title>TIOBE Index - TIOBE</title>
      <link>https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/</link>
      <description>For the first time in the history of the TIOBE index, C# has won the programming language of the year award. Congratulations! C# has been a top 10 player for more than 2 decades and now that it is catching up with the big 4 languages, it won the well-deserved award by being the language with the biggest uptick in one year (+1.43%). Runners up are Scratch (+0.83%) and Fortran (+0.64%). C# is eating market share from Java and is getting more and more popular in domains such as web application back ends and games (thanks to Unity). C# can be used free of charge and evolves in a steady pace, making the language more expressive every new release. C# is here to stay and might even surpass Java soon.</description>
