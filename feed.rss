Meet Jeffrey Snover, the Microsoft architect behind PowerShell, a command tool that transformed Windows system administration. Initially met with skepticism, Snover&amp;#39;s idea faced resistance from a company that favored graphical interfaces.

      <description>Suppose we have a large collection of documents, and we wish you identify which documents are approximately the same as each other. For instance, we may have crawled the web over some period of time, and expect to have fetched the “same page” several times, but to see slight differences in metadata, or that we have several revisions of a page following small edits.</description>

      <title>You&amp;#39;re Not Sick of Programming</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2024/06/27/youre-not-sick-of-programming/</link>
      <description>
Time and again, I encounter posts, people, who believe that they are sick of programming and can&amp;#39;t wait to retire to do something worthwhile (farming, traveling, for eg). Maybe they are and programming was just an ill-suited career, but higher chance that they&amp;#39;re not actually sick of programming, but fed up with:

- Bureaucratical bullshit to get simple things done
- Lack of product vision where everyone from sales to marketing to support is driving it. 
- Lack of ownership in product; the inability to effect a positive change. 
- Pointless meetings and discussions. 
- Process, procedures, having the upper-hand, and getting things done taking a back-seat.

Or maybe, they just need a break and do something different. Even renowned artists, writers hit a block and must work hard to replenish their motivation.

Speaking from personal experience, the burnout stage can skew our perspective unfavorably. It can make us overlook programming&amp;#39;s immense potential for creative fulfillment and underestimate hurdles in other pursuits. Farming, for instance, while enjoyable for a few weeks, can be incredibly taxing (both mentally and physically) in the long run.  Perhaps, it would serve anyone better to fix why they&amp;#39;re failing to realize the creative potential of programming vs. throwing it all away.

      <title>Beating NumPy’s matrix multiplication in 150 lines of C code</title>
      <link>https://salykova.github.io/matmul-cpu</link>
      <description>TL;DR The code from the tutorial is available at matmul.c. This blog post is the result of my attempt to implement high-performance matrix multiplication on CPU while keeping the code simple, portable and scalable. The implementation follows the BLIS design, works for arbitrary matrix sizes, and, when fine-tuned for an AMD Ryzen 7700 (8 cores), outperforms NumPy (=OpenBLAS), achieving over 1 TFLOPS of peak performance across a wide range of matrix sizes.</description>
