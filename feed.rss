      <description>The Federal Court has found that Google LLC and Google Australia Pty Ltd (together, Google) misled consumers about personal location data collected through Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018, in a world-first enforcement action brought by the ACCC. “This is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the Court’s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</description>

      <title>Why Rust strings seem hard</title>
      <link>https://www.brandons.me/blog/why-rust-strings-seem-hard</link>
      <description>Lately I&amp;#39;ve been seeing lots of anecdotes from people trying to get into Rust
who get really hung up on strings (&amp;amp;str, String, and their relationship).
Beyond Rust&amp;#39;s usual challenges around ownership, there can be an added layer of
frustration because strings are so easy in the great majority of languages.
You just add them together, split them, whatever! They&amp;#39;re primitives that you
can do whatever you want with. For someone who&amp;#39;s only ever known this mental
model (which is to say, never worked much with C/C++), using strings in Rust
can be a rude awakening. They feel very complicated, have all these
restrictions and extra steps, and it all just seems so unnecessary.</description>

      <title>WebView2: Forwarding Alt Keys to a Host WPF Window</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Apr/15/WebView2-Forwarding-Alt-Keys-to-a-Host-WPF-Window</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been puzzling over how to reliably integrate keyboard forwarding from the WebView2 control into WPF host forms. Unlike the IE WebBrowser control the WebView2 doesn&amp;#39;t automatically forward Alt keys to the host form so special handling is required. In this post I describe why this is a problem and show the workaround to make this work.</description>

      <title>Why is Python popular despite being accused of being slow?</title>
      <link>https://www.sethserver.com/python/why-is-python-so-slow.html</link>
      <description>Let me reframe this question using different technology. Why are Toyota Corollas so popular despite being so slow? They&amp;#39;re obviously much slower than rocket powered aircraft! Things just got crazy, right? Let&amp;#39;s do some math to prove our point about how slow Toyota Corollas really are when compared to rockets.</description>

      <title>Top Level Statement in C# 9.0</title>
      <link>https://dailydotnettips.com/top-level-statement-in-c-9-0/</link>
      <description>C# 9.0 introduced a new feature called Top-Level Statement. Top-Level Statement allows developers to write programs without explicitly defining the class or main method. Until C# 9.0, It was all about the Main() method where program control start and ends. With C# 9.0, you don&amp;#39;t need to mention the Main() method or Class definition explicitly using Top-Level Statement. Let us take a look at how to use the Top-Level statement in C# and how it works internally.</description>
