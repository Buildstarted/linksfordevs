      <description>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements forever. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</description>

      <title>How Tail Call Optimization Works</title>
      <link>https://eklitzke.org/how-tail-call-optimization-works</link>
      <description>Most undergraduate computer sciences courses teach students about tail call
optimization (TCO), and even if you
don&amp;#39;t have a formal computer science background the concept is talked about
enough that you might be familiar with it anyway, especially if you&amp;#39;ve ever done
any functional programming. However, I think the way TCO is normally taught is
very confusing, because it&amp;#39;s normally taught in the context of recursion. It&amp;#39;s
taught this way because without TCO many recursive functions can blow up the
stack causing a stack overflow. Therefore by teaching people about TCO in the
context of recursion, you can teach them why optimizing compilers (or
interpreters) can run tail recursive code efficiently and without causing a
stack overflow.</description>

      <title>The story of the one line fix – Dave Cheney</title>
      <link>https://dave.cheney.net/2020/12/15/the-story-of-the-one-line-fix</link>
      <description>Picture yourself, an engineer working at the hottest distributed microservices de jour, assigned to fix a bug. You jump into an unfamiliar codebase and quickly locate the line where the problem occurred. The fix is simple, just return early or substitute a default value in the case that one cannot be determined from your input. Boom, problem solved. Code compiles, fix goes out to production, and the card’s in the done pile in time for Tuesday drinks at the pub.</description>

      <title>Shitlist Driven Development</title>
      <link>https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/</link>
      <description>Recently the team I work with completed a project to allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</description>

And one of the leading candidates was a concept that was known as the horizon.</description>
