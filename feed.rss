      <description>Welcome to ARK000 ‚Äî the kickoff for ARK (Acts of Random Kindness) üåü

In this stream:
0/ What is ARK?
1/ Why kindness needs its own platform
2/ How we're building it (Blazor MAUI üöÄ)
3/ How you can get involved (code, design, ideas, support)

It‚Äôs free ‚Äî as in free tea and free speech. üçµüó£Ô∏è
If you‚Äôre looking for something positive to build, you‚Äôre in the right place.

Let‚Äôs make something beautiful together.</description>

      <description>So let‚Äôs flip the script to something that actually compounds: vibe refactoring. Same spontaneous energy, but aimed at shrinking technical debt and sharpening your architecture instead of amping up the commit count.</description>

      <title>The Seven-Year Rule - MacSparky</title>
      <link>https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/04/the-seven-year-rule/</link>
      <description>Years ago, I encountered a fascinating concept in a book by the Dalai Lama: every seven years, human beings transform into entirely new versions of themselves. This idea stems from the biological principle that our bodies replace virtually all their cells over a seven-year cycle. The person you are today doesn‚Äôt share a single cell...

      <title>TPSV</title>
      <link>https://chtenb.dev/?page=tpsv</link>
      <description>Despite CSV (Comma-Separated-Values) being ubiquitous, its cousin TSV (Tab-Separated-Values) has
direct advantages over CSV in many situations. Tab characters don‚Äôt
normally occur in the data being encoded, which avoids the need for
quoting. Moreover, if your columns all have a similar width, you can
configure the tab-width in any text editor such that all columns align
nicely. Unfortunately, in many cases columns do not have a similar
width.</description>
