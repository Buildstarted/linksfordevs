      <title>SSH PKI on top of Web PKI</title>
      <link>https://paul.totterman.name/posts/ssh-pki-web-pki/</link>
      <description>Reading Future Internet PKI schemes need to be bootstrapped through web
PKI I was
reminded by all the problems I’ve had with SSH (Secure SHell) PKI (Public Key

falls prey to the attack.</description>
