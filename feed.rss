A couple of days ago at work we announced the Steam Deck OLED.  It’s available next week (Nov 16) and though it’s got a bunch of great improvements like longer battery life, faster downloads, the star is the ultra-bright HDR OLED screen. 

The screens are ridiculously bright and vibrant, so we thought it would be fun to use actual Steam Deck OLEDs as lighting sources to light our entire launch trailer. 

Of course this necessitated building a giant metal orb. First though, here’s the final spot:</description>

      <title>GPU Survival Toolkit for the AI age: The bare minimum every developer must know</title>

      <description>Why CPU Knowledge Is No Longer Enough



In today&amp;#39;s AI age, the majority of developers train in the CPU way. This knowledge has been part of our academics as well, so it&amp;#39;s obvious to think and problem-solve in a CPU-oriented way.



However, the problem with CPUs is that they rely</description>

      <title>Farewell to the felt - Quitting the full-time Poker scene</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/11/12/quitting-fulltime-poker.html</link>
      <description>I used to play Poker for a living from 2018-2021. These days whenever I recount my past with new people, everyone inevitably asks me why I stopped playing the game (full time) if it was profitable to do so. Its understandably hard to comprehend why anybody would stop pursuing a money making endeavour. So, I want to write this post to summarily answer most questions around this topic and mostly because I am tired of repeating myself again and again.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve done some work (broadly speaking) on that front but I&amp;#39;ve felt that I have plenty to learn; hence, why I&amp;#39;m looking at learning a bit more. My hope is that going through these challenges while I&amp;#39;m on sabbatical will be a good way for me to figure out what my knowledge gaps are and what I have to learn.</description>

      <title>mht.wtf</title>
      <link>https://mht.wtf/post/simplicity/</link>
      <description>I used to think that simplicity is good because of the other values it often brings:
a simple system is easier to write;
a simple system is easier to build;
a simple system is more portable;
a simple system is easier to debug and reason about;
a simple system performs well;
a simple system is easier to change.
The word “simple” does some heavy lifting here, and I found that I would often use these as a metric for if something was simple or not.
In other words, these weren’t the result of simplicity, they were the definition.</description>

      <title>The Reasoning Computer</title>
      <link>https://fabisevi.ch/2023/11/10/the-reasoning-computer/</link>
      <description>The Turing test is dead, and we killed it. The Turing test is a test of a machine&amp;#39;s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. From the 1940s  to the 2010s people programmed computers, and computers could only do what they were programmed to do in a rules-based deterministic manner. Sometimes a person would program the computer and it would do something unexpected, but 100 out of 100 times the computer was doing what it was programmed to do whether the person liked it or not. While there has been experimentation with what today we call AI since the 1950s, those machines were a long ways away from passing the Turing test. Why does using ChatGPT feel more like a conversation with the smartest person you know than a computer? It&amp;#39;s because ChatGPT doesn&amp;#39;t solve problems deterministically the way a programmed computer&amp;#160;does, it solves them probabilistically.  ChatGPT demonstrates the ability to think about something in a logical, sensible way, the definition of reasoning.  We&amp;#39;ve created something completely new here, a reasoning computer.</description>

      <description>I have always hated the phrase “Don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions!”. It feels lazy. It incentivizes people to sweep things under the rug if they can’t figure out what to do. It doesn’t give any useful direction to the person bringing you problems, because if they had solutions, they probably would have brought them already! At its best, it’s unhelpful, at its worst, it’s actively harmful.
I have similar, but less strong issues with the idea of telling someone to “take more initiative”.</description>

      <description>Wherein I describe the setup of this blog. The main take away from the post are not specific
