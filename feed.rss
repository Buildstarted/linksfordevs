a reasonable likelyhood of success.</description>

      <description>OCTO Project: Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. It builds on the “[git scraping” approach pioneered by Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) to offer a simple pattern for bringing working datasets into your repositories and versioning them, because developing against local datasets is faster and easier than working with data over the wire.</description>

      <title>Exploring ZooKeeper-less Kafka</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/exploring-zookeeper-less-kafka/</link>
      <description>
Sometimes, less is more.
One case where that’s certainly true is dependencies.
And so it shouldn’t come at a surprise that the Apache Kafka community is eagerly awaiting the removal of the dependency to the ZooKeeper service,
which currently is used for storing Kafka metadata (e.g. about topics and partitions) as well as for the purposes of leader election in the cluster.


The Kafka improvement proposal KIP-500
(&amp;quot;Replace ZooKeeper with a Self-Managed Metadata Quorum&amp;quot;)
promises to make life better for users in many regards:




Better getting started and operational experience by requiring to run only one system, Kafka, instead of two


Removing potential for discrepancies of metadata state between ZooKeeper and the Kafka controller


Simplifying configuration, for instance when it comes to security


Better scalability, e.g. in terms of number of partitions; faster execution of operations like topic creation

      <title>Using AirTags to detect stationary iPhones &amp;#183; Łukasz&amp;#39;s website!</title>
      <link>https://lukaszkrol.net/airtags_stationary/</link>
      <description>On April 30th, 2021, Apple released a new product, called the AirTags. Those small, round devices can quickly find and track lost objects such as keys or bicycles. Almost instantly after the announcement, concerns emerged that AirTags could be also be used to track people, too. Apple did, to its credit, add some anti-stalking and anti-tracking mechanisms to the AirTags. An AirTag that is travelling with someone who is not its owner is meant to alert its target thereof, either through a notification (for those who have Apple devices with iOS 14.5 or higher) or through an audible noise that they make after three days. Only a few days after the AirTag’s release, many security experts described their mechanisms as ineffective: an AirTag slipped into somebody’s coat pocket or backpack could easily have revealed their home address by the time the notification shows up or an alert rings.</description>

      <description>I love building developer tools and utilities. And, I believe the reason is simple, because I am a developer, and those tools I make, I create first of all for myself. I worked for Microsoft before on Visual Studio.
I worked in Splunk on some work related to the developers (App Platform). I can say that I had some experience building developer tools by learning from large corporations.
For the last 3-4 years, I work for myself.</description>

      <title>Fierce Nerds</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/fn.html</link>
      <description>Most people think of nerds as quiet, diffident people. In ordinary
social situations they are — as quiet and diffident as the star
quarterback would be if he found himself in the middle of a physics
symposium. And for the same reason: they are fish out of water.
But the apparent diffidence of nerds is an illusion due to the fact
that when non-nerds observe them, it&amp;#39;s usually in ordinary social
situations. In fact some nerds are quite fierce.</description>
