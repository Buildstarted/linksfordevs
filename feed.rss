      <title>Penetration Testing and Low-Cost Freelancing</title>
      <link>https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/</link>
      <description>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</description>
