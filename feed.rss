  What does the future of the show look like? Who are the next, big ticket, guests? What's a SegFault? Why does my knee hurt? Why do fools fall in love? Does this look infected to you?  Any many more. So definitely make a point of listening to this episode... all the way to the end, too.

 There's no transcription for this episode, as it's all breaking news and I didn't have the time to get one completed before the time of release.

 In this episode, I'll talk you through a slight change of direction for the show. But more on that in a moment. Let's listen to the intro music for a little longer before I wrap up this intro.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `go mod init github.com/golang-show` and we'll dive into...

      <title>Two Attacks on Naive Tree Hashes</title>
      <link>https://jacko.io/tree_hashing.html</link>
      <description>If you're building a tree hash,‚Äãalso known as a Merkle tree and you want it to have the same
security properties as a cryptographic hash like SHA-3 or BLAKE3, there are a
couple of "attacks" you need to know about. Here's a naive recursive tree hash
based on SHA-3 in Python, which turns out to be vulnerable to these
attacks:‚ÄãDividing the length by 2 at each level of the tree like this is a
shortcut, but the resulting tree structure isn't great, because we have to
know the final input length to figure out where any of the leaf or subtree
boundaries are. That's no problem in these examples, but in practice most
hash functions need to be able to "stream" long inputs in a loop
without knowing the final length until the end. A better splitting rule for
real tree hashes is to make the left side as large as possible as long as
it's a power-of-2. See the BLAKE3 paper, particularly sections 2.1 and
5.1.2, and also Binary Numeral Trees.</description>

many? I got curious about analyzing the XML, and

used pipx install yq to install yq so that I
could use the xq tool to query the XML, much like
jq works.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Dijkstra‚Äôs Note on ‚ÄúWhy Numbering Should Start at Zero‚Äù</title>
      <link>https://fabiendubosson.com/blog/unpacking-dijkstra-note-on-why-numbering-should-start-at-zero/</link>
      <description>Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote a famous note titled ‚ÄúWhy numbering should start at zero‚Äù This three-page handwritten document is often cited in discussions about why indexing in programming languages should start at zero. While his reasoning is relatively straightforward, the document lacks the structure and examples needed to fully grasp it‚Äîat least for me‚Äîwithout resorting to pen and paper. As a result, I decided to read it thoroughly and unpack his reasoning into explicit arguments, expressed in my own words and illustrated with examples.</description>

      <title>Web‚Äôs biggest problem. Introduction to Web 1.1 ‚Äì Reinventing the Web</title>
      <link>https://reinventingtheweb.com/2025/03/02/webs-biggest-problem/</link>
      <description>The World Wide Web started as a web of documents. That was back in the early ‚Äô90s. Web pages were static HTML documents‚Äîsimple, read-only pages that just presented information. There was no interactivity. Then, in 1995, JavaScript was added to browsers, changing everything.</description>

      <title>How to fix the Missing Custom Models bug</title>
      <link>https://www.lucasaguiar.xyz/posts/fix-custom-models-open-webui/</link>
      <description>This is a quick fix to a problem I experienced with Open WebUI, which was that custom models were not showing in the models list. There was nothing in the documentation or in the issues pointing to a solution. I decided to open a new issue 4 days ago and today the user @dcolley gave the missing information and it worked.
For some reason, custom models are not working when you use Direct Connections.</description>

      <title>On Binary Distribution Rebuilds ‚Äì Simon Josefsson's blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.josefsson.org/2025/03/31/on-binary-distribution-rebuilds/</link>
      <description>I rebuilt (the top-50 popcon) Debian and Ubuntu packages, on amd and arm64, and compared the results a couple of months ago. Since then the Reproduce.Debian.net effort has been launched. Unlike my small experiment, that effort is a full-scale rebuild with more architectures. Their goal is to reproduce what is published in the Debian archive.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping ranking models with an LLM judge - Emir's blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2025-03-30-bootstrap-ranking-llm-judge/</link>
      <description>I use 500 Hacker News (HN) titles and an LLM to derive an article ranking
model from a user supplied preference description. The LLM supplies the
labelled data, whilst Ridge regression and cheap sentence transformer
embedding provides the features. The surrogate has 0.74 Spearman correlation
with the LLM labels, which is remarkable given that the experiment is entirely
unoptimised.</description>
