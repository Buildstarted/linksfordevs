      <description>This text is a practical guide to writing your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help with the technical details while at the same time not reveal too much with samples and code excerpts. We‚Äôve tried to collect parts of the vast (and often excellent) expanse of material and tutorials available, on the web and otherwise, and add our own insights into the problems we encountered and struggled with.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13446</link>
      <description>This is a collection of (mostly) pen-and-paper exercises in machine learning. The exercises are on the following topics: linear algebra, optimisation, directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, expressive power of graphical models, factor graphs and message passing, inference for hidden Markov models, model-based learning (including ICA and unnormalised models), sampling and Monte-Carlo integration, and variational inference.</description>

      <title>Database Protocols Are Underwhelming</title>

      <description>If you‚Äôve been in this trade for a while, you have probably seen dozens of debates on the merits and problems of SQL as a relational database query language. As an ORM maintainer, I have a few gripes with SQL, but overall it is workable, and anyway, it has so much inertia that there‚Äôs no point fantasizing about a replacement.</description>

      <title>The Software Engineering Identity Crisis - Annie Vella</title>
      <link>https://annievella.com/posts/the-software-engineering-identity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Many of us became software engineers because we found our identity in building things. Not managing things. Not overseeing things. Building things. With our own hands, our own minds, our own code.
But that identity is being challenged.
AI coding assistants aren‚Äôt just changing how we write software - they‚Äôre fundamentally transforming who we are. We‚Äôre shifting from creators to orchestrators, from builders to overseers. From engineers to something that looks suspiciously like‚Ä¶ managers.</description>

      <description>When it comes to building scalable web applications, statelessness is one of REST‚Äôs most powerful constraints. It simplifies architecture, makes scaling easier, and helps APIs handle massive traffic loads without breaking a sweat. But what does being ‚Äústateless‚Äù actually mean in REST, and why is it such a big deal?</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding is a Dangerous Fantasy</title>
      <link>https://nmn.gl/blog/vibe-coding-fantasy</link>
      <description>Last week, X exploded when a ‚Äúvibe coder‚Äù announced his SaaS was under attack. His business, built entirely with AI assistance and ‚Äúzero hand-written code,‚Äù was experiencing bypassed subscriptions, maxed-out API keys, and database corruption. His follow-up admission made this notable: ‚Äúas you know, I‚Äôm not technical so this is taking me longer than usual to figure out.‚Äù As someone deeply immersed in the AI code generation space, I‚Äôve been watching this unfold with a mix of sympathy and frustration. Let me be clear ‚Äî I‚Äôm not against AI-assisted development. My own tool aims to improve code generation quality. But there‚Äôs a growing and dangerous fantasy that technical knowledge is optional in the new AI-powered world. After observing many similar (though less public) security disasters, I‚Äôve come to a controversial conclusion: vibe coding isn‚Äôt just inefficient ‚Äî it‚Äôs potentially catastrophic.</description>

In this practical walkthrough, I explore how AI can transform the often tedious process of writing unit tests for .NET applications. Starting with a tour of my semi-complex .NET project, I explain its real-world use cases and demonstrate some existing test implementations. The video reveals why providing AI (specifically using Cursor) with example tests dramatically improves its ability to generate high-quality unit tests that match your coding standards and patterns. Watch as I demonstrate the complete workflow - from generating unit tests for the Domain layer to troubleshooting and fixing AI-generated code errors, and finally running the successful tests in Visual Studio.

We'll then extend the approach to the Application layer, showing how this technique can be applied across different parts of your architecture. Whether you're looking to reduce testing bottlenecks or improve your coverage, this step-by-step guide shows exactly how AI can become a valuable addition to your .NET development toolkit.
