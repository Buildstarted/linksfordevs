      <title>State of the SqueakPhone—Syndicated Actors</title>
      <link>https://syndicate-lang.org/journal/2022/06/03/phone-progress</link>
      <description>One of my projects over the past couple of years has been Synit, a
Syndicate init (really, systemd and D-Bus) replacement. Synit underpins another
project, #squeak-phone, a sketch of an alternative to Android for personal computing on a
mobile device.</description>

      <title>How &amp;quot;See A Satellite Tonight&amp;quot; Works | James Darpinian</title>
      <link>https://james.darpinian.com/blog/how-see-a-satellite-tonight-works</link>
      <description>See A Satellite Tonight is my most successful side project so far, with 5 million users since launch in 2019. It&amp;#39;s been entirely a solo project, and I&amp;#39;ve used it as a proving ground for a bunch of tech that I wanted to learn. It took dozens of APIs and services to put together the experience I wanted: The front page of See A Satellite Tonight</description>

      <title>I’m tired of making decisions</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2022/07/15/decision-making-is-finite.html</link>
      <description>Decisions are our keys to the ethereal freedom, but they are also our shackles to the earth. I’ve been thinking a lot about what makes a system pleasant for me to use, particularly as a workstation. I’ve become disillusioned with a lot of Linux distributions as of late, not for technical reasons, but just because many of them feel cause me to feel depressed and dejected when I work with them. One of the primary factors I’ve identified is how they reckon with choice. What do they allow me to choose? What do they force me to choose? This balance is why I use Puppy Linux, despite everything, and why I’ve gone from being an Arch Linux zealot to avoiding it at all costs.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Ads</title>
      <link>http://peterhajas.com/blog/avoiding_ads.html</link>
      <description>I hate ads. I don&amp;#39;t like watching them, I don&amp;#39;t like seeing them, and I don&amp;#39;t like hearing them. The attention economy is very sad and I want no part of it. &amp;quot;Ethical ads&amp;quot; are about as oxymoronic as &amp;quot;healthy cigarettes&amp;quot;. A friend recently told me that advertising reduces activity in the decision-making parts of your brain.</description>

      <title>What I Wish Someone Would Have Told Me About Using Rabbitmq Before It Was Too Late</title>
      <link>https://ryanrodemoyer.github.io/what-i-wish-someone-would-have-told-me-about-using-rabbitmq-before-it-was-too-late/</link>
      <description>My watch is buzzing and in my pre-dawn stupor I cannot decipher if this is an alarm or a phone call. The time is 4:45 AM. I pull it together to realize it’s a call from a number I do not know - never a good sign. I answer and it is a coworker - my peer who runs our support team that is engaged in nearly all production issues for our customers. “Hi Ryan. Sorry to wake you, I know it’s early. Our biggest customer is reporting their requests are taking over two hours to return results. We think it’s because of our messaging system but we aren’t sure where to go from here. We need your help. Please join our call.” A few moments later my watch buzzed again as my morning alarm sounded. Today, this morning will not be for a workout.
