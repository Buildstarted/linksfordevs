      <title>An opinionated approach about how to create an AWS ECS Fargate cluster and deploy apps on it using Azure DevOps Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/create-an-ecs-cluster-and-deploy-apps-using-azure-devops/</link>
      <description>These past couple of weeks I’ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building.
My goal was trying to build an AWS ECS Fargate cluster and deploy apps on it using Azure DevOps Pipelines and I had 3 clear objectives I wanted to achieve.
 All the infrastructure in AWS must be created using IaC (infrastructure-as-code) and must be created using an Azure DevOps pipeline.</description>

For example, if you are a UWP app, you can set your app’s custom title bar colors with properties like Application&amp;#173;View&amp;#173;Title&amp;#173;Bar.Background&amp;#173;Color.
