      <title>Why Robinhood Disabled Buys but not Sells</title>
      <link>https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood&amp;#39;s actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that&amp;#39;s mainly because it&amp;#39;s a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers.</description>

      <title>Personal experiences bridge moral and political divides better than facts</title>
      <link>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/6/e2008389118</link>
      <description>All Americans are affected by rising political polarization, whether because of a gridlocked Congress or antagonistic holiday dinners. People believe that facts are essential for earning the respect of political adversaries, but our research shows that this belief is wrong. We find that sharing personal experiences about a political issue—especially experiences involving harm—help to foster respect via increased perceptions of rationality. This research provides a straightforward pathway for increasing moral understanding and decreasing political intolerance. These findings also raise questions about how science and society should understand the nature of truth in the era of “fake news.” In moral and political disagreements, everyday people treat subjective experiences as truer than objective facts.

      <title>Max Hodak - Do words mean anything?</title>
      <link>https://maxhodak.com/nonfiction/2021/01/30/do-words-mean-anything.html</link>
      <description>The principle of absolute freedom of speech has embedded in it a basic premise that words do not inherently mean anything. This wasn’t obvious to me and felt surprising, in the this-must-be-wrong way, when I noticed it. But if we agree that there exist things so bad that they should be prohibited, like murder, and simultaneously take that there is no sequence of words that are so inherently bad that they should be prohibited, then we must subscribe to a view that words-in-themselves must not, in the general case, map to anything imbued with inherent meaning.</description>
