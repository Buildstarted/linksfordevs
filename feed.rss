      <description>The idea that we must always linearize sRGB gradients or work in a perceptually
uniform colorspace is starting to be accepted universally. But is it that
simple?</description>

      <description>The assertions that Apple’s AirPods need more success are misguided. The fact that the company pushes out free software updates for existing models prove their strategic strength and commitment to user satisfaction over the long-term.</description>

      <title>A Responsibility to the Industry</title>
      <link>https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html</link>
      <description>Firstly, I maintain that it makes absolutely no sense that Alan Dye has the power he has, because he simply has no taste. But what’s worse is that he wields that power so clumsily, so carelessly. And because it goes unchallenged, unchecked by someone higher than him, the entire industry suffers the consequences.</description>

      <title>Are we scribes?</title>
      <link>https://ashouri.xyz/post/arewescribes</link>
      <description>O God! O piety! O holy venerable faith! What, my lords, are you doing? Your pledges come to nothing, as long as what is pleasant is more pleasing to you than what is honourable. They basely flood the market with anything suggestive of sexuality, and they print the stuff at such a low price that anyone and everyone procures it for himself in abundance. And so it happens that asses go to school.</description>

      <title>lsr: ls but with io_uring</title>
      <link>https://rockorager.dev/log/lsr-ls-but-with-io-uring/</link>
      <description>As an excercise in syscall golf, I wrote an implementation of ls(1) which uses my IO library, ourio to perform as much of the IO as possible. What I ended up with is something that is faster than any version or alternative to ls I tested, and also performs an order of magnitude fewer syscalls. I’m calling it lsr. Let’s start with the benchmarks, then we’ll see how we got there.</description>
