      <title>A Reflection on my B.S. in Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://headlinedev.xyz/posts/2023-09-30-a-reflection-on-my-software-engineering-degree/</link>
      <description>Earlier this year I graduated with a B.S. in Software Engineering from a University in California. Since then, I’ve been hired as a network programmer for a game company, where I primarily work on multiplayer stuff. Although I’ve had some great experiences modding games, I’ve always been skeptical of actually entering the video game industry.
I remember friends asking me in my first few years of university if I’d apply to game companies once I graduated.</description>

      <title>Guide to Timescript</title>
      <link>https://www.jacquifashimpaur.com/timescript</link>
      <description>Timescript is a decorative writing system where time (ie. movement) is a critical feature. It encodes the sounds used to say a phrase, rather than the letters used to spell it, in an infinitely looping animation that cannot be read when paused. This guide describes how to read and write in Timescript.</description>

      <link>https://ataiva.com/machine-learning-mastery-series-part-1-introduction-to-machine-learning/</link>
      <description>Welcome to the Machine Learning Mastery Series, a comprehensive journey into the exciting world of machine learning. In this first installment, we’ll lay the foundation by exploring the fundamentals of machine learning, its types, and the essential concepts that underpin this transformative field.
What is Machine Learning? Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</description>

      <title>Easing tradeoffs with profiles &amp;#183; baby steps</title>
      <link>https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2023/09/30/profiles/</link>
      <description>Rust helps you to build reliable programs. One of the ways it does that is by surfacing things to your attention that you really ought to care about. Think of the way we handle errors with Result: if some operation can fail, you can’t, ahem, fail to recognize that, because you have to account for the error case. And yet often the kinds of things you care about depend on the kind of application you are building. A classic example is memory allocation, which for many Rust apps is No Big Deal, but for others is something to be done carefully, and for still others is completely verboten. But this pattern crops up a lot. I’ve heard and like the framing of designing for “what do you have to pay attention to” – Rust currently aims for a balance that errs on the side of paying attention to more things, but tries to make them easy to manage. But this post is about a speculative idea of how we could do better than that by allowing programs to declare a profile.</description>

requests is where I spend almost all of my time while on GitHub, and to me its
also unfortunately the most frustrating part of GitHub.</description>

      <title>Beginning CMake : Quick Getting Started with CMake</title>
      <link>https://norabellm.github.io/posts/beginning-cmake/</link>
      <description>CMake is build system intented for organize C/C++ project. Not only saving me from write long compiler command to build program, it also become project definition. Cmake handle dependencies, build, compiler selection, testing and many others. If you familiar with GNU Make, this may the niche version of it that specialize to C/C++ code.
CMake works by compiling CMakeList.txt (Your project definition) into native build system such Makefile, ninja, meson or other.</description>

      <title>India Should Switch Off IPv4 Internet</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/india-should-switch-off-ipv4-internet/</link>
      <description>IPv6 migration has been dragging on for a decades now and there’s no end in sight for this migration to complete. Huge software companies like Amazon are buying even more IPv4 addresses to continue to support IPv4 users. Given the current stance of corporations and many governments it seems that Internet will forever be split into two protocols.
