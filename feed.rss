      <title>Can't you just right click?</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html</link>
      <description>In 2012, Apple added Gatekeeper to Mac OS X (now macOS). When you try to run Mac software downloaded from the internet, Gatekeeper checks whether the software was signed with a valid Developer ID certificate. If not, then Gatekeeper refuses to run the software. Over the years, Gatekeeper has become more strict, recently adding a notarization requirement. On macOS Catalina, Gatekeeper not only checks whether the software was signed by a valid Developer ID certificate, it also "phones home" to check whether Apple has notarized the software, again refusing to run it if the check fails. Mac developers must sign up for the Apple Developer Program, sign a legal agreement, and pay an annual fee of USD $99 plus tax in order to obtain a Developer ID code signing certificate and upload software to Apple for notarization.</description>

      <description>While automation tools are fundamental to modern software development, they also have the innate potential to be used for malicious purposes. This applies to Puppeteer and Playwright, too.
As a consequence, some user flows are made purposely hard to automate to defend against threat actors. Some examples:

New user signup
Social login through providers like Google, Facebook etc.
"Forgot password" and similar reset scenarios</description>
