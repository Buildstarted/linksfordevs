      <title>How to DIY home security</title>
      <link>https://vedard.com/blog/how-to-diy-home-security/</link>
      <description>How to DIY home security? It is easy to buy an IP camera and place it in the living room and remote monitor your home. But it is not enough to secure your home. To completely secure your home and prevent any intrusion, you need to know how to choose the detectors, where to install the detectors and how to set up the home security system. We will analyze the actual case of home security solution. We hope that can help you understanding home anti-theft and monitoring systems.
Step1:Determine the scope of prevention according to the home situation

From Figure 1, we can see that the 2 balconies and doors are in the most vulnerable areas. The second one is the kitchen and the study room windows (because the study room and kitchen are usually unoccupied, especially at night, they are usually vacant, which can easily become the entrance of thieves). The third is the master bedroom ①, children’s room ② and bathroom ③. So we firstly determined the areas that need to be protected. Then we need to determine the priority of the prevention area (the intrusion position is indicated by the priority of the prevention in the figure)
Step 2:Determine the defense area and the prevention method and equipment of each defense
After the location and area that are vulnerable to intrusion are determined, we need to determine the prevention method and equipment for each defense area.  It is better to have all areas protected. But if the environment situation and community security is good, you can only have the main entrance areas protected.

1)Basic home security solution
This security solution only set defense areas of gate, both balconies, kitchen, and study room. Wireless door contacts are used for protection of gate, kitchen and study room. PIR motion sensors are used for protection of living room and bed room.
When the gate or study room, kitchen room door or windows are open, or body motion detected in living room and bed room, the detector will trigger alarm panel and loud sound siren strobe goes alarm, at the same time, alarm signal will be sent to mobile phone or security service center.
The shortage: When using door contact, the windows should be closed even in summer. Bathroom and children room is not protected and with security hazard.
2)Complete home security solution

On the basis of basic home security solution, one added infrared detector is installed in children’s room, living room and study room, and one door magnetic detector is installed in the window of the bathroom. In this way, we have completed a basic family anti-theft system, and at the same time, double detection equipment is installed in the key defense area (gate and study room)
When the gate or the study room, kitchen, bathroom window is opened, or have human body movement detected in balcony, children room, study room, the alarm will go off. At the same time, double defend of different types sensors installed in gate and study room to ensure the defense of the main entrance.
The shortage: although all the indoor scope has been in the protection, but the passive infrared detector can only active after the invasion. The perimeter protection of the balcony and the window is not very effective with door contact.
3)Improved home security solution

In order to solve the problem that the balcony and windows intruders can not be prevented at first time. We installed infrared barriers on the balcony and windows, and remove some indoor infrared detectors.
So, the infrared barriers outside the balcony and windows can promptly alarm when someone approaches the balcony and the window. Keep the intruder outside, prevent the intruder from entering the room. The improved home security solution can better protect the personal and property safety.
Shortages:&amp;#160;No video monitoring function and linkage equipment, and unable to use technical means to retain evidence while alarming

Step3: Optional equipment to enhance the prevention function
Based on the above setting, we can choose smart detectors or microwave detectors to replace the above ordinary infrared detectors; add harmful gas detectors in the kitchen, Add linkage lighting control equipment in the living room (when someone approaches the window, the lights in the living room will automatically turn on when the alarm is issued); the door is equipped with a digital anti-theft lock; the glass is equipped with a vibration detector to further enhance the prevention ability.&amp;#160;One thing to note is that, while focusing on new technologies and new products, security products should also focus on stable and mature conventional and reliable ability.</description>

      <title>Home Assistant compatible desk fan (120mm) – Tristam</title>
      <link>https://tristam.ie/2023/663/</link>
      <description>Frustrated by the lack of fans that integrate with Home Assistant, I decided to modify this 120mm fan stand  to include a compartment for a Wemos D1 mini and a buck converter. This allows us to run ESPHome on a Wemos D1 mini which outputs a 25khz PWM signal to control the speed of an off the shelf 120mm computer fan. The whole setup is powered from a single micro USB port and with this fan, draws a max of 0.3A at 5v so it’ll run off a power bank for hours.</description>

      <description>In 2020 I wanted to create annotated charts showing events influencing the COVID-19 numbers. I looked around and didn’t find great ways to do it, so of course, as a software engineer, I started building a thing: contextualize.ai.
Fast forward many weekends, and lots and lots of hours around my 9-5s, I get the project to a level where I’m not absolutely embarrassed by around a month ago and start building and sharing charts with it.</description>

      <title>My bug finding chronicles (and how to earn money through vulnerability research)</title>
      <link>https://mijailovic.net/2023/08/16/bug-finding-chronicles/</link>
      <description>At least one person has asked me about my thought process when searching for denial-of-service
vulnerabilities: how do I choose the target libraries, what specifically I look for in them, etc.
“At least one person” meaning “exactly one person”, and that one person happens to be my wife, but
I decided to write a whole post on this topic anyway! In this half-memoir,
half-tutorial post, I’ll show you the most interesting bugs I’ve found so far and the methods I
used to find them. I wouldn’t say I have any advanced bug finding skills, but I do know a few useful
techniques, so I hope you will learn something new today.</description>

      <title>Map Physical Paths with an HttpContext.MapPath() Extension Method in ASP.NET</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Aug/15/Map-Physical-Paths-with-an-HttpContextMapPath-Extension-Method-in-ASPNET</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core doesn&amp;#39;t have a Server.MapPath() method as classic ASP.NET had, and getting at the root path in Core is a little bit more involved than in those older versions. In this post I describe how to find the application Content and Web root folders and describe a MapPath() helper that simulates the old behavior.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on the Remarkable 2 – various bits</title>
      <link>https://variousbits.net/2023/08/13/thoughts-on-the-remarkable-2/</link>
      <description>I’m two weeks into owning a Remarkable 2. I spent at least a year, maybe two, circling around whether to get one or not and finally took the plunge at the end of July. Key to the whole project to me was spending less time staring at the glare. I wanted something to read and scribble on but without the distraction that comes with All The Things.</description>

      <title>The Irrational Planning Process – The Antiplanner</title>
      <link>https://ti.org/antiplanner/?p=21276</link>
      <description>Land-use and transportation planning is supposed to follow a rational planning process. That process includes defining the problem that needs to be solved, identifying alternative solutions, evaluating the alternatives, developing a final plan based on the best alternative or combination of alternatives, implementing the plan, monitoring the effects to see how well reality matches planning assumptions, and using the results of that monitoring as feedback into future plans.</description>

      <title>Cool your heels, Emacs</title>

      <description>TL;DR: Sometimes Emacs needs a timeout
  A diamond is very pretty. But it is very hard to add to a diamond. A ball of mud is not so pretty. But you can always add more mud to a ball of mud.
– Gerald Sussman, paraphrasing Joel Moses
  A common problem with Emacs’ giant ball of shared state: Any code can step on the feet of any other – including yours.</description>

      <description>In the recently created FreeBSD VPS, the network performance of vnet-enabled jails was significantly lower compared to that of traditional jails. Upon investigation, it appears that there is an issue related to Virtio drivers.</description>

      <description>The word transpiler is often used by people when they want to say that built a tool that transforms programs between languages of
roughly the same level of abstraction. This tool is different from a compiler which often has a complex frontend, an optimizing
middle end, and code generators for various backends.</description>
