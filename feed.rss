      <title>Writing JIT Compiler on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://laplab.me/posts/writing-jit-compiler-on-the-plane/</link>
      <description>Feel free to join the discussion on HackerNews.
 Compilers always seemed a little bit like magic to me. You write the code in some language and then it spits out bitcode that a small crystall inside your computer understands.
Some databases ship with a specialized compiler inside them. This compiler can generate assembly code for parts of the query that are executed often. Such technique is called JIT compilation and can greatly reduce the interpretation overhead during query execution.</description>

      <title>What is bloat and why is it slowly killing most products</title>
      <link>https://kashishhora.com/what-is-bloat-and-why-is-it-slowly-killing-most-products/</link>
      <description>If you ask any long-time fan of a popular app or software product that’s been around for a while, they’ll have some gripes about how “it’s changed” and “it used to be better” and exhibit some nostalgic longing for the older, simpler times. It’s pretty much a universal trend.
But there seems to be some truth to this reaction. I’m sure you’ve noticed how certain apps on your phone, over time, have gotten so complicated and have so many features that you never use.</description>

      <title>How I think about C99 strict aliasing rules</title>
      <link>https://alanwu.space/post/strict-aliasing/</link>
      <description>Recently I was asked about how to review C99 code for problems that arise from failing to follow the so called “strict aliasing rules”. I struggled to present my thought process while vetting code for this class of problems, so I thought I would write a post to hopefully make my explanation more coherent.
The strict aliasing rules can be surprising because the way optimizers take advantage of them doesn’t mesh well with the popular belief that pointers are “just numbers”.</description>
