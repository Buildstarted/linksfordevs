      <title>When Flat Rate Movers Won't Answer Your Calls</title>
      <link>https://aphyr.com/posts/381-when-flat-rate-movers-wont-answer-your-calls</link>
      <description>Back in 2023 I went through an inter-state move with Flat Rate Movers,
LTD. (US DOT 488466, MC 254356). They bungled the job, damaged my stuff
and my house, and then refused to talk to me or their own insurance company. I
placed dozens of calls, wrote letters, emails, nothing worked. I finally got
some money for the damage by working with their insurer directly. I know a lot
of folks struggle with moving companies, and figured I’d write up a bit of this
story in case it helps. You can skip ahead if you
just want to know about the FMCSA insurer database.</description>

      <title>ARK001: Building ARK RESTful API</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=EA1iRkhTAN4</link>
      <description>In this video, we walk through how to build a complete RESTful API for Project ARK — from clean architecture and service orchestration to database integration and automated testing. You'll see how to implement a scalable, maintainable API using modern .NET practices and set up CI/CD pipelines to ensure quality and reliability at every stage of delivery.

🔧 What You'll Learn:

Structuring your API using The Standard (The Project, The Team, The Product)

Creating controllers, services, interfaces, and repositories

Writing unit and integration tests with mocking

Setting up GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps) pipelines for automated build, test, and deployment

Applying security best practices and versioning your API

Deploying to cloud (optional: Azure Web App)

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn proper REST API practices or an experienced engineer aiming to refine your architecture and DevOps process, this is your complete guide.

📦 Tech Stack: C# .NET | Entity Framework | SQL Server | GitHub Actions | Docker | Azure

🧱 Based on principles from The Standard by Hassan Habib
