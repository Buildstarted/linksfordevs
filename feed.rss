      <title>Multi-Tenant Applications With EF Core</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/multi-tenant-applications-with-ef-core</link>
      <description> Most software applications today are built around the concept of multi-tenancy.
One application serves multiple customers, while keeping their data isolated.
You can approach multi-tenancy in two ways: - Single database &amp;amp; logical isolation of tenants - Multiple databases &amp;amp; physical isolation of tenants
Which option you decide to use will depend mostly on your requirements. Some industries like healthcare require a high degree of data isolation, and using a database per tenant is a must.
So how are we going to implement multi-tenancy support with EF Core?
We can use Query Filters to apply a tenant filter to all database queries.
Implement it once, and you can almost forget about it.</description>

      <title>Getting started with View Transitions on multi-page apps</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2023/05/getting-started-view-transitions/</link>
      <description>Spurred by last week’s ShopTalk I rolled out View Transitions here on my static Jekyll site. I hadn’t realized View Transitions for multi-page apps (MPAs) and static sites are ready for testing behind a flag in Chrome 113+. View Transitions for MPAs are a feature that’s high on my CSS wishlist, so I got to it. It took less than an hour to do, requires zero JavaScript, and two lines of CSS. I’m pleased with the results.</description>

      <title>Borys - Nonius Clock</title>
      <link>https://www.lykahb.com/projects/clock.html</link>
      <description>A modern watch is less of a practical device and more a style choice. I’d like to present a novel quirky way to display time.
This clock face only needs one moving part to tell time - the rotating ring. Yet, unlike a clock with only an hour hand, it has a precision of under one minute. The idea is to add an auxiliary set of minute and hour marks - similar to the design of a vernier scale or nonius on the measuring instruments.</description>

      <title>Glassdoor review of Stack Overflow: Management feudalism means your mileage may vary</title>
      <link>https://jlericson.com/2023/05/18/glass_door_reviews.html</link>
      <description>On July 20, 2020, about 6 months after I left the company, I wrote a
review of Stack Overflow on
Glassdoor.
Glassdoor&amp;#39;s model requires people to regularly submit information to
their database in order to view contributions. This includes your own
contributions. Since I wrote about the company&amp;#39;s
business, I decided to seek out my
review and see if it held up. I don&amp;#39;t feel like paying the
contribution tax to see my own content in the future so I decided to
save a copy. And where better than my own blog?
