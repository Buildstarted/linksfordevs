      <title>Steve Ballmer was an underrated CEO</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/ballmer/</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s a common narrative that Microsoft was moribund under Steve Ballmer and then later saved by the miraculous leadership of Satya Nadella. This is the dominant narrative in every online discussion about the topic I&amp;#39;ve seen and it&amp;#39;s a commonly expressed belief &amp;quot;in real life&amp;quot; as well. While I don&amp;#39;t have anything negative to say about Nadella&amp;#39;s leadership in this post, this narrative underrates Ballmer&amp;#39;s role in Microsoft&amp;#39;s success. Not only did Microsoft&amp;#39;s financials, revenue and profit, look great under Ballmer, Microsoft under Ballmer made deep, long-term bets that set up Microsoft for success in the decades after his reign. At the time, the bets were widely panned, indicating that they weren&amp;#39;t necessarily obvious, but we can see in retrospect that the company made very strong bets despite the criticism at the time.</description>

Learn how to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) in your .NET applications using Debezium, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ with MassTransit. In this tutorial, I&amp;#39;ll show you how to:

- Set up Debezium to capture database changes
- Configure PostgreSQL for CDC
- Stream changes to RabbitMQ
- Process events with MassTransit in .NET
- Implement real-time data synchronization

Perfect for building event-driven architectures, data replication systems, or keeping your microservices in sync. See how these powerful tools work together to create a robust CDC pipeline.

      <description>The Go compiler skips files ending with _test.go during normal compilation.
They are compiled with go test command (together will all other .go files),
which also inserts some chutney to run the test functions. The standard way to
do testing is to have a foo.go and foo_test.go file next to each other.</description>

      <title>Process Optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.craigpardey.com/post/2024-10-27-process-optimization/</link>
      <description>
Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased –  Eliyahu M. Goldratt, The Goal, 1984

Turning this around we get the corollory that optimizations made to areas other than the constraint only serve to worsen the constraint.
Agile practices, and particularly Scrum and SAFe, have been widely adopted in large enterprises over the last decade or so, spawning entirely new departments dedicated to locking down the process. Agile Centers of Excellence (CoEs) produce materials explicitly describing every aspect of their company’s specific flavour of Agile, and have coaches dedicated to enforcing it across the teams.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Model in LLVM - Part II</title>
      <link>https://myhsu.xyz/llvm-sched-model-1.5/</link>
      <description>In the previous post, we covered the basics of scheduling model in LLVM. Specifically, per-operand tokens that connect an instruction with models that spell out processor-specific scheduling properties like instruction latency, and the concept of processor resources with different sizes of buffer.
While I was planning to write how scheduling models are used in this post – namely, covering things like instruction scheduler and MCA – the draft was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content needed to cover just the substrate.</description>

      <title>So Long WordPress</title>
      <link>https://chriswiegman.com/2024/10/so-long-wordpress/</link>
      <description>This has been a hard post for me to write after participating in WordPress since before I even started a career in tech and, until 3 months ago, for my entire tech career. That said, it has been in the making for quite a while now and it is time that I make it official.
I’ve officially left the WordPress project after 14+ years of contributing including:
Meetup and WordCamp Speaker Meetup and WordCamp Organizer Core code contributor Plugin developer Photo contributor Over 11 years as mostly the sole moderator for the official WordPress jobs site Why leave now? It’s true that I had largely been moving away from the WordPress project since at least 2017. I think that is when I realized just how dishonest so much of the “community” around WordPress really is.</description>

      <title>What’s New in POSIX 2024 – XCU</title>
      <link>https://blog.toast.cafe/posix2024-xcu</link>
      <description>In the 1950s, computers did not really interoperate. ARPANET has not yet happened (that would become a thing in the 60s), and every operating system was typically tied to the hardware that was meant to run on. Most communication actually happened over telephone, and no company was more present in that space than the Bell System. Unfortunately, the way they were so present was through exclusive supply contracts (with its subsidiary Western Electric) and a vast array of patents that it would refuse to license to competitors. So they got an antitrust suit aimed at them, which after seven years of litigation culminated in the 1956 consent decree. The Bell System was broken up, obliged to license all of its patents royalty-free, and barred from entering any industry other than telecommunications. So they made Unix.</description>

      <title>Cool LED Plate Frame: How it Works, and IS IT LEGAL?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hjcdn35lPeo</link>
      <description>In this episode, I show off a custom laser-engraved acrylic license plate cover I modified with an ESP32 microcontroller to create dynamic lighting effects. You’ll see how I integrated it with LEDs for colors, wipes, fades, and even a flame effect. We dive into the science behind linear fiber optics and total internal reflection, plus explore how the etched design channels the light just where it’s needed.

Finally, we tackle the big question: is this legal for the road? We review both federal and state laws and examine the nuances that determine what’s street-legal.

If you enjoy tech, optics, or unique car mods, stick around for today’s deep dive in Dave’s Garage!
