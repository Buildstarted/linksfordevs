      <description>The other day I made a small web service
with Repl.it that does a simple transformation on an RSS feed (source
code). I created it mainly because of
this excellent newsletter, which is a daily
roundup of potentially interesting, non-commercial blog posts from Hacker News
that didn&amp;#39;t hit the front page. I&amp;#39;ve found quite a few good articles from it.</description>

      <title>What I learned doing 125 public talks - Part I</title>
      <link>https://blog.mgechev.com/2020/11/26/what-i-learned-doing-100-public-talks-part-i/</link>
      <description>Over the past 7 years, I gave over 125+ talks for 20 countries in front of over 50,000+ people. By any means, this doesn’t make me an expert in public speaking, but I had the opportunity to learn a few things that I’d love to share.
I’ll spread the content between a couple of different posts covering everything from planning, preparing the talk, rehearsals, and presentation at the event. I’d not discuss research, but this phase will naturally produce artifacts for the planning process.</description>

They are backed by promises to make good on their debts by the receivers of newly minted USDTs. While it’s not fraudulent per se, the fact that USDTs aren’t backed by US dollars …</description>
