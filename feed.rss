      <title>Two Attacks on Naive Tree Hashes</title>
      <link>https://jacko.io/tree_hashing.html</link>
      <description>If you're building a tree hash,​also known as a Merkle tree and you want it to have the same
security properties as a cryptographic hash like SHA-3 or BLAKE3, there are a
couple of "attacks" you need to know about. Here's a naive recursive tree hash
based on SHA-3 in Python, which turns out to be vulnerable to these
attacks:​Dividing the length by 2 at each level of the tree like this is a
shortcut, but the resulting tree structure isn't great, because we have to
know the final input length to figure out where any of the leaf or subtree
boundaries are. That's no problem in these examples, but in practice most
hash functions need to be able to "stream" long inputs in a loop
without knowing the final length until the end. A better splitting rule for
real tree hashes is to make the left side as large as possible as long as
it's a power-of-2. See the BLAKE3 paper, particularly sections 2.1 and
5.1.2, and also Binary Numeral Trees.</description>

      <description>One challenge: there are a lot of comments. How
many? I got curious about analyzing the XML, and
then of course I wanted to do that from Emacs. I
used pipx install yq to install yq so that I
could use the xq tool to query the XML, much like
jq works.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Dijkstra’s Note on “Why Numbering Should Start at Zero”</title>
      <link>https://fabiendubosson.com/blog/unpacking-dijkstra-note-on-why-numbering-should-start-at-zero/</link>
      <description>Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote a famous note titled “Why numbering should start at zero” This three-page handwritten document is often cited in discussions about why indexing in programming languages should start at zero. While his reasoning is relatively straightforward, the document lacks the structure and examples needed to fully grasp it—at least for me—without resorting to pen and paper. As a result, I decided to read it thoroughly and unpack his reasoning into explicit arguments, expressed in my own words and illustrated with examples.</description>

      <description>The World Wide Web started as a web of documents. That was back in the early ’90s. Web pages were static HTML documents—simple, read-only pages that just presented information. There was no interactivity. Then, in 1995, JavaScript was added to browsers, changing everything.</description>

      <description>This is a quick fix to a problem I experienced with Open WebUI, which was that custom models were not showing in the models list. There was nothing in the documentation or in the issues pointing to a solution. I decided to open a new issue 4 days ago and today the user @dcolley gave the missing information and it worked.
For some reason, custom models are not working when you use Direct Connections.</description>

      <description>I rebuilt (the top-50 popcon) Debian and Ubuntu packages, on amd and arm64, and compared the results a couple of months ago. Since then the Reproduce.Debian.net effort has been launched. Unlike my small experiment, that effort is a full-scale rebuild with more architectures. Their goal is to reproduce what is published in the Debian archive.</description>

      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2025-03-30-bootstrap-ranking-llm-judge/</link>
      <description>I use 500 Hacker News (HN) titles and an LLM to derive an article ranking
model from a user supplied preference description. The LLM supplies the
labelled data, whilst Ridge regression and cheap sentence transformer
embedding provides the features. The surrogate has 0.74 Spearman correlation
with the LLM labels, which is remarkable given that the experiment is entirely
unoptimised.</description>
