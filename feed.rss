      <title>Context-Free Grammar Parsing with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/context-free-grammar-parsing-with-llms</link>
      <description>Last week, I open-sourced a method to coerce LLMs into only generating a specific structure for a given regex pattern (ReLLM on Github). The library has proven extremely useful for a handful of tasks I’ve been doing with LLMs (everything from categorization to simple agent automation).

However, I left a part of it as “an exercise to the reader.” I claimed it could also coerce LLMs into only generating more complex structures, like valid JSON or XML. However, I didn’t show a worked example. The </description>

      <title>Messaging Patterns in Bash &amp;#183; m10k</title>
      <link>https://m10k.eu/2023/05/06/toolbox-messaging.html</link>
      <description>Around the time when I was implementing queues in toolbox,
I was reading Enterprise Integration Patterns, a book about messaging patterns, written by
Gregor Hohpe (whom I worked with more than a decade ago) and Bobby Woolf. While reading the
book, I thought how awesome it would be if I could use my queues to implement messaging in
Bash — and that’s how I got inspired to write the uipc module. Because there is no documentation
but an API reference, I decided to
write a few articles about how the uipc module can be used to implement some of the messaging
patterns from the book.</description>

      <title>How to evaluate a game for your startup?</title>
      <link>https://rnikhil.com/2023/05/14/evaluating-games.html</link>
      <description>As a product manager working in gaming, its impossible to miss the recent rise of multi gaming platforms which package multiple individual games together inside one app. Doing this has a lot of benefits and you can read my previous blog posts to better understand how bundling benefits everybody in the ecosystem. In this post, we investigate intrinsic aspects of a game apart from their powerUser:casualUser ratio and delve deeper into what makes a game successful by itself. In the previous post, we looked at how different games interact with each other inside a MGP and in this post, we will look at ways in no particular order to evaluate a game in isolation. All games are looked at from a real money gaming POV.</description>

      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/maui-applications-in-net-7-with-maddy-montaquila-episode-244</link>
      <description>Maddy Montaquila is a Senior Product Manager on the .NET MAUI team and has been working with .NET mobile apps since 2018 working on Xamarin tooling. When she first joined Microsoft and worked with the Xamarin team as an intern, she realized the impact that she could have in creating amazing developer tools and frameworks, which inspired her to pursue a role as Program Manager. You can connect with her on Twitter and GitHub @maddymontaquila! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [4:21] How did Maddy get lucked into development and the mobile side of product management? [7:39] You can distill product manager roles to the intersection of the technology and what’s possible, the business, what’s going to make you money, and what your customers actually want and need. [9:17] Why is it important for program managers to have at least some coding background? [10:41] When people dive into Maui, what can they expect right now? [15:44] What tools or resources does someone need to get started, and what are the limitations? [20:44] What is the current DevOps story for going from a developer workstation all the way through testing and packaging, and then finally delivering it to the App Store? [23:47] Is there a favorite deployed test framework? [27:26] Why does Maddy prefer sometimes to work in Xaml? [29:17] If you’re going to reach for controls right now, is everything that they need built-in? What is the status of DevExpress? [37:03] It’s a great time to be a .net developer! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:     — New Video Podcast!
