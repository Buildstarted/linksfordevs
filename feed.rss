      <title>Azure Active Directory&amp;#39;s gateway is on .NET 6.0!</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure-active-directorys-gateway-is-on-net-6-0/</link>
      <description>Azure Active Directory’s gateway service is a reverse proxy that fronts hundreds of services that make up Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). If you’ve used services such as office.com, outlook.com, portal.azure.com or xbox.live.com, then you’ve used Azure AD’s gateway. The gateway provides features such as TLS termination,</description>

      <title>A practical use for GetHGlobal&amp;#173;FromStream when sharing was never your intention</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211115-00/?p=105922</link>
      <description>A little while ago, I noted that managing shared access to the HGLOBAL inside a stream can get tricky, and opined that the GetHGlobal&amp;#173;FromStream should have been something like IStream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal::Detach&amp;#173;HGlobal. But in fact there’s a straightforward use case for GetHGlobal&amp;#173;FromStream even when there is no sharing going on.</description>

      <title>Getting started with GraphQL in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/getting-started-with-graphql-aspnetcore/</link>
      <description>This post is about GraphQL in ASP.NET Core. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. GraphQL implemented using HotChocolate package. To get started, create an empty web project using dotnet web command and then add reference of HotChocolate.AspNetCore package using dotnet add package HotChocolate.AspNetCore command. Once it is done, you can modify the program.cs file like following. I am using .NET 6.0 for this. So there is no Startup.cs and configure and configureservices() methods.</description>

      <title>SoK: Cryptographic Confidentiality of Data on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11007</link>
      <description>Mobile devices have become an indispensable component of modern life. Their
high storage capacity gives these devices the capability to store vast amounts
of sensitive personal data, which makes them a high-value target: these devices
are routinely stolen by criminals for data theft, and are increasingly viewed
by law enforcement agencies as a valuable source of forensic data. Over the
past several years, providers have deployed a number of advanced cryptographic
features intended to protect data on mobile devices, even in the strong setting
where an attacker has physical access to a device. Many of these techniques
draw from the research literature, but have been adapted to this entirely new
problem setting.
  This involves a number of novel challenges, which are incompletely addressed
in the literature. In this work, we outline those challenges, and systematize
the known approaches to securing user data against extraction attacks. Our work
proposes a methodology that researchers can use to analyze cryptographic data
confidentiality for mobile devices. We evaluate the existing literature for
securing devices against data extraction adversaries with powerful capabilities
including access to devices and to the cloud services they rely on. We then
analyze existing mobile device confidentiality measures to identify research
areas that have not received proper attention from the community and represent
opportunities for future research.</description>

      <description>So over the last few weeks Linus and Luke over at LTT / FloatPlane have been teasing us with tales of their so-called Linux Challenge.  The basic premise being that whichever of them can switch from Windows to Linux on their daily driver home PCs, wins the challenge.  Simple enough, right?  Well as it turns out, not actually.</description>

      <title>The weirdest bug I&amp;#39;ve ever encountered</title>
      <link>https://mental-reverb.com/blog.php?id=29</link>
      <description>I am responsible for the reliability of the firmware updates on our devices and this work never gets boring. The thing about firmware updates is that by definition, every bug is caused by the updater because before installing the affected version, the bug was not present. You could say that updates are the cause and the solution of all software problems. So, a lot of update bug reports that find their way to me have nothing to do with the updater per se, they just manifest themselves immediately, giving the impression that the updater is broken. But I&amp;#39;m getting ahead of myself, so let&amp;#39;s start from the beginning.</description>
