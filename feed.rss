      <title>TPM remote attestation over Bluetooth</title>
      <link>https://gabriel.kerneis.info/2021/11/local_attestation/</link>
      <description>How can you be sure that the software running on your computer has not been tampered with since you installed it? Even if your disk is encrypted, how can you be sure that the password prompt at boot is not a trap planted by an evil third-party that will exfiltrate all your data? Those are the some of the questions that the field of “secure computing” tries to address. The answers are built through complex combinations of hardware (CPU, TPM, flash memory) and software (BIOS, OS) components.</description>

      <link>https://ulrichkautz.com/posts/2021-11-24_personal-knowledge-management-that-works/</link>
      <description>I was interested in the topic of personal knowledge management since I first used a computer for learning. So far I could not find a solution that really worked well for me. Until now. I found my second brain. If you are a knowledge worker as well, are not gifted with a perfect memory and therefore need a tooling to help you manage the knowledge you learn - read on in the blog post.

      <description>I&amp;#39;m living in a place with not the fastest internet download/upload (39/12 Mbps) speeds. It took some time to tune all the parameters of the Rclone to successfully create an initial backup (around 400GB) and keep the network alive during the upload to Backblaze B2.

      <title>Practical Security Recommendations for Start-ups with Limited Budgets</title>
      <link>https://ajxchapman.github.io/security/2021/11/10/practical-security-recommendations-for-startups.html</link>
      <description>Hi, my name is Alex, I’ve been an IT security professional since 2007 and I’ve recently entered the start-up world with my project bughuntr.io. In putting together this project, security has been a primary concern for me. This is both due to my background and the nature of the project, being a training platform for security professionals and enthusiasts alike. In my security career, I’ve been hired to assess countless web applications, cloud environments and computer networks for security vulnerabilities. In these assessments, it is always clear when security is ‘bolted on’ as a compliance requirement before releasing a product, or added at a later date in response to an incident. Start-ups have a rare opportunity to ‘bake’ security in at the start of a project, but this is often seen as an expensive endeavor. In this post, I aim to ease that fear and provide practical (and cheap) advice for start-ups who want to release a more secure product right from the start.</description>

      <title>Simplicity always wins</title>
      <link>https://bruno-oliveira.github.io/techblog/simple-stacks-win/</link>
      <description>Software engineers love complexity. Complexity is an inherent part of writing software because the medium itself (programming languages) is complex on its own. When you put together with it the discipline of doing software engineering, where you add time constraints, customers, budgets and changing requirements… well… it’s complicated.

      <title>How did Windows 3.1&amp;#39;s virtual machine manager get the information to show in the text-mode Alt+Tab switcher?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211129-00/?p=105979</link>
      <description>When I told the life story of the Switch&amp;#173;To&amp;#173;This&amp;#173;Window function, some people were curious about how the virtual machine manager knew about the current windows and their z-order, so that it could show them in the fake text-mode Alt+Tab switcher.

      <description>Supposedly today we have a lot of browsers to choose from - Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, etc. Having choices is a good thing, right?
