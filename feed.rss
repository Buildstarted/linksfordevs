      <title>How to Disable GitHub Actions in a Forked Project</title>
      <link>https://seankilleen.com/2021/11/how-to-disable-github-actions-in-a-forked-project/</link>
      <description>Some GitHub repositories have GitHub Actions with helpful automation. Because actions are stored in the .github folder within a codebase, they come over along with any forks that are created. In many cases, this could be really helpful, as you get a great level of automation out of the box.</description>

      <title>Access data with managed identity - Azure App Service</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/access-data-with-managed-identity-azure-app-service/</link>
      <description>This post is about connecting and accessing data from SQL Service using Azure App Service Managed Identity feature. Azure SQL supports Azure AD authentication, which means it also supports the Managed Identity feature of Azure AD. With Managed Identity, we no longer need the User Id and Password as part of your connection string. The credential is managed automatically by Azure and allows us to connect to resources.</description>

      <title>Introducing River, a Dynamic Tiling Wayland Compositor</title>
      <link>https://isaacfreund.com/blog/river-intro/</link>
      <description>In the spring of 2020 I found myself hooked on Wayland thanks to
sway but increasingly frustrated with the
i3 style window management sway implements.
I tried several of the other more mature Wayland compositors
including hikari and
Wayfire but didn’t enjoy them any more
than sway. I wanted dynamic tiling window management similar to
dwm but on Wayland and without dwm’s configuration
through patching the source code approach.</description>

      <title>NSwag generated C# client: Open API property name clashes and decimal types rather than double | I CAN MAKE THIS WORK</title>
      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/10/31/nswag-generated-c-sharp-client-property-name-clash/</link>
      <description>NSwag is a great tool for generating client libraries in C# and TypeScript from Open API / Swagger definitions. You can face issues where Open API property names collide due to the nature of the C# language, and when you want to use decimal for your floating point numeric type over double. This post demonstrates how to get over both issues.</description>

      <title>Your Startup Needs a Murder Board</title>
      <link>https://blog.babegriffey.com/your-startup-needs-a-murder-board</link>
      <description>A murder board is a committee of subject matter experts designed to critically expose risks in technical operations or projects where failure is not an option. More specifically, their job is to kill proposals on technical merit by aggressively reviewing a situation&amp;#39;s problem, assumptions, constraints, and the proffered solution—aka mitigate risk.</description>

      <description>PHP, as the result of a spectacular error of judgement, appears to be written in US English. How do we developers ensure the traditions of the British Empire continue to be upheld, even in the digital age?</description>

      <title>Discovering new C# String Pattern Matching Features</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Nov/04/Discovering-new-C-String-Pattern-Matching-Features</link>
      <description>I admit it: I haven&amp;#39;t been using the new C# pattern matching features a lot, but every once in a while ReSharper smacks me in the head and points out a good pattern that not only makes the code more compact, but also makes it more readable. In this post I talk about a few patterns that help with null and string casting and with comparing values in a more natural way.</description>

      <title>Combating Disinformation with Humility. – Pravesh Koirala</title>
      <link>https://praveshkoirala.com/2021/11/03/combating-disinformation-with-humility/</link>
      <description>For as long as media has existed, certain actors have always tried to manipulate it in order to win favor from the people (increased revenue, cultivating a good image of self, disavowing rivals, inter-alia). However, this practice has now become significantly pronounced due to the ubiquity of the Internet. Corporates, Business Rivals, Nation-States, and Criminal Organizations alike want to influence their target crowd in one way or another to achieve a diverse set of strategic objectives. And they absolutely do not hesitate to employ the means of Disinformation. Be it the denigration of Covid vaccines or promotion of a particular election candidate, we have seen the usage of Disinformation time and time again, and it is unlikely that this practice would stop without an effective intervention from the corresponding governments.</description>

      <title>How (Not) to Design a Hash Function</title>
      <link>https://m1el.github.io/refterm-hash/</link>
      <description>Recently, Casey Muratori has implemented a proof-of-concept terminal,
which is designed around fast input processing and rendering.  This is an important
and commendable effort, since the vast majority of software performs tens to
thousands of times slower than it can.[citation needed]

One of the design choices of refterm is to use a hash table to cache glyph rendering.
The key in this table is the UTF-8 string of a single glyph.  To avoid string
allocations, the hash value of the glyph bytes is used as a key instead.

When Casey got asked about the possibility of hash collisions on stream,
he responded with a claim that the hash function used in refterm is “a strong hash”,
and the complexity to find collision is about 2^64 operations.
After analyzing the code for the hash function used in refterm, a few flaws
were found in the hash function, and O(1) attacks were discovered.
