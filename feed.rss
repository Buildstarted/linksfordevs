      <title>Microsoft Campus Tours - Inside the NEW Channel 9 Studio</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HxnXO3YwMo&amp;feature=youtu.be</link>
      <description>A little bit over a year ago, Golnaz, Kaitlin, and Matthew crawled out of a windowless studio and saw the sun for the first time in years. Their old manager, Larry, decided to help rebuild a studio so they could see the sun more regularly. Thus, the new Channel 9 Studio was born.

After a year of enjoying their new digs, Golnaz, Kaitlin, and Matthew, joined by Cameron and Christina, want to show you around. It's like a housewarming, but with minimal social interaction, zero small talk, and you don't need to leave the comfort of your own couch. Enjoy.</description>

      <description>As of this month, I will have been employed at Microsoft for 5 years. I joined the .NET team when I
                    was 24
                    years old. Now at 29, I'm still here and thoroughly enjoying it. It's been a great time overall.
                    I've learned so much more than
                    I ever would have imagined, met so many wonderful people, and helped make some things that people
                    enjoy. Here's what I remember the most in those years.</description>

      <link>http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/</link>
      <description>2020 is a watershed year for machine
              learning. It has seen the true arrival of commodized machine
              learning, where deep learning models and algorithms are readily
              available to Internet users. GPUs are cheaper and more readily
              available than ever, and new training methods like transfer
              learning have made it possible to train powerful deep learning models using
              smaller sets of data.</description>

      <description>We keep hearing many of you are eager to host gRPC-enabled services on IIS in Azure, such as here on GitHub. However, the lack of support for several HTTP features in the platform components is blocking you. We listened, and we have good news: we built HTTP support for gRPC into Http.sys! We are tar...</description>

      <title>First Ever Image of a Multi-Planet System around a Sun-like Star Captured by ESO Telescope</title>
      <link>https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2011/?lang=</link>
      <description>The European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (ESO’s VLT) has taken the first ever image of a young, Sun-like star accompanied by two giant exoplanets. Images of systems with multiple exoplanets are extremely rare, and — until now — astronomers had never directly observed more than one planet orbiting a star similar to the Sun. The observations can help astronomers understand how planets formed and evolved around our own Sun.</description>
