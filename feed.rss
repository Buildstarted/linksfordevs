      <title>Beyond the Code - An Engineer’s Battle Against Knowledge Loss</title>
      <link>https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/10/battle-against-knowledge-loss.html</link>
      <description>The idea for this article arose during a meeting where we learned that our supervisor would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities. In response, a
colleague lamented that what we would miss most is the knowledge departing with the leader. Unfortunately, that’s how it goes. Not only do we lose a colleague,
but we also lose valuable knowledge and experience. However, this isn’t a story about my supervisor; it’s a story about all those individuals who are experts in
their fields, who understand the paths to success and paths that lead to catastrophic failures. When they leave, they take with them knowledge that you won’t
find in any book, note, or Jira ticket. And this leads to a fundamental question: What can be done to avoid this “black hole” of knowledge? How can we ensure
it doesn’t vanish along with them? That’s what this article is all about.

      <title>Wait... I should consider .net?</title>
      <link>https://mattkaras.info/posts/blazor/</link>
      <description>I’ve done mostly Python and C++ for my software development career. I used C++ in constrained environments where clock cycles mattered, and Python when we needed to iterate quickly and be productive. They felt like different ends of the spectrum, and I learned what I liked and didn’t like about both languages.
Python Likes: Flexible Productive Standard library Lots of good libraries on Pypi Python Dislikes: Environment management Not efficient You have to accept dynamic typing C++ Likes: Speed and efficiency STL - good C++ is elegant C++ Dislikes: CMAKE Undefined behavior Older code - bad C++ gives Perl a run for its money.</description>

Help us Sad Bastards!

Amazon in all its wisdom has taken down the Sad Bastard Cookbook. They won&amp;#39;t tell us why. They won&amp;#39;t tell us how to fix whatever tripped the algorithm. They won&amp;#39;t seem to let us appeal. Reaching a human at Amazon is a Kafkaesque experience that we haven&amp;#39;t yet managed to do.

Not only does this affect our ability to distribute it free to depressed, disabled, and broke folks, but the paperback is a big source of income for us. Anyone fought the &amp;#39;Zon and won? Help!</description>
