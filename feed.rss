      <title>RAG Pipelines from scratch</title>
      <link>https://www.zansara.dev/posts/2023-10-27-haystack-series-rag/</link>
      <description>Last updated: 21/11/2023 - Read it on the Haystack Blog.
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is quickly becoming an essential technique to make LLMs more reliable and effective at answering any question, regardless of how specific. To stay relevant in today’s NLP landscape, Haystack must enable it.
Let’s see how to build such applications with Haystack 2.0, from a direct call to an LLM to a fully-fledged, production-ready RAG pipeline that scales.</description>

      <link>https://johnjonesfour.com/2023/12/01/nighttime-time-lapse-photography-with-allsky/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago, I came across an intriguing article on IEEE Spectrum featuring a Raspberry Pi sky time-lapse project. The project utilized the standard Raspberry Pi HQ camera with a wide-angle lens, running an open-source program called AllSky to control and export time-lapse videos. Being fascinated by the intersection of cameras and astronomy, I couldn&amp;#39;t resist taking on this project.</description>

      <title>My Personal Data Backup Pipeline – Justin Paulin</title>
      <link>https://justinpaulin.com/2023/11/27/my-personal-data-backup-pipeline/</link>
      <description>After hearing about folks having months of their Google Drive data disappear the other day, I figured that some might find how I mitigate risks like these with my personal data backup pipeline interesting. I’ve run this pipeline in this or a similar form for more than two years now, with only a few manual interventions required during that time. Each part of the pipeline is independently monitored, and I’ve run DR drills to ensure that everything is recoverable, if necessary, from only Backblaze. Here’s how it works:</description>

      <description>Introduction For 32 years now, the venerable HTTP protocol has been at the heart of the Web. This protocol enables &amp;quot;resources&amp;quot; (anything that can be named can be a resource, but these are often documents) to be retrieved from a server using their unique identifier: their URL. Since 1991, the Web has exploded in popularity,</description>

      <title>Matrix vs. XMPP | Luke&amp;#39;s Webpage</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/matrix-vs-xmpp/</link>
      <description>What are XMPP and Matrix and what makes them special? XMPP and Matrix are two decentralized and federated free sofware projects for chat, including true end-to-end encrypted chat.
Users can either install the software on their own server if they want, but they can also easily register on any public server—both allow any XMPP or Matrix user to talk to users on their server or on any other one. In essence, it works like email: you might have an email account on a different site than your friend, but all accounts on all sites can communicate.</description>

      <description>Example from yesterday’s news. Count ’em yourself – there’s 76 of them there.
Mass i18n efforts like this are I think an underappreciated benefit of what static site generators like Hugo can give you. Actually, especialy Hugo – it’s multi-language support is very good, like darn near everything about the platform once you get past the initial learning curve.
Another underappreciated benefit: When building HTML pages is fast, you can afford to build a lot of them.</description>

      <title>Goodbye DevRel… (for now)</title>
      <link>https://spinscale.de/posts/2023-11-28-goodbye-devrel.html</link>
      <description>After almost four years of developer advocacy as my main job, I am going back to software engineering. This blog post is my venting rant about what I think is going wrong with developer advocacy/devrel/you-name-it at the moment and why it’s not for me at its current state.
I think there is a major mismatch between company expectations what developer relations are able to achieve and deliver and what happens in the real world, especially if your product is closed source.</description>
