      <description>Opening Windows Terminal from another application is a bit of a pain. In particular I wanted to open Windows Terminal as an External Tool from Visual Studio and found it wasn&amp;#39;t as easy as referencing the `wt.exe` executable. Opening as an Administrator adds additional complexity. In this post I&amp;#39;ll talk about the use case of an External Tools and the settings to launch both a regular and admin Windows Terminal instance from External Tools.</description>

      <description>This article shows you how to work with SSL certificates in Azure App Service. Last year I wrote a blog post on how to use Azure App Service managed certificates. If you’re using App service managed certificates, you don’t need to worry about the expiry, it will get renewed automatically by Azure. If you’re using custom domain names for Azure App service you will be able to configure SSL certificates to the custom domain name. To create custom TLS/SSL bindings for your App Service app, your App Service plan must be in the Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated tier.</description>

      <title>Ideas That Created the Future</title>
      <link>https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future?hss_channel=tw-20774514</link>
      <description>Classic papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Norbert Wiener and Gordon Moore that chart the evolution of computer science.
                
                    Ideas That Created the Future collects forty-six classic papers in computer science that map the evolution of the field. It covers all aspects of computer science: theory and practice, architectures and algorithms, and logic and software systems, with an emphasis on the period of 1936–1980 but also including important earlier work. Offering papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Alan Turing and Nobert Wiener, the book documents the discoveries and inventions that created today&amp;#39;s digital world. A brief essay by volume editor Harry Lewis, offering historical and intellectual context, accompanies each paper.Readers will learn that we owe to Aristotle the realization that fixed rules of logic can apply to different phenomena—that logic provides a general framework for reasoning—and that Leibniz recognized the merits of binary notation. They can read Ada Lovelace&amp;#39;s notes on L. F. Menabrea&amp;#39;s sketch of an analytical engine, George Boole&amp;#39;s attempt to capture the rules of reason in mathematical form, David Hilbert&amp;#39;s famous 1900 address, “Mathematical Problems,” and Alan Turing&amp;#39;s illumination of a metamathematical world. Later papers document the “Cambrian era” of 1950s computer design, Maurice Wilkes&amp;#39;s invention of microcode, Grace Hopper&amp;#39;s vision of a computer&amp;#39;s “education,” Ivan Sutherland&amp;#39;s invention of computer graphics at MIT, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman&amp;#39;s pioneering work on encryption, and much more. Lewis&amp;#39;s guided tour of a burgeoning field is especially welcome at a time when computer education is increasingly specialized.</description>

      <title>I Finally Started Getting Programming</title>
      <link>https://savo.rocks/posts/i-finally-started-getting-programming/</link>
      <description>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</description>

      <description>I recently lost access to a free email account I’ve had since before I can remember (though only temporarily, thank the lord). When it happened, I instantly became effectively uncontactable by a large portion of humanity. My own temporary disappearance from reality started me to thinking about how we can reuse existing infrastructure to store contact information in a durable and highly available way.</description>

      <title>A short post on Nibby, URL shorteners and the dangers of machine translation</title>
      <link>https://thecrow.uk/on-link-shorteners-and%20the-dangers-of-google-translate/</link>
      <description>Twenty years ago, URL shorteners were a godsend. A complicated, hierarchical, 300 character address could be compressed down to a dozen characters - or fewer. So this is my new effort. nib.by. Nibby. Likened to the nib of a pen. Nibby. It kind of rolls of the tongue, and despite containing more letters than I originally sought, I’m pretty happy.</description>
