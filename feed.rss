      <description>When I turned forty a couple of years ago, one of the things I did for that milestone was to go through all the journals I’ve kept from childhood through adulthood.

      <title>Embeddings are underrated</title>
      <link>https://technicalwriting.dev/ml/embeddings/overview.html</link>
      <description>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the

like Claude, Gemini, LLaMa, GPT, etc. The ML technology that might end up
having the biggest impact on technical writing is embeddings.</description>

      <title>How I ruined my vacation by reverse engineering WSC</title>
      <link>https://blog.es3n1n.eu/posts/how-i-ruined-my-vacation/</link>
      <description>In this post I will briefly describe the journey I went through while implementing defendnot, a tool that disables Windows Defender by using the Windows Security Center (WSC) service API directly.
Even though this is most likely not what you expected to see here, but rather than going into full technical details on how everything works, I will describe what rabbitholes I went through and how painful everything was due to my ✨special✨ environment.</description>
