      <title>Emoji language is the most compact</title>
      <link>http://joaomacp.github.io/2022/09/17/emoji-language-is-the-most-compact.html</link>
      <description>A few hours before playing in the 2022 US Open final, tennis player Carlos Alcaraz tweeted this &amp;#129504;❤️&amp;#129370;&amp;#129370;— Carlos Alcaraz (@carlosalcaraz) September 11, 2022 Eggs (“huevos”) in spanish means the equivalent of “balls” in english. In such a short length Carlos was able to convey the requirements for a successful final match: brains, heart, and… uuh… courage! His grandfather used to tell him that, so it must be an ancient formula. The tweet was shown on the live broadcast. Upon seeing it I was surprised at the efficiency in the length of the message vs. the intended meaning. Here is the UTF-8 encoding: &amp;#129504; F0 9F A7 A0 ❤️ EE 80 A2 &amp;#129370; F0 9F A5 9A &amp;#129370; F0 9F A5 9A</description>

      <title>Content based change detection with Make</title>
      <link>https://andydote.co.uk/2022/09/19/make-content-hash/</link>
      <description>On several occasions when building complex projects, I have been tempted to set up Bazel to help speed up the build process; after all, it has a lot to offer: only building what has changed, caching built artifacts, and sharing that cache between machines for even more speed.
TLDR We can use Make and a couple of short shell scripts to implement file content-based caching and read/write that cache to remote storage, such as S3.</description>

      <title>An extremely opinionated guide on making friends for people who are exactly like me</title>
      <link>https://blog.aadilali.com/posts/friends.html</link>
      <description>Most friends during your childhood are going to be circumstantial. You didn’t really choose where you went to school K-8 because you didn’t really choose the town you lived in or the area your parents moved to. You maybe went to the gifted program in elementary or the IB program in high school and you maybe did clubs relevant to your interests. But, for the most part, the friends you made just happened to be the people you saw everyday and you guys weren’t bonded by much more than circumstance.</description>

      <title>An X11 Apologist Tries Wayland</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2022/09/18/wayland-from-an-x-apologist.html</link>
      <description>I think it’s only fair to call me an X apologist. I get incredibly frustrated when people talk about dropping support for X11. I fight back against the notion that some day X11 will be dead and unmaintained, a curiosity of a time before. I’ve spoken to people in my circles at-length about the accessibility tools that Wayland simply hasn’t been capable of supporting that X11 has. A lot of times, I’ve ended this conversation with “Maybe 5 years from now it’ll be good”. Well it’s 5 years in since I first said those words, and you know what, I’m actually pleasantly surprised.</description>

      <title>Implementing Google Web Risk API in ASPNET Core</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/implementing-google-webrisk-aspi-in-aspnetcore/</link>
      <description>This post is about how to implement Google Web Risk API in ASP.NET Core with C#. Google Web Risk is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications check URLs against Google’s constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. It is an enterprize version of the Google Safe Browsing API. When I tried to implement this API in our application. Unfortunately I couldn’t find in C# or .NET Sample. The documentation site contains only Java sample. So I thought of posting it.</description>
