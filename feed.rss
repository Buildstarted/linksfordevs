      <title>Weekly Update 242</title>
      <link>https://www.troyhunt.com/weekly-update-242/</link>
      <description>A fairly hectic week this one, in a large part due to chasing down really flakey network issues that are causing devices (namely Shelly relays) to be inaccessible. I suspect it&amp;#39;s ARP related and as of now, it&amp;#39;s still not fully resolved. You know how much shit breaks in a</description>

      <title>How I Estimate My Tasks</title>
      <link>https://jaitl.pro/post/2021/05/08/task-estimation/</link>
      <description>Estimating a simple task isn’t a problem. The problems arise when the task is complex and unclear. Sometimes I have to estimate complex tasks to measure the sprint time or other activities. To estimate such tasks I have developed my approach over time.</description>

      <title>How to Learn Nix, Part 1: What&amp;#39;s all this about?</title>
      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/introduction/</link>
      <description>Five years ago, I migrated my VPS from Arch Linux to NixOS.
I had no idea what I was doing. I had never used Nix before. I thought I could figure it out.
Five years later, I’m still running NixOS. And I still have no idea how it works.</description>

      <title>Measure and reduce keyboard input latency with QMK on the Kinesis Advantage</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2021-05-08-keyboard-input-latency-qmk-kinesis/</link>
      <description>Over the last few years, I worked on a few projects around keyboard input latency:
In 2018, I introduced the kinX keyboard controller with 0.2ms of input latency.
In 2020, I introduced the kinT keyboard controller, which works with a wide range of Teensy micro controllers, and both the old KB500 and the newer KB600 Kinesis Advantage models.</description>

      <title>My email workflow in Fastmail - Piet van Zoen</title>
      <link>https://piet.me/my-email-workflow-in-fastmail/</link>
      <description>When I switched to Fastmail from Hey, there were elements of Hey&amp;#39;s approach that worked well for me and I wanted to replicate. I found several articles about setting up a Hey workflow with Fastmail, but the suggested setup relied on creating custom rules for each contact and I found this to be cumbersome. I figured out a slightly different approach and wanted to document what I ended up with.</description>
