      <title>I broke IKEA.</title>
      <link>https://cohost.org/sirocyl/post/2891449-i-broke-ikea</link>
      <description>(or, well, one of their delivery services.)

&amp;#128266; Just a fair warning - there are some perhaps annoying glitch sounds in the attached recording. The volumes are normalized to limit loud spikes, as they were a lot worse in person. &amp;#128517;

so, my phone service has a rather clever anti-spam tactic, which works like this:

 * I receive a phone call from an unknown number, and it goes through screening when I answer it. It rings until the fifth ring, the voicemail greeting plays out, then I&amp;#39;ve got 30 seconds to judge if it&amp;#39;s a spam robocall or if it&amp;#39;s genuine
 * If it&amp;#39;s okay, I press 1, and it interrupts the ring/voicemail sequence and I answer the call like usual.
 * If it&amp;#39;s spam, I press ### (the # key by itself normally opens my PBX menu, so it doesn&amp;#39;t go through) and hang up immediately.

Pressing ### and hanging up, will shove the call to voicemail, then launch a &amp;quot;DTMF bomb&amp;quot;, which is a rapid sequence of over a hundred tones of DTMF keysmash, even including some of the &amp;quot;ABCD&amp;quot; keys. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling##,_*,_A,_B,_C,_and_D] This has blown up spammers&amp;#39; cheapass PBXes, especially ones with poor security and too much trust given to the DTMF decoder on the call server.

So, when IKEA called from a random 1-877 number to confirm my furniture shipment worth $1200 (that&amp;#39;s the equivalent of :sixty: bl&amp;#229;haj!), the only thing it said is &amp;quot;To continue in English, please press 1.&amp;quot;... and I had no idea who it was, immediately thought it was spam, and did the ### gesture. Oops.

What follows is a transcript of the call in the recording above.

----------------------------------------

&amp;gt; &amp;quot;To continue in English, please press 1️⃣.&amp;quot;
&amp;gt; [extremely rapid DTMF spam string]

      <title>When Should Copyright Get Shorter?</title>
      <link>https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/when-should-copyright-get-shorter</link>
      <description>Information goods have private costs and public benefits. Pharmaceutical research requires upfront investment from one firm, but once a certain compound is known to be effective it’s cheap for any company to produce. Writing a novel or filming a movie takes hundreds of hours of work from an author, but once the first copy is stored digitally it doesn’t cost anything to make a million more.</description>

      <title>Is client side security dead - or a crucial part of the future?</title>
      <link>https://weizmangal.com/2024/02/10/client-side-future/</link>
      <description>Client side security is a niche tech field that seems to be unneeded for the most part. As someone who&amp;#39;s very passionate about it, that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s hard for me to accept. After Shubham Shah addressed this topic in his tweet, I elaborate into the mixed feelings I have with this field, as well as present my take on the industry and most importantly, strongly argue why I think client side security isn&amp;#39;t dying - but in fact is more crucial now than was ever before.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Capital Management</title>
      <link>https://two-wrongs.com/the-curse-of-capital-management</link>
      <description>When I worked with Dell as a primary vendor of computer hardware for a previous
job, I was surprised by how much the interaction felt like buying financial
products from a bank, rather than technology from an engineering
company.11 Being green to that sort of interaction, I even na&amp;#239;vely asked why
we didn’t speak to our house bank for the financial parts and then pay the cash
price on the technology – but apparently that’s not how things are done. I
didn’t get a good explanation, but I assume there are lots of quirks in the
contracts that make it sensible to use the Dell bank when you buy things from
Dell. Separately, I had learned that much of airlines’ profits come from money
management, and that Boeing’s downfall may be that it has become obsessed with
managing capital rather than building airplanes.22 This seems to have started
around the time they acquired McDonell–Douglas and the McDonell–Douglas finance

      <title>There should only ever be one way to express yourself</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about programming languages and their design. In her book about the divergence of the English and American languages, Lynne Murphy asks this question: wouldn’t it be great if language were logical and maximally efficient? If sentences had only as many syllables as strictly needed? If each word had a single, unique meaning? [...]</description>

      <title>CSS is Impossible and That&amp;#39;s Okay</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2024/02/19/css-impossible-thats-okay/</link>
      <description>
I have been a web developer for more than a decade, and yet, when it comes to CSS, I always feel a bit out of depth. Not only it&amp;#39;s enormously complex, its complexity is growing every year.

In the year 2023 itself, there were a dozen [new additions to CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-wrapped-2023): style queries, scroll-driven animations, and trigonometric functions, to name a few. 

I hadn&amp;#39;t even completely caught up with the intricacies of Grid Layouting, when [subgrid and container queries](https://web.dev/blog/state-of-css-2022) were shipped. Several of the newly added properties handle cases so specific that I hardly believe I would ever use them ([hanging-punctuation](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/27/the-hanging-punctuation-property-in-css) and [font-palette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-palette), for example). 

Here&amp;#39;s more: there are at least three properties related to [hyphenating paragraphs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphenate-character). You might have used the `filter` property, but did you know that it supports an entirely different class of [filters using SVG](https://stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/svgs-filters-can-be-inlined-in-css/)? Or that you can tweak the [image scaling algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering)? Or `border-radius` support [elliptical corners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)?

The complexity can be gauged by the fact that there were at least [25 units in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units). And with container queries, six more were added. Now, imagine being aware of all those units, how to use them, and more importantly, the best time to use them.

There was a time when I wanted to catch up with everything CSS had to offer, but soon enough, I realized the enormity of my ambition—and also, how largely unnecessary it would be.

## Not Knowing CSS is Okay

CSS is complex for a reason. Its objective is to provide solutions for a wide range of use-cases—from a simple document to dynamic interactive websites. I might never need to bother with how a paragraph is hyphenated, but for news websites, it could be pretty important. 

The trouble stems from feeling the compulsion to know the whole of CSS. Hardcore enthusiasts like [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/) have probably achieved the feat, but the rest of us need to be content with not knowing a large chunk of the language—a desirable constraint, I would argue.

Because, ultimately, CSS is a toolkit. It&amp;#39;s meant to provide tools and solutions for many situations, but not everything is needed at once. You might be proficient with some of the tools, reasonably well with some others, and completely ignorant of the rest. And that&amp;#39;s okay!

If you stumble upon the problem that a CSS feature solves, you will likely learn that feature along the way. And even if you don&amp;#39;t, it&amp;#39;s okay to solve a problem inefficiently, until you stumble upon a better idea in the future. Trust me, you will!

You don&amp;#39;t need to use container queries until you feel the pinch of the problem. You don&amp;#39;t need to know all the [funky ways](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) CSS grid can be utilized. You don&amp;#39;t need to feel bad about not knowing how an impressive [CSS demo](https://a.singlediv.com/) works. 

In short, you don&amp;#39;t need to be overwhelmed with CSS. Everyone feels a bit lost when it comes to the language—from juniors to [seniors](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19021719), but this is mostly from the expectation of knowing everything.

CSS is hard and in my experience, best learned by practically experiencing problems and deeply understanding the solutions. It&amp;#39;s good to be vaguely aware of new additions, but you don&amp;#39;t need to start using them right away. Learn them at your own pace; you&amp;#39;ll do fine.

      <title>The most useful programming language</title>
      <link>https://thoughtspile.github.io/2024/01/09/top-languages/</link>
      <description>Aspiring developers often ask me what&amp;#39;s the best programming language to learn. Personally, I mostly work with JS — solid choice, but everyone and their dog learns JS these days, so it might be time to add some diversity. I&amp;#39;m curious — which single programming language covers the most bases for you, and gives you most career opportunities for years to come? That&amp;#39;s the question we&amp;#39;ll try to answer today.</description>
