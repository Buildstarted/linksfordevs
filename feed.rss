      <link>https://www.pheelicks.com/posts/build-new-zealand-in-an-afternoon/</link>
      <description>This post is a walk-through of how to create an interactive 3D map of anywhere in the world. We will focus on New Zealand, but the same approach could be applied to anywhere.
When we’re done we’ll have simple app that lets us explore the beautiful national parks of New Zealand. You don’t need any knowledge of 3D rendering, just a basic understanding of how to build a website.
The plan We will be needing several components to build this:</description>

      <title>Thoughts on CentOS Stream</title>
      <link>https://jperrin.org/blog/thoughts-on-stream/</link>
      <description>I’m excited to see the CentOS project and Red Hat work together and collaborate around CentOS Stream, and I’d like to explain why I think this is a good move. I’ve been a member of the CentOS project for the last 16 years, and in that time I’ve had countless conversations with developers who were targeting enterprise deployments, but who wanted to push things just a little beyond what was currently available. In my early days with the project it was “I just need this new feature from PHP” or “I need this one option enabled in postfix”. This was so common it spawned an entire cottage industry of 3rd party repositories like Elrepo, IUS, nux-desktop, and even our own CentOSPlus. Often these were features Red Hat would include in a future version of RHEL, but the timing and communication around these features was a mystery. Red Hat never announced release dates or upcoming features and for many developers, even for those internal to Red Hat this was a PROBLEM.</description>

      <title>Running Playwright on Azure Functions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/running-playwright-on-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This post is about Running Playwright on Azure Functions and deploying it to Azure. Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. Since it is a Node.js library I am creating this azure function in Javascript. This function will read a URL as input parameter and converts that URL into a PDF file. So first I am creating an Azure function with Javascript.</description>

      <description>The CLR System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader namespace contains classes for parsing classic ETL events. You create an Event&amp;#173;Log&amp;#173;Reader object, giving it the path to the ETL file, and then call Read&amp;#173;Event to extract the next event from the event log. Here’s a simple program that parses an event log looking for start and stop events from a specific provider and event ID,</description>
