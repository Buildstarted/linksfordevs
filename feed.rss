      <description>The problem of product managers is not that they exist but rather that they have too much power. We have all seen these articles written by developers that explain that product managers are useless. They miss the point. I think it is pretty obvious that PMs (whether you call them …</description>

      <title>What is Mini FM?</title>
      <link>https://anarchy.translocal.jp/radio/micro/what_is_minifm/index.html</link>
      <description>1.  beginnings
There were many motivations to start Mini FM, but as a matter of  fact, Mini FM started in my seminar to cheer up my students who were isolated each other in the period between the collapse of students movement and the beginning of economic leap in the early 80s. They need some medium to re-connect them together individualistic and collective, not lumping them together. Mini FM created a comfortable (safer) distance between them. This was very important in that period just after the inside fights in politics. And then they started Radio Home Run their own radio station in a bohemian center of Tokyo.</description>

      <title>What to expect from your framework</title>
      <link>https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2023/02/17/what-to-expect-from-your-framework/</link>
      <description>There’s been a bit of a brouhaha these last weeks as parts of the Internet suddenly woke up to the realization that most Single Page Apps are slow and overcomplicated, and — shock horror — it turns out that Facebook, the lovable scamps that brought us React and QAnon, have conducted themselves badly! Refreshingly, rather than launching a thousand caustic subtweets, this little stormwind has caused the blog posts to start flying again. Thank you, Elon “Vain gobshite” Musk. I’m totally here for it.</description>

      <title>Writing confidently with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://zknill.io/posts/writing-confidently-with-chatgpt/</link>
      <description>An AI language model As an AI language model designed to mimic human conversation, ChatGPT has encountered its fair share of criticisms. One of the most common criticisms is that ChatGPT can be overly confident in its responses. This perception arises from the fact that people often expect ChatGPT to be an all-knowing oracle that has an answer to every question. As a result, ChatGPT is sometimes judged harshly when it provides a confidently incorrect response.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s kind of sad to find an old piece of code but after running it didn&amp;#39;t give
    the same result as the original one.
    Most of my creative coding is CSS-based and rendered in the browser.
    Browsers and hardware change overtime,
    I realized that those works of mine are only viewable for a certain period of time.</description>
