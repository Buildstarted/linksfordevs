      <title>Introduction &amp; Table of Contents</title>
      <link>https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/</link>
      <description>The goal of Explanations is to try to allow people to play with fun parts of computers. Graphics,
            compression, audio. The tagline is my biggest inspiration: "Play, don't show", riffing off the
            typical "Show, don't tell" rule of writers and authors everywhere. Why bother giving a diagram when
            I give you an inspector and let you poke at things yourself!</description>
