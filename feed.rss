      <title>CoffeeGeek - Baratza Sette 30 Grinder</title>
      <link>http://www.coffeegeek.com/proreviews/quickshot/baratzasette30/details</link>
      <description>In the spring of 2017, Baratza had an identity crisis with their latest grinder venture, the Sette 30 grinder. It was introduced at SCA's Annual Trade Show with the intent of being marketed as a state of the art, fast and capable pourover and drip grinder. The idea was, take away most of the nifty portafilter stuff and the ritzy and unique Acaia scale that the Sette 270Wi had, simplify the interface, use more plastic while still having the same interior bits of the 270 lineup, and sell it for under $250.</description>
