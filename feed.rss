      <description>Have you ever noticed that gradients tend to look a little gray and washed-out in the middle? This happens because of a mathematical quirk with RGB colors. Fortunately, we can work around this quirk, and create beautiful, lush, saturated gradients.</description>

      <description>Well, it is, sometimes. It depends. I often get pushback on MediatR for using service location for resolving handlers, often getting pointed at Mark Seemann&amp;#39;s post that Service Locator is an Anti-Pattern.

      <description>As it stands, the answer to this question is going to remain largely subjective. If you have invested in Web3 (whatever it may turn out to be), you&amp;#39;re more than likely advocate that it is not. Whereas people who see no real-world application for Web3 are mostly going to say it is a scam.</description>

      <description>Reuben Harris and Monte Davidoff spent time disassembling Bill Gates’s original Altair BASIC. In an interview with The Register, Harris was impressed with the code, noting with some admiration, “I found a jump instruction that jumped to the middle of another instruction.”&amp;#185; You can find the targets of those jumps in the error handling code: Search for “Three common errors.”</description>

      <title>Rachit Nigam | PhD Candidate, Cornell University</title>
      <link>https://rachitnigam.com/post/personal-infrastructure/</link>
      <description>Personal infrastructure loosely refers to all the tools and systems I have to
interact on a regular basis to do my job as a PhD researcher.
As a systems researcher, this includes obvious stuff like command-line tools
and programming workflow as well as as the set of tools to build websites,
write papers, manage TODO lists, and record videos.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Introduction to PID controllers&amp;#182;</title>
      <link>https://vanhunteradams.com/PID/PID.html</link>
      <description>This document was assembled for students in ECE 4760, who are asked to construct and control a constrained drone like the one described below. I used the RP2040 for the demo videos rather than a PIC32 so that I could make use of the VGA screen for visualizations.</description>

      <title>Hang your code out to DRY</title>
      <link>https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2022/01/09/hang-your-code-out-to-dry/</link>
      <description>I recently read an article by Jason Swett where he argues against Sandi Metz’ old chestnut “duplication is better than the wrong abstraction” and it made me feel like I have to articulate why I’m Team Sandi here. I’m sure I’ve used the saying a million times in discussions with colleagues and, as such, I feel personally attacked by Jason’s article and need to defend my honor.</description>

      <title>You Can Build a Skyscraper Anywhere in Davis Right Now</title>
      <link>https://kevin.burke.dev/kevin/skyscrapers-davis-california/</link>
      <description>Right now it&amp;#39;s legal to build a skyscraper anywhere in Davis,
California (a college town outside of Sacramento). Unlimited height,
anywhere in city limits, as long as you promise to dedicate 20% of the
apartments to people with lower incomes. Well, it&amp;#39;s legal in theory, no one
has ever tested it. But you could be the one to test it! And hopefully make a
boatload of money along the way, and help prevent more sprawl into wildfire
zones.</description>

      <description>There is a social contract to Open Source. But who really violates the social contract more: companies or FOSS maintainers?</description>

      <title>Introducing Plonky2 — Polygon | Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.polygon.technology/introducing-plonky2/</link>
      <description>Polygon Zero’s mission is simple: to use zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum to a billion users, without compromising decentralization or security. Achieving this requires fast and efficient proof systems. Today, we’re excited to share Plonky2, a major milestone for zero-knowledge cryptography. Plonky2 is a recursive SNARK that is 100x faster than existing alternatives and natively […]</description>

      <description>After coding in VS Code for over five years, it might seem strange as to why I decided to switch my primary (and honestly only IDE) I had been using up to this point. Here are some of the reasons that helped influence my decision to switch</description>
