      <description>FbCare and ElGr are the only specific references in the code snippet. FB could be many things, but it&amp;#39;s not immediately obvious, and ElGr is chopped to the point of being unrecognizable to anyone who isn&amp;#39;t familiar with the area of interest.</description>

      <title>The tools that power Outlook for iOS</title>
      <link>https://myers.io/2022/04/16/the-tools-that-power-outlook/</link>
      <description>I’ve been responsible for the developer tooling for Outlook iOS for 6 years now. Back when I started, we had just a single Bash script that covered everything we though we needed at the time. Now, we have 30,000+ lines of Python code (including tests I have to admit) that depend directly on 50 Python packages. Most of these packages are ones you might expect such as requests, pylint, or black. However, 13 are our own and shared with others. Of those 13, 9 are open source and available for the general community. A further 3 out of the 50 packages we use are my own creation from outside work. While some are personal, and some were created at work, all the tools listed in this post were created by me.</description>

      <title>An inherent source of correlation in the crypto market</title>
      <link>https://thomasvilhena.com/2022/04/an-inherent-source-of-correlation-in-crypto</link>
      <description>If you follow the crypto market, you may already be familiar with the strong direct correlation between cryptocurrencies prices, native or tokenized. When BTC goes down, pretty much everything goes down with it, and when BTC is up, everything is most likely to go up too. This correlation isn’t exclusive to BTC, impacts on the price of many other cryptocurrencies (such as ETH) also reverberate across a wide range of crypto assets, with different degrees of strength among them.</description>

      <title>Opinionated variable names &amp;#183; Caffeinspiration</title>
      <link>https://alexanderell.is/posts/opinionated-variable-names/</link>
      <description>I think a lot about the human part of code, especially the work our brains do when writing and reading it and interfacing with the computer. Rachelbythebay had a great take on a way to inject some brain-processing into a technical task - when you’re running a command to affect n servers, maybe it would be good to type that number in manually.</description>

      <title>Introducing Azure Load Testing</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/introducing-azure-load-testing/</link>
      <description>This post is about Azure Load Testing - Azure Load Testing is a fully managed Azure service that enables developers and testers to generate high-scale load with custom Apache JMeter scripts and gain actionable insights to catch and fix performance bottlenecks at scale. In this post I will explain how to get create an Azure Load Testing resource and execute it with Azure portal. Azure Load Testing helps us to execute Apache JMeter Tests - I already created one using Apache JMeter - You can checkout this blog post on how to create one.</description>

      <title>mjg59 | The Freedom Phone is not great at privacy</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/59479.html</link>
      <description>The Freedom Phone advertises itself as a &amp;quot;Free speech and privacy first focused phone&amp;quot;. As documented on the features page, it runs ClearOS, an Android-based OS produced by Clear United (or maybe one of the bewildering array of associated companies, we&amp;#39;ll come back to that later). It&amp;#39;s advertised as including Signal, but what&amp;#39;s shipped is not the version available from the Signal website or any official app store - instead it&amp;#39;s this fork called &amp;quot;ClearSignal&amp;quot;.</description>
