      <title>I Wrote My Own Editor</title>
      <link>https://bold-edit.com/wrote-my-own.html</link>
      <description>I used to like vscode. I&amp;#39;ve been using it since it could run and debug C#. Last year, I noticed I frequently hit bugs where I couldn&amp;#39;t type until I switched out and back into the editor with alt-tab. That&amp;#39;s not so bad but it got annoying when I couldn&amp;#39;t build or debug until I restarted the program</description>

      <link>https://credistick.com/why-vc-should-embrace-divergence/</link>
      <description>In the last post, I talked about the hunt for liquidity in VC and the role that transparency has in building a healthy secondary market. To take that further, we should look more carefully at the structure of venture capital, the direction the asset class is moving, and lay out a direction which can address… Continue reading Why venture capital should embrace divergence</description>

      <title>The Real C++ Killers (Not You, Rust)</title>
      <link>https://wordsandbuttons.online/the_real_cpp_killers.html</link>
      <description>All the “C++ killers”, even these which I wholeheartedly love and respect like Rust, Julia, and D, help you write more features with fewer bugs, but they don&amp;#39;t much help when you need to squeeze the very last FLOPS from the hardware you rent. As such, they don’t have a competitive advantage over C++. Or, for that matter, even over each other. Most of them, for instance, Rust, Julia, and Clang even share the same backend. You can’t win a car race if you all share the same car. So, which technologies do hold a competitive advantage over C++ or, speaking generally, all the traditional ahead-of-time compilers?</description>
