      <title>Using DataLoader with NestJS</title>
      <link>https://kasvith.me/posts/using-dataloader-with-nestjs/</link>
      <description>NestJS is a powerful framework to develop server-side applications. With GraphQL support, it is easy to create scalable services easily with NestJS. Dataloader plays a crucial part in developing high perfomance GraphQL services. It eliminates the N+1 problem allowing services to be more responsive. In this small article, we will discuss how I integrated Dataloader into a NestJS application.</description>

      <title>A terrible schema from a clueless programmer</title>
      <link>http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/11/06/sql/</link>
      <description>The first time you encounter something, you&amp;#39;re probably going to make 
some mistakes.  There&amp;#39;s a post going around tonight about how someone 
forgot to put an index on some database thing and wound up doing full 
table scans (or something like that).  The rub is that instead of just 
being slow, it also cost a fair amount of money because this crazy 
vendor system charged by the row or somesuch.  So, by scanning 
the whole table, they touched all of those rows, and oh hey, massive 
amounts of money just set ablaze!</description>

      <title>What is AT&amp;amp;T doing at 1111340002?</title>
      <link>https://scribe.rip/telecom-expert/what-is-at-t-doing-at-1111340002-c418876c212c</link>
      <description>From time to time, an attorney will request cellphone activity records from a mobile operator, and those records will show some text messages to and from strange numbers. There is a good chance that the person who uses the phone never sent or saw these messages. And if this happens in the middle of a legal case where cellphone activity is an issue, the resulting confusion can be a source of doubt and error.</description>
