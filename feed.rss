      <title>REST Constraint #4: Cacheable for Better Performance - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-4-cacheable-for-better-performance/</link>
      <description>The internet is fast—until it’s not. Nobody likes waiting for a sluggish API response, and overloaded servers don’t help either. That’s where caching comes in. RESTful APIs embrace caching to improve performance, reduce server load, and create a smoother user experience. But caching isn’t just about speed—it’s about efficiency. Let’s dive into how REST makes caching an essential part of scalable web applications.</description>

      <title>Laurent Kempé - Model Context Protocol Made Easy: Building an MCP Server in C#</title>
      <link>https://laurentkempe.com/2025/03/22/model-context-protocol-made-easy-building-an-mcp-server-in-csharp/</link>
      <description>In my previous post, I demonstrated how to use C# with Microsoft.Extensions.AI, Ollama, and a nuget package called mcpdotnet to interact with an existing MCP Server. Since then, mcpdotnet has been elevated to become the “official C# SDK for Model Context Protocol servers and clients, maintained by Microsoft”.</description>

      <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/new-uspto-memo-makes-fighting-patent-trolls-even-harder</link>
      <description>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just made a move that will protect bad patents at the expense of everyone else.

      <title>The little book about OS development</title>
      <link>https://littleosbook.github.io/</link>
      <description>This text is a practical guide to writing your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help with the technical details while at the same time not reveal too much with samples and code excerpts. We’ve tried to collect parts of the vast (and often excellent) expanse of material and tutorials available, on the web and otherwise, and add our own insights into the problems we encountered and struggled with.</description>

      <title>Pen and Paper Exercises in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13446</link>
      <description>This is a collection of (mostly) pen-and-paper exercises in machine learning. The exercises are on the following topics: linear algebra, optimisation, directed graphical models, undirected graphical models, expressive power of graphical models, factor graphs and message passing, inference for hidden Markov models, model-based learning (including ICA and unnormalised models), sampling and Monte-Carlo integration, and variational inference.</description>
