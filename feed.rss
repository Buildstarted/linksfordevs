Powderfinger are proud to announce that a Deluxe Edition of Odyssey Number Five will be released on 4th September 2020 - twenty years to the day of the original release. 

10x Platinum, beyond Diamond accreditation; three weeks at #1; 25 weeks in the Top Ten; 6x ARIA awards. Odyssey Number Five was the album that propelled Powderfinger into the stratosphere after the passionate mainstream embrace experienced by Internationalist. It was voted #1 in triple J’s Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time and earned an inclusion in the 100 Best Australian Albums in 2011. 

‘My Kind of Scene’, ‘Like A Dog’, ‘Waiting For The Sun’ and, of course, ‘My Happiness’ and ‘These Days’ became anthems for the time and are some of Powderfinger’s most popular recordings to this day. They laid the foundation for Odyssey Number Five to earn a place in Australian music history as a classic Australian record.

      <description>Django is currently the most commonly used full-stack web framework for Python. It has
been around for a good 15 years, emerging as a winner from a period in which
Python was already mature, but its web development tools were comparatively
much more immature and fragmented.</description>

      <description>A couple years back I built Uber Trip Stat’s (now renamed to RideShare Trip Stats after a C&amp;D from Uber), because I was interested in how much money I had spent on Uber over the last few years. Luckily Uber’s web portal lets you see all your past rides, and it was fairly trivial to reverse the API through Chrome. The Chrome Extension just injects some javascript into the page, makes a few requests to get the entirety of your ride history</description>

      <description>On Aug 4, 2020 I woke up to a slightly different world – I had lost my business as it seemed. Full inbox of reports of my apps not launching (crashing on launch) and after not too long I found out that when I sign into my Apple developer account I can no longer see that I would be enrolled into Apple’s developer program – au contraire – it shows a button for me to enroll, which I tried clicking, but only got a message that I can’t do that.</description>

      <description>Days after announcing the Pixel 4a, Google has quietly discontinued sales of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. The move, noted earlier by The Verge, represents an extremely truncated life cycle for a Google flagship — around half of the 18 months the company continued to sell its two predecessors.

      <description>Germany is planning to ban floodlights from dusk for much of the year as part of its bid to fight a dramatic decline in insect populations, it emerged Wednesday. In a draft law seen by AFP, the country's environment ministry has drawn up a number of new measures to protect insects, ranging from partially outlawing spotlights to increased protection of natural habitats. "Insects play an important role in the ecosystem...but in Germany, their...</description>

      <title>How to Cancel Tasks in C# - Using CancellationTokenSource and CancellationToken</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKc5A3exKBQ</link>
      <description>In this video, I answer the question "How to Cancel Tasks in C# using the CancellationTokenSource and CancellationToken objects?".

Cancelling a Task in C# is pretty straight foreword. There are actually several ways to cancel a Task in C#. The three most common ways to cancel a task are by polling , by registering a callback, and by using the Wait handle.  You can even cancel multiple tokens simultaneously.

In this video, we use the polling approach as that is meant for scenarios in which you have long-running computations that loop or recurse.

The general pattern used to cancel a task is:
- Instantiate a CancellationTokenSource object, which manages and sends cancellation notification to the individual cancellation tokens.
- Pass the token returned by the CancellationTokenSource.Token property to each task or thread that listens for cancellation.
- Provide a mechanism for each task or thread to respond to cancellation.
- Call the CancellationTokenSource.Cancel method to provide notification of cancellation.

It's important to note that you should always call the CancellationTokenSource.Dispose method when you have finished using the cancellation token source to free any unmanaged resources it holds.
