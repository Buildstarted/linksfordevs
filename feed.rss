As I stated before developing a dotnet gRPC app right now is an easy feat, but when you try to deploy it in some cloud provider that’s when some wrinkles might appear.</description>

      <description>Four months ago I was still using SpaceVim when I stambled upon a blog post on how to configure NeoVim with Lua. I then started to create my own configuration. In this post I’ll share the learnings acquired in the process. I hope you will find this useful to create your own configuration!
Why create your own Vim config from scratch? Vim has been my daily driver for about ten years.</description>

      <description>This professional development initiative—the first of its kind for the museum—includes mentorship from Dr. Lowery Stokes Sims

BALTIMORE, MD (July 12, 2021) In March 2022, the Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) will present Guarding the Art, an exhibition curated entirely by 17 members of the museum’s security team. The exhibition will draw from works of art in the BMA’s collection, with each work selected by one of the participating officers. As guest curators, the officers will be collaborating with leadership and staff across the museum to select and reinterpret works from a variety of eras, genres, cultures, and mediums—offering a particularly human-centered lens through which to consider the objects. In addition, the team is working with renowned art historian and curator Dr. Lowery Stokes Sims, who is providing additional mentorship and professional development.</description>
