      <description>The traditional wisdom says resting meat keeps it juicy. But when we put that idea to the test, we found a different reason to rest‚Äîone that has nothing to do with juice.</description>

      <title>Predicting Barrel Rate with Fast Swing Rate ‚Äì Running on Numbers</title>
      <link>https://runningonnumbers.com/posts/fast-swings-and-barrels/</link>
      <description>In this article, we will explore the relationship between swing speed and barrel rate in Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Barrel rate is a key metric that measures the percentage of batted balls that are classified as ‚Äúbarrels,‚Äù which are hits with a high probability of resulting in extra-base hits. According to MLB, batted-ball events classified as Barrels had lead to a ‚Äúminium 0.500 batting average and 1.500 slugging percentage‚Äù ‚ÄúStandard Stats  Glossary‚Äù (2025). By understanding how swing speed impacts barrel rate, we can gain insights into player performance and potentially identify areas for improvement. We will use a linear regression model but with an added twist: we will apply a square root transformation to capture non-linear relationships between swing speed and barrel rate. I refer you to my previous article on linear regressions for a refresher on the topic.</description>
