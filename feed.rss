      <title>Ashley Janelle Why You're Not Landing that UX Role [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kFRrzf49-4</link>
      <description>As a UX Coach, the question I am asked the most is "How do I actually land that UX role?". While the question is broad, I've identified a few areas where aspiring UX Designers really struggle getting their foot in the door at companies of their choice. In my talk, attendees will walk away being able to not only identify their key problem areas, but have action items around overcoming those obstacles to land their dream role.

      <title>Let's Encrypt's New Root and Intermediate Certificates</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/09/17/new-root-and-intermediates.html</link>
      <description>On Thursday, September 3rd, 2020, Let’s Encrypt issued six new certificates: one root, four intermediates, and one cross-sign. These new certificates are part of our larger plan to improve privacy on the web, by making ECDSA end-entity certificates widely available, and by making certificates smaller.
Given that we issue 1.5 million certificates every day, what makes these ones special? Why did we issue them? How did we issue them? Let’s answer these questions, and in the process take a tour of how Certificate Authorities think and work.</description>

      <description>Retrieving images from the clipboard with WPF seems so simple, but once you get into it you'll find that there are lots of problems with reliable image retrieval that works for all images. In this post I talk about the different issues you're likely to run into and one hacky  but flexible solution to better image support by selectively sniffing image formats and using different clipboard retrievals based on the image format.</description>

      <title>Azure + Spring Boot = Serverless - Q&amp;A with Julien Dubois </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/azure-spring-boot-serverles-dubois/</link>
      <description>Microsoft seems to prove over and over again its focus on cloud and the Java ecosystem is the new normal. Even though Java is amongst the supported languages for Azure functions for some time now, Julien Dubois experimented with Spring Boot and Azure to see what this combination means for Azure serverless computing. InfoQ reached out to him to explore further his experience on this topic.</description>

      <title>10 Tips for Ramping Up as a Senior Engineer</title>
      <link>https://jdxcode.com/posts/2020-09-16-10-tips-ramping-up-as-a-senior-engineer/</link>
      <description>I've learned the hard way that starting a job on a large engineering team as a senior engineeer is more than simply writing good code. You have to drive initiatives at a social level and not simply because you know more about the codebase.
For a new hire this is especially a challenge. You need to learn the system that your colleagues already understand. You might be a higher level but you'll be a worse engineer for the first few months while you ramp up.</description>

      <description>September 2020. I feel the wet, hardwood floor beneath my fingers. Summer air and water droplets touch my skin. My boots are strapped in and I am ready.
