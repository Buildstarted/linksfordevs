      <title>The Wrong Kind of Readability</title>
      <link>https://thomascothran.tech/2023/11/readability/</link>
      <description>Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas tell us: &amp;#39;it’s critical that you write code that is readable and easy to reason about.&amp;#39; This seems uncontroversial; it is the rare point on which software engineers typically agree. Or do they?</description>

      <title>Investing Behavioral Hacks - The Big Picture</title>
      <link>https://ritholtz.com/2023/11/investing-behavioral-hacks/</link>
      <description>&amp;#160; Markets screamed higher yesterday after a benign CPI report&amp;#160;showed a 0.0% monthly price increase and inflation falling to 3.2% year over year. After a big gap opening, latecomers piled in; many had been sitting on the sidelines following a challenging 2022, while others got panicked out during the 10% October drawdown. It was a…Read More</description>

      <description>One day, as my stomach began churning from spending another 30 seconds of my life waiting for an (incremental) compilation of a change to a single character in a string, I started to recognize a horrible taste developing in my mouth. This Rust programming language I was using promised so much, and was instead, causing me physical pain.</description>

      <title>On pinning and isolating CPU cores</title>
      <link>https://manuel.bernhardt.io/posts/2023-11-16-core-pinning/</link>
      <description>This year I have been involved in running performance benchmarks of Aeron over at Adaptive on two major cloud providers. I learned quite a few things about the arcane arts science craft of running performance benchmarks.
When benchmarking a piece of software, you really want to get the best performance out of it, which is to say that you also want to run it under the best conditions in order to see what is possible.</description>

      <title>Who Took a Bet on You? by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/who-took-a-bet-on-you/</link>
      <description>I can remember at each career inflection point the person who took a bet on me.
When I joined Google it was Kim. When I moved to product, Marissa &amp;amp; Brian. Then to Redpoint, it was the early stage team : Geoff, Tim, Chris, &amp;amp; Scott. Lloyd &amp;amp; Frank at Looker for their Series A. Today, it’s the team &amp;amp; the LPs at Theory.
That’s the very beginning of the list.</description>

      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/hosting-on-azure-don-t-forget-to-declare-utf-8/</link>
      <description>For a long time after moving my website from Netlify to Azure, none of my fancy emoji or weird umlaut characters would display properly. Today I fixed that by popping back into the the Hugo theme I built off of minimum-viable-hugo and adding
&amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt; to themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/index.html and themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/partial/head.html. (There’s probably a way to intimidate Azure Static Web Apps into using UTF-8 by default too, but I didn’t bother to look.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/603/cairos-public-memory/</link>
      <description>Here are some notes on how the Cairo zkVM encodes its (public) memory in the AIR (arithmetization) of the STARK.
If you&amp;#39;d rather watch a 25min video of the article, here it is:

The AIR arithmetization is limited on how it can handle public inputs and outputs, as it only offer boundary constraints.
These boundary constraints can only be used on a few rows, otherwise they&amp;#39;re expensive to compute fo ...</description>

Warning: the following explanation should look surprisingly close to PlonK or SNARKs in general, to anyone familiar with these other schemes. If you know PlonK, maybe you can think of STARKs as turboplonk without preprocessing and without copy constraints/permutation. Just turbo ...</description>
