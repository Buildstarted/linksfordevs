      <link>https://www.strathweb.com/2022/03/running-net-7-apps-on-wasi-on-arm64-mac/</link>
      <description>WASI stands for WebAssembly System Interface, and allows to run WebAssembly code independently of the browsers, as it provides access to operating system features such as file system access or networking. It is highly experimental, but at the same time a tremendously interesting project, and one that has the potential of contributing to a massive paradigm-shift in the industry, making WebAssembly truly ubiquitous.</description>
