      <title>Pin</title>
      <link>https://without.boats/blog/pin/</link>
      <description>The Pin type (and the concept of pinning in general) is a foundational building block on which
the rest of the the Rust async ecosystem stands. Unfortunately, it has also been one of the least
accessible and most misunderstood elements of async Rust. This post is meant to explain what Pin
achieves, how it came to be, and what the current problem with Pin is.</description>

      <title>Multisatellite Data Depicts a Record-Breaking Methane Leak from a Well Blowout</title>
      <link>https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00399</link>
      <description>Accidental blowouts in oil and gas wells can result in large and prolonged methane emissions, which are often unreported when happening in remote places. The rapid advancement of space-based methods for detecting and quantifying methane plumes provides an essential tool for uncovering these superemission events. We use a number of methane-sensitive satellite missions, including the Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI global mapper and several high-resolution instruments, to document a methane leak from a well blowout happening in Kazakhstan’s Karaturun East oil field in 2023. A dense time series of plume detections from those satellites shows that the leak was active during 205 days and that most of the emissions were in the range 20–50 t/h. Using 48 high-quality emission rate estimates, we calculate that a total of 131 &amp;#177; 34 kt of methane was released to the atmosphere during this leak, which exceeds the total emissions from all previously documented accidents. Our study characterizes the evolution and magnitude of the 2023 Karaturun East methane leak and showcases how different types of satellite instruments can be combined to document and quantify methane leaks active during long time periods.</description>

      <description>&amp;#128075;&amp;#127996; This is part of series on concurrency, parallelism and asynchronous programming in Ruby. It’s a deep dive, so it’s divided into 10 main parts:
 Your Ruby programs are always multi-threaded: Part 1 Your Ruby programs are always multi-threaded: Part 2  Consistent, request-local state   Ruby methods are colorless Concurrent, colorless Ruby: Part 1, Threads Concurrent, colorless Ruby: Part 2, Fiber and its MaNy friends Parallel Ruby: Processes, Ractors and alternative runtimes Streaming Ruby: Scaling concurrency Abstracted, concurrent Ruby Closing thoughts, kicking the tires and tangents How I dive into CRuby concurrency  You’re reading “Ruby methods are colorless”.</description>

      <description>Summary

The main idea behind this post is to describe the approach I used to identify the unknow driver&amp;#39;s DriverEntry and its dispatch routines, using the BlackCat driver as an example.


Environment

Tools used during the analysis: Visual Studio 2019 Community, Windows Driver Kit - Windows 10.0.19041.685,</description>

      <title>How to avoid frustration with software architecture</title>
      <link>https://ebellani.github.io/blog/2024/how-to-avoid-frustration-with-software-architecture/</link>
      <description>It is becoming more common for companies to come out with stories on the downsides of distributed microservice architectures1(Kolny 2023; Ghemawat et al. 2023).
Instead of hopping in this bandwagon, as tempting as this might be, I want to suggest how could one avoid being caught in such situation in the first place.
Fundamentally, I think the problem that originated the current dissatisfaction with microservices is a double confusion:
 between the form (modules) and the matter (interacting running processes) of software and(Ainsworth 2024); between the the form (modules) of software and the form of software building organizations (teams, executing environments, deployment pipelines …).</description>
