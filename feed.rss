      <title>Does Baby Have Hat</title>
      <link>https://www.jeremykun.com/2025/04/01/does-baby-have-hat/</link>
      <description>It’s April Cools! Last year I wrote about parenting, in 2023 about friendship bracelets. and in 2022 about cocktails. This year it’s a bit of a meandering stroll through some ideas around mutual aid and self-reliance.
Maternity wards If you walk around the maternity ward at Kaiser Permanente’s Sunnyside medical center outside of Portland, Oregon, you might notice the same two things I did. The first was how many signs were posted on the hallways describing the maternity team’s KRs and displaying charts showing that they are meeting them.</description>

      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2025/03/31/random-numbers-included.html</link>
      <description>I've recently worked on a
PRNG API for TigerBeetle, and made a
surprising discovery! While most APIs work best with half-open intervals,
for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++),
it seems that random numbers really work best with closed intervals, ≤n.</description>

      <title>Script for Updating Open WebUI in a Proxmox LXC</title>
      <link>https://www.lucasaguiar.xyz/posts/script-update-open_webui-lxc/</link>
      <description>A really simple script for those that, for some odd reason, decided to run the Open WebUI server from inside a LXC.
The problem I really like the interface in Proxmox and i prefer it than dealing with Portainer for some services that are more accessed. This is the case for Open WebUI, which I use daily.
The problem I faced was the update process of the service, which I knew little about.</description>

      <link>https://jarbus.net/blog/read-weird-things/</link>
      <description>I used to have a mental block against casually reading things that weren’t designed to be casually read, like old papers, textbooks, documentation, etc. If I was going to read for enjoyment, I’d read blogs or popular science/fiction books. Not sure why.
Over time, I’ve met people who read things I’d never think to read. I’ve gotten a lot of value from copying them, so I’m sharing my thoughts here.</description>

      <description>Some very important news on the future of the show in this episode. You'll get answers to important questions like:

  What does the future of the show look like? Who are the next, big ticket, guests? What's a SegFault? Why does my knee hurt? Why do fools fall in love? Does this look infected to you?  Any many more. So definitely make a point of listening to this episode... all the way to the end, too.

 There's no transcription for this episode, as it's all breaking news and I didn't have the time to get one completed before the time of release.

 Show Notes Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, I'll talk you through a slight change of direction for the show. But more on that in a moment. Let's listen to the intro music for a little longer before I wrap up this intro.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `go mod init github.com/golang-show` and we'll dive into...

 Full Show Notes There are no full show notes for this episode, friends. I'm sorry for that, but it's the nature of the game when you're releasing breaking news.
