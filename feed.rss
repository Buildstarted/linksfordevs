      <title>How I Work From Home And Parent – Geeqs at Seeq</title>
      <link>https://geeq.seeq.com/2022/02/25/how-i-work-from-home-and-parent/</link>
      <description>While it’s become a sore subject for many since the rise of COVID-19 and associated school and daycare closures, working from home with children around has been a part of my life since 2015, when my son was born. As with anything, choosing to do something yields very different results than being forced into it; I thought I would share a little of my experience, what I’ve found to work and not work, and how the flexibility of working for Seeq has enabled me to, at times, combine parenting and working.</description>

      <title>Don’t track bugs, fix them</title>
      <link>https://holub.com/bugs/</link>
      <description>You do not need a bug tracking system. In fact, a bug tracking system is a symptom of a deeper problem—insufficient focus on quality. In general, I fix bugs the moment they appear—not in a drop-everything sense, but as soon as I can get to it—usually within a few hours, but sometimes in a day or two when I’m done with the current story. Of course, if I’m working in the code when I notice a bug, I just fix it right then. The software I write has no known bugs in it as a consequence (and yes, I never</description>

      <description>Asynchronous Trustworthy Transfer (AT2) is a research project developed at
                    Prof. Rachid Guerraoui&amp;#39;s Distributed Computing Lab, at EPFL. It is a new way to transfer assets (such as coins) throughout a network of potentially
                    rogue participants. It is quite close to Bitcoin in its capabilities, while being orders of magnitudes faster and consuming much less energy.</description>
