      <title>Clippy Desktop Assistant</title>
      <link>https://felixrieseberg.github.io/clippy/</link>
      <description>Clippy lets you run a variety of large language models (LLMs)
            locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the
            1990s. It's a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy - and
            the visual design created by Microsoft in that era.</description>
