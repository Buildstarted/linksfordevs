      <title>Is deep learning a new kind of programming? Operationalistic look at programming</title>
      <link>http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/learning-and-programming/</link>
      <description> Making a concept synonymous with the operations for working with it is
an idea introduced by P. W. Bridgman to think about measurements in physics. A length
measured by a ruler is a different concept than a length measured by the time it takes
light to travel. However, what if we thought about programs in the same way? Is a program
constructed manually the same as a program obtained by training a neural network?</description>

      <title>No, engineers don&amp;#39;t suck at time estimates</title>
      <link>https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/no-engineers-dont-suck-at-estimates/</link>
      <description>No, engineers don’t suck at time estimates - and generally speaking humans are better estimators than what most people believe. This seems rather surprising given all we’ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data?</description>

      <description>While Microsoft and community developers have improved desktop dev tooling in .NET 5 and new open source implementations, the tech hasn&amp;#39;t translated easily from the Windows-only .NET Framework, and catch-up efforts planned for next year&amp;#39;s .NET 6 include high DPI support for one troublesome project, Windows Forms.</description>

      <title>Who do we spend time with across our lifetime?</title>
      <link>https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime</link>
      <description>Who we spend time with evolves across our lifetimes. In adolescence we spend the most time with our parents, siblings, and friends; as we enter adulthood we spend more time with our co-workers, partners, and children; and in our later years we spend an increasing amount of time alone. But this doesn’t necessarily mean we are lonely; rather, it helps reveal the complex nature of social connections and their impact on our well-being.</description>

      <title>CS 6120: The Self-Guided Course</title>
      <link>https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/</link>
      <description>CS 6120 is a PhD-level Cornell CS course by Adrian Sampson on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class.</description>
