      <description>Been a lot of &amp;quot;victim blaming&amp;quot; going on these last few days. The victim, through no fault of their own, has been the target of numerous angry tweets designed to ridicule their role in internet security and suggest they are incapable of performing their duty. Here&amp;#39;s where it all started:</description>

      <title>Taming the Tech Giants – jake lazaroff</title>
      <link>https://jake.nyc/words/taming-the-tech-giants/</link>
      <description>Everyone&amp;#39;s angry at the tech industry these days! Tech companies continue to cement their place as some of the most powerful companies in the world, and taking shots at them has become a popular sport. Most recently, Facebook and Twitter suppressed a controversial New York Post article, raising accusations that the social networks are putting their thumbs on the scale of the upcoming election.
    In response, conservatives — led by the President — have set their sights on Section 230, the legislation that protects the right of Internet companies to moderate content. “Repeal Section 230” has become a popular rallying cry from people who believe that large social networks are abusing this ability to enact a political agenda. There’s a lot of rhetoric around “publishers” and “platforms” (the idea being that if you decide to moderate content on your app or website, you should assume legal liability for it) and that Internet companies are breaking the rules by deciding what content to allow.
    Naturally, the left disputes the claim that conservatives are being censored. But we can still analyze the power of gatekeeper platforms even if we disagree about how they&amp;#39;re wielding it.

In this blog, I’ll show that these policies are applied only in client and thus can be easily bypassed.

      <title>ASP NET CORE SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA) Build/Release Pipeline | Azure DevOps</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYhufaLn51w</link>
      <description>Hi Friends,
Welcome to the first-ever live stream that I am doing on this channel, and thank you for supporting me and this channel. 

I will show you how to set up a  Build/Release pipeline in Azure DevOps for an ASP NET Single Page Application (SPA) in this live stream. I will be using the default React SPA template and deploying it to an Azure Web Application. I will show how to set up multiple environments like Dev and Test, and deploy to them.

If you are new to the SPA templates in ASP NET Core, check out the previous video where I walk through the template and how the different parts fit together.

      <title>AMD to Acquire Xilinx</title>
      <link>https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/xilinx-acquisition</link>
      <description>In connection with the proposed transaction, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) intends to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of AMD and Xilinx, Inc.

Each of AMD and Xilinx may also file other relevant documents with the SEC regarding the proposed transaction. This document is not a substitute for the joint proxy statement/prospectus or any other document that AMD or Xilinx may file with the SEC. The definitive joint proxy statement/prospectus (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of AMD and Xilinx. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE OR WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO THESE DOCUMENTS, CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND RELATED MATTERS. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (if and when available) and other documents containing important information about AMD, Xilinx and the proposed transaction, once such documents are filed with the SEC through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. Copies of the documents filed with the SEC by AMD will be available free of charge on AMD’s website at ir.AMD.com or by contacting AMD’s Corporate Secretary by email at Corporate.Secretary@AMD.com. Copies of the documents filed with the SEC by Xilinx will be available free of charge on Xilinx’s website at investor.Xilinx.com or by contacting Xilinx’s Investor Relations department by email at ir@Xilinx.com.</description>

      <title>The BurgerMaster segment may have been legendary, but some legends aren&amp;#39;t true | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201027-00/?p=104399</link>
      <description>Some time ago, I discussed the historical significance of the Burgermaster drive-in restaurant. This triggered a memory from one of my colleagues: I also heard that the BurgerMaster was identified by an ordinal value, and that ordinal value was the telephone number of the restaurant.</description>

      <title>Using Blazor JavaScript Isolation with Library Manager</title>
      <link>http://www.engstromjimmy.se/2020-10-15-IsolatedJS</link>
      <description>One of the new features in .NET 5 for Blazor is isolated JavaScript.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
It means that you can have JavaScript that is only for a specific component.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
It is also a fantastic way for component developers to include JavaScript into their libraries so the developers using their library will not have to add the JavaScript themselves.</description>

      <title>Diving into /proc/pid/mem</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/diving-into-proc-pid-mem/</link>
      <description>A few months ago, after reading about Cloudflare doubling its intern class, I quickly dusted off my CV and applied for an internship. Long story short: now, a couple of months later, I found myself staring at Linux kernel code and adding a pretty cool feature to gVisor.</description>
