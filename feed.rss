      <description>&amp;quot;What started as a prototype in 2017 has become one of the hottest technologies in the .NET ecosystem. Blazor is Microsoft’s new front-end framework for building single page applications using C#, not JavaScript. That’s right, C# running in your browser. No plugins, transpilation or voodoo magic involved - just web standards.</description>

      <title>The Feynman Lectures on Physics Audio Collection</title>
      <link>https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/flptapes.html</link>
      <description>These are the tape recordings of Richard Feynman&amp;#39;s 1961-64 Caltech Introductory Physics lectures, which form the basis of the book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The original recordings were made on 1/4&amp;quot; reel-to-reel tapes, now preserved in Caltech&amp;#39;s Archive. In 2010 the entire collection was digitized by media preservationist George Blood, at a sampling rate of 96 kHz with 24-bit samples, PCM-encoded in tiff files about 2 GB each in size. For this online publication we are serving more compact versions, downsampled to 48 kHz with 16-bit samples, reencoded as AAC-HE (mp4) and Opus (ogg) at a data rate of 48 kbps.</description>

      <title>Your iPhone (and iCloud backups) are full of gigabytes-worth of old iMessages that are virtually impossible to read – Key Discussions</title>
      <link>https://keydiscussions.com/2021/05/28/apple-charges-for-storing-gigabytes-worth-of-old-imessages-you-cant-reliably-access/</link>
      <description>Many iPhone owners have iMessages from years ago that they can’t access. For example, my wife and I simply want to read the first few messages that we exchanged in 2017, but we can’t. A friend of mine recently had to prove she had a relationship with someone for US immigration services, and she was able to quickly do this by downloading an easily searchable file containing all messages without using a 3rd-party tool. But she doesn’t use iMessage, she uses another chat app.</description>
