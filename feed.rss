      <title>What Does Culturally Responsive Teaching Mean in an Online Environment? [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9__M7a8wHM</link>
      <description>Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) is an instructional approach that seeks to ensure academic success while developing students' sense of culture and social-political awareness. CRT allows students to see themselves in the curriculum and assignments provided by the teacher. In the online and traditional classroom, CRT provides opportunities for students to learn how to value their culture. During this time in America, it is especially important for students to have opportunities to express themselves while using online technology.

      <description>In a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ll celebrate my fifth year as a professional - understand paid - software engineer. I find this role to be a right balance of technical skills, human relationships and it fulfils my curiosity. As time goes by, I&amp;rsquo;m also starting to be disappointed by some of its negative aspects. While it doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from sleeping, I think an effort could be made to challenge some lousy and short-sighted comments we see daily on social platforms.</description>

      <description>We restreamed a direct feed of the Facebook Connect presentation offered by John Carmack at 5:30PM PT on Sept. 16, 2020. 

Don't forget to read our full review of the Oculus Quest 2 right here: https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-2-review/

00:00:00 John Carmack starts talking
00:03:03 “Global lockdown and pandemic..."
00:04:35 “Frankly I’m kind of embarrassed by our social story here…”
00:05:12 “Location-based VR has probably taken a terminal hit…”
00:06:00  "People are ok with making a sweaty mess in their own personal  headset..”
00:12:07 “Reality...just seamlessly flows into the simulation...”
00:14:06 “Quest 2 is better, faster, cheaper, and we’re making a ton more of them..."
00:14:54 “"Resolution is 3664x1920...”
00:16:33 “You could start doing some real work with it..."
00:18:34 “Best display that we’ve ever had..."
00:31:29 “Still haven’t announced a full wireless connection system for Link...we should have some kind of an Air Link”
00:32:47 Qualcomm XR2
00:59:12 “Whatever the next headset is we’ve got to get higher resolution on the tracking cameras.”
