      <title>Stop Conflating CQRS and MediatR</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/stop-conflating-cqrs-and-mediatr</link>
      <description>The .NET ecosystem has gradually fused CQRS and MediatR together, creating a reflexive assumption that they&amp;#39;re inseparable, but this mental shortcut has led teams down a path of unnecessary complexity. This article dispels common misconceptions by explaining how CQRS and MediatR are distinct tools solving different problems, and demonstrates how to implement CQRS effectively with or without MediatR.</description>

      <description>For the past six years, I’ve been trying to integrate React and ProseMirror, the popular rich text editing library. I’ve finally published @handlewithcare/react-prosemirror, which includes complete rewrite of ProseMirror’s rendering engine in React. Here’s a very deep dive into the journey I took, and why it led me where it did!</description>

      <title>How to do well in a technical interview | Radu Ghitescu</title>
      <link>https://ghitescu.com/articles/how-to-do-well-in-a-technical-interview/</link>
      <description>Over the past 7 years I&amp;#39;ve sat across virtual and physical tables from many software engineers, from bright-eyed juniors to battle-tested veterans with decades of experience under their belts. Today, I want to speak directly to you, the job seeker, and suggest how you can increase your chances of securing a technical role. Of course, this assessment is through my own lens and my advice may not help you in any situation, but as usual you should use your best judgement.</description>
