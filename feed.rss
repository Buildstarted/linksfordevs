      <title>Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02113</link>
      <description>Deep neural networks are often seen as different from other model classes by defying conventional notions of generalization. Popular examples of anomalous generalization behaviour include benign overfitting, double descent, and the success of overparametrization. We argue that these phenomena are not distinct to neural networks, or particularly mysterious. Moreover, this generalization behaviour can be intuitively understood, and rigorously characterized using long-standing generalization frameworks such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds. We present soft inductive biases as a key unifying principle in explaining these phenomena: rather than restricting the hypothesis space to avoid overfitting, embrace a flexible hypothesis space, with a soft preference for simpler solutions that are consistent with the data. This principle can be encoded in many model classes, and thus deep learning is not as mysterious or different from other model classes as it might seem. However, we also highlight how deep learning is relatively distinct in other ways, such as its ability for representation learning, phenomena such as mode connectivity, and its relative universality.</description>

      <title>Building self improving negotiation agents – aunhumano</title>
      <link>https://aunhumano.com/index.php/2025/03/16/building-self-improving-negotiation-agents/</link>
      <description>I’ve been eager for a long time to work on a project where LLMs negotiate with each other, to see if prompt changes can improve the negotiators. I hadn’t been able to find much time to work on the project, but thanks to Cursor and Claude Sonnet, I was able to make progress. Basically, the entire project was carried out using that assisted coding tool—I hardly touched any code, and my role was mostly to communicate to Claude what I was looking to build.</description>

      <description>When building systems to detect cyberattacks or fraud, technical expertise alone isn’t enough. Success hinges on adopting a detection mindset—a way of thinking that prioritizes skepticism, rapid iteration, and rigorous validation. A detection mindset ensures that detection engineers and data scientists remain vigilant, adaptive, and results-driven in their approach. Here’s...</description>

If you work for a company that builds primarily consumer software1, there are, hopefully, three groups of humans who believe they are accountable for the product. They are:


Engineering. They build the product.
Design. No, they build the product.</description>

      <title>LLM crawlers continue to DDoS SourceHut</title>

      <description>SourceHut continues to face disruptions due to aggressive LLM crawlers.
We are continuously working to deploy mitigations. We have deployed a number of
mitigations which are keeping the problem contained for now. However, some of
our mitigations may impact end-users.
In particular, we have deployed Nepenthes to certain routes which are
associated with large volumes of LLM-related traffic. You may encounter certain
pages which are not usable as a result, especially if you are not logged in.</description>

      <description>REST isn’t just a set of suggestions—it’s built on a strict set of architectural principles that make it scalable, flexible, and resilient. These six constraints define what makes an API truly RESTful and ensure it can handle anything from simple web apps to large-scale distributed systems. Let’s break them down and see why they matter.</description>

      <title>TypeScript-Go: A 10x Faster TypeScript without .NET but in Go</title>

      <description>Recent news came out that Microsoft is working on a new TypeScript compiler written in Go (or golang - whatever you prfer). It promises to be 10x faster than the current compiler that is written - well in TypeScript itself. While this is certainly good news, why isn&amp;#39;t Microsoft betting on .NET and C#?
