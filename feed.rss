      <description>The world is a very malleable place. When I read biographies, early lives leap out the most. Leonardo da Vinci was a studio apprentice to Verrocchio at 14. Walt Disney took on a number of jobs, chiefly delivering papers, from 11 years old. Vladimir Nabokov published his first book (a collection of poems) at 16, while still in school.

      <title>Tip 322 - How to perform opinion mining with Azure Cognitive Services</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip322.html</link>
      <description>The Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics API (opens new window) provides the sentiment analysis feature. You can use this to analyze if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. And to get a more advanced analysis, you can use the opinion mining feature of sentiment analysis (opens new window), which analyzes a sentence on a deeper level and can identify multiple different sentiments in a sentence. For instance, the sentence &amp;quot;I love spicy food, but I hate how it makes me feel&amp;quot;, is both positive and negative. Opinion mining can detect those sentiments.</description>

      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/07/01/c-sharp-9-azure-functions-in-process/</link>
      <description>C# 9 has some amazing features. Azure Functions are have two modes: isolated and in-process. Whilst isolated supports .NET 5 (and hence C# 9), in-process supports .NET Core 3.1 (C# 8). This post shows how we can use C# 9 with in-process Azure Functions running on .NET Core 3.1.</description>

      <title>Move fast, but understand the problem first</title>
      <link>https://jacobobryant.com/blog/understand/</link>
      <description>Startup founders need to do two things: (1) figure out what to do, (2) do it.
(I suppose that applies to anyone, but I&amp;#39;m writing about founders). My beef
with &amp;quot;move fast&amp;quot; is that I don&amp;#39;t naturally associate it with figuring out what
to do. To me, &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; is physical, outward, observable. Shipping features and
talking to people... but not thinking. If I spent a day thinking, trying to
better understand a problem, I wouldn&amp;#39;t view myself as having &amp;quot;moved fast&amp;quot; that
day. And that&amp;#39;s a real shame, at least if &amp;quot;good founders move fast&amp;quot; is true.</description>

      <title>Branches: No assembly required</title>
      <link>https://niedzejkob.p4.team/bootstrap/asmless/</link>
      <description>Last time, we started from the barebones Miniforth kernel, and
implemented branches by writing additional primitive words in assembly. For
pragmatic reasons, that is the road I will be pursuing further, but I noticed
that it is also possible to implement branches in pure Forth. I believe that
this approach is quite interesting, so let&amp;#39;s take a detour and get a closer
look. </description>

It has the following metrics: Page views per day, Unique IP addresses per day Views per page per day. Motivation Google Analytics Google Analytics felt like overkill. It has so many data-points that the useful metrics are obscured. I also like this site to load quickly and GA makes it slower. CloudFlare Analytics I’ve also tried CloudFlare Analytics. It’s a lot simpler than GA and better suits my use... </description>

      <link>https://andrewhenke.com/bash-aliases-to-make-your-life-easier/</link>
      <description>I spend a lot of time working on the bash command line, and I’ve come to highly value the availability of my custom set of shortcuts, preferences, and tricks, right at my fingertips. You know, all the stuff that lives in .bashrc, .profile, .vimrc, .git, etc. As such, I decided to compile and publish a list of my favorite bash aliases and tools.</description>

      <title>A Journey into Mathematical Logic: Diophantus of Alexandria</title>
      <link>https://hegz.me/posts/diophantus/</link>
      <description>Introduction In this series of blog posts, I will be discussing some of my favorite topics in math, It mostly falls under the domains of mathematical logic and computability theory.
Diophantus of Alexandria Diophantus was a Greek mathematician that flourished around 250 AD, he is most famous for his book “Arithmetica” in which he had compiled 130 algebraic problems among thirteen books where most of their solutions were positive integers, and that’s why mathematicians call such algebraic equations as “Diophantine Equations”.</description>

      <title>Why I created scrt.link - a tool to share sensitive information online</title>
      <link>https://blog.stophe.com/why-i-created-scrtlink?guid=none</link>
      <description>It all started with the idea to send private messages (in a fun way). Messages that don&amp;#39;t persist. Think Snapchat, but without giving away your user data.

      <description>I’ve been thinking about small things that can have a disproportionately large impact. For example, buying options against potential Black Swans. The cost of an option for an unlikely event occurring is generally small but if it happens, the upside can be huge. Conversely, you can have the opposite happen.
