      <title>Tracking Every Change: Using SaveChanges Interception for EF Core Auditing - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/tracking-every-change-using-savechanges-interception-for-ef-core-auditing/</link>
      <description>Ever wonder who changed what and when in your database? Or maybe you’ve had that “uh-oh” moment where data was updated, but no one knows how? Good news: EF Core has a built-in way to track changes—without modifying every query manually! SaveChanges Interception lets you hook into EF Core’s SaveChanges() pipeline and log inserts, updates, and deletes automatically.</description>

Here is a quick before and after:
(Router and modem are upstairs. I have cable that runs directly to the switch here.)

      <title>DeepSeek-R1&amp;#39;s strong zero-shot performance on agentic tasks</title>
      <link>http://krasserm.github.io/2025/02/05/deepseek-r1-agent/</link>
      <description>I ran a quick experiment investigating how DeepSeek-R1 performs on agentic tasks, despite not supporting tool use natively, and I was quite impressed by preliminary results. This experiment runs DeepSeek-R1 in a single-agent setup, where the model not only plans the actions but also formulates the actions as executable Python code. On a subset1 of the GAIA validation split, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 12.5% absolute, from 53.1% to 65.6% correct, and other models by an even larger margin:</description>
