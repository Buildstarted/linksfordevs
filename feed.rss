      <title>Augmenting the client with Vue.js</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/ajax-ssr/3/</link>
      <description>In my previous post, I laid the ground to build upon; now is the time to start &amp;#39;for real&amp;#39;.   I heard a lot of Vue.js. Additionally, a friend who transitioned from developer to manager told me good things about Vue, which further piqued my interest. I decided to have a look at it: it will be the first &amp;#39;lightweight&amp;#39; JavaScript framework I’ll study - from the point of view of a newbie, which I am.   Laying out the work   I explained WebJars and Thymeleaf in the last post. Here’s the setu</description>

      <link>https://cybernetist.com/2024/09/23/some-notes-on-adversarial-attacks-on-llms/</link>
      <description>Intro Last week I was catching up with one of my best mates after a long while. He is a well-recognised industry expert who also runs a successful cybersecurity consultancy. Though we had a lot of other things to catch up on, inevitably, our conversation led to AI, LLMs and their (cyber)security implications.
I’ve spent the last couple of months working for early-stage startups building LLM (Large Language Model) apps, as well as hacking on various silly side projects which involved interacting with LLMs in one way or another.</description>

      <title>How to fork: Best practices and guide</title>
      <link>https://joaquimrocha.com/2024/09/22/how-to-fork/</link>
      <description>Fork maintenance — keeping your changes in sync with the latest updates from the original project — can quickly become a mess. Trust me. Over the years, my work did sometimes involve maintaining forks of various open-source projects. That’s not the case with my job now, but when a colleague reached out for help with a fork that hadn’t been rebased in ages, it got me thinking that the steps I follow might be useful for other developers too. Hence this article.</description>

      <description>It feels like every single web service wants to use OAuth to get user data, and for good reason too. The alternatives include requiring users to create access tokens manually (yikes) and asking users to input their usernames/passwords to impersonate them (giga yikes). At least with OAuth, users get to see a pretty screen with a big “Approve” button.</description>

      <title>A simple way to deal with the principal threat to scalability</title>

      <description>If you have a distributed system one of the main worries you probably have is scalability. Well, what is the principal threat to scalability in such systems is the conflict between transactions that are used to guarantee correct results in concurrent operations.
Such conflicts are dealt with by concurrency control, either pessimistically via something like exclusive resource lock or optimistically via something like serializable snapshot isolation.
Let me illustrate the threat with from the pessimistic point of view:</description>

      <title>Use keyed services in ASP.NET Core | BinaryIntellect Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/9a08452a-8ee5-4d6b-adde-26908b8ba69b.aspx</link>
      <description>A few years ago I wrote an article describing how ASP.NET Core DI container behaves when multiple implementations of an interface are registered. It&amp;#39;s time to revisit the concept because .NET 8 has something better to offer -- Keyed Services. I am going to use the same example that I used in the earlier article. We will modify the example for .NET 8.</description>

      <title>It is hard to recommend Google Cloud</title>
      <link>https://ashishb.net/programming/google-cloud/</link>
      <description>Google Domains A year back, I had to migrate my domain after Google decided to shut down Google Domains. I had to, not only, painfully setup multiple side-projects sub-domain mappings again on a new domain registrar but also re-verify my domain and re-create those mappings on Google Cloud Run.
Google Container Registry Google Container Registry is shutting down in 2025. It has been replaced with a new project called Artifact Registry.</description>
