      <title>Stop Conflating CQRS and MediatR</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/stop-conflating-cqrs-and-mediatr</link>
      <description>The .NET ecosystem has gradually fused CQRS and MediatR together, creating a reflexive assumption that they&amp;#39;re inseparable, but this mental shortcut has led teams down a path of unnecessary complexity. This article dispels common misconceptions by explaining how CQRS and MediatR are distinct tools solving different problems, and demonstrates how to implement CQRS effectively with or without MediatR.</description>

      <description>For the past six years, I’ve been trying to integrate React and ProseMirror, the popular rich text editing library. I’ve finally published @handlewithcare/react-prosemirror, which includes complete rewrite of ProseMirror’s rendering engine in React. Here’s a very deep dive into the journey I took, and why it led me where it did!</description>

      <description>Over the past 7 years I&amp;#39;ve sat across virtual and physical tables from many software engineers, from bright-eyed juniors to battle-tested veterans with decades of experience under their belts. Today, I want to speak directly to you, the job seeker, and suggest how you can increase your chances of securing a technical role. Of course, this assessment is through my own lens and my advice may not help you in any situation, but as usual you should use your best judgement.</description>

      <title>Stanford Lecture - Strong Components and Weak Components, Dr. Donald Knuth I 2024</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Hi8r_63LGyg</link>
      <description>The 28th annual Christmas lecture
Thursday, December 5, 2024

A directed graph can often be best understood and used if we partition its vertices into separate components of various kinds. Most important are the strongly connected components, called “strong components” for short; and strong components are in turn partitioned into “weak components.”

Two definitions of weak components have appeared in the literature of graph theory. One of them is rather weak and uninteresting, while the other is becoming more and more relevant and appreciated (see weak components revived). Basically, the strong components are the smallest clusters of vertices that you can shrink to a point and obtain a dag, a digraph with no oriented cycles. The weak components, correctly defined, are the smallest clusters that you can shrink to a point and obtain an oriented path.

Dr. Knuth will discuss Robert Tarjan&amp;#39;s beautiful algorithms for computing the strong and weak components of a given directed graph. (This will be fun because Dr. Knuth&amp;#39;s personal favorite, among all of the algorithms of all kinds that he has encountered so far in his life, is Tarjan&amp;#39;s method for discovering the strong components as it explores the graph.)

Furthermore, if time permits, Dr. Knuth disclose the answer to the following riddle: In what major world city are shirts of size XL smaller than shirts of size L?

      <title>Grokking Application Security: Malcolm McDonald on Securing Your Apps</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=vnU7yNzHNPY</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;This should be a mantra for anyone working on web applications or web APIs: you should validate any input of the application as much as possible. When you conceptualize it, all the malicious input into your application comes across in an HTTP request at some point. It&amp;#39;s either in the URL or in the body. That&amp;#39;s generally speaking, unless you have a supply chain attack, that&amp;#39;s generally the vector by which your application will be attacked. Before you even start to kind of think about specific vulnerabilities, if you narrow down what is permissible input right out of the gate, then you kind of close the door on so many different vulnerabilities without even thinking about it.&amp;quot;— Malcolm McDonald

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie &amp;quot;GaProgMan&amp;quot; Taylor.

 In this episode, Malcolm McDonald joined us to talk about the importance of Application Security, knowing the basics of secure coding, and backing that all up with both &amp;quot;secure by default&amp;quot; designs, and subscribing to CVE notifications.

 &amp;quot;So what you find in your career is that if you set down kind of sensible default behaviour in your codebase earlier on, then everyone will follow that. You establish, kind of, best practices. It might take a little bit longer, but if you say, &amp;quot;this is the way we do this over here,&amp;quot; then even yourself when you, kind of, come back to, will kind of, reproduce that path. So the initial, kind of, like first few check-ins to your source control are key to, like, establishing best practice&amp;quot;— Malcolm McDonald

 One note before we begin: some of Malcolm&amp;#39;s audio is a little rough. Mark, our superstar editor, has done what he can, but there are parts that might be a little unclear. If you have trouble with the audio, please remember that there is a full transcription linked in the accompanying show notes.

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.
