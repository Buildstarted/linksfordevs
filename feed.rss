      <description>This is a follow up on a previous post
about how to host multiple isolated ASP.NET core applications in a single
process with with a single http listener/entry. The techniques used in that post
used types and classes e.g.
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Internal.StartupLoader that have been made
internal in ASP.NET Core 3.x and thus the approach is no longer viable.</description>

      <title>The physiological effects of slow breathing in the healthy human</title>
      <link>https://breathe.ersjournals.com/content/13/4/298</link>
      <description>Slow breathing practices have been adopted in the modern world across the globe due to their claimed health benefits. This has piqued the interest of researchers and clinicians who have initiated investigations into the physiological (and psychological) effects of slow breathing techniques and attempted to uncover the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of normal respiratory physiology and the documented physiological effects of slow breathing techniques according to research in healthy humans. The review focuses on the physiological implications to the respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiorespiratory and autonomic nervous systems, with particular focus on diaphragm activity, ventilation efficiency, haemodynamics, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory coupling, respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sympathovagal balance. The review ends with a brief discussion of the potential clinical implications of slow breathing techniques. This is a topic that warrants further research, understanding and discussion.

Key points 

Educational aims 

Slow breathing techniques have been used in asthma but are there effects in healthy individuals? &amp;lt;http://ow.ly/gCPO30eQOPZ&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>If you have the handle to a volume, you can issue certain disk ioctls to the volume, and it will forward them to the underlying disk. We saw this earlier when we used IOCTL_STORAGE_GET_DEVICE_NUMBER to obtain the physical drive number from a volume.</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 8: Abstract Classes, Interfaces and Error Handling</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj3GJTUaIaQ</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s take a step into object oriented design and listen to Fritz explain abstract classes and interfaces.  We&amp;#39;ll use our newfound knowledge to write error handling and exceptions in our code.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:12:10 - How do you make a new instance of a new generic object?
00:20:34 - Do abstract classes require at least one abstract method?
00:51:58 - Do you have a real world example of implementing interface default implementations?
01:19:37 - When should you throw an exception and when do you return an unsuccessful status?
01:22:01 - Basically Minecraft server uses this type of try / catch block for handling connection errors?

      <description>Uninterrupted, good quality mobile phone reception is extremely important to rail passengers. In technical terms, it’s the pi&amp;#232;ce de r&amp;#233;sistance for every network provider because the demands on bandwidth increase with data-intensive applications. Swisscom has now successfully achieved a transmission speed of over 1 Gigabit per second on a moving train under test conditions. This result sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry.</description>

      <description>The trolley problem asks how to decide between the lives of people in two groups. At the moment, it comes up in our industry in discussions around self-driving cars: Suppose a car gets into a situation where it must risk injuring either its passengers or pedestrians; which ones should it prioritize saving?</description>

      <title>Is Software Contracting For You? - Mischa Spiegelmock</title>
      <link>https://spiegelmock.com/2020/10/20/is-software-contracting-for-you/</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re a full-time employee, becoming a contractor means giving up some job security. You may not have a guaranteed paycheck for a while, if ever. Being a contractor, especially if you&amp;#39;re starting out and doing it alone, brings many uncertainties. However working as a full-time employee carries its own sort of risks. Job security isn&amp;#39;t what it used to be, spending time on bureaucracy and pleasing your superiors may not make you fulfilled, and there&amp;#39;s a real limit to how much you can accomplish for yourself as part of a larger organization.  There is comfort in working at a company; all you have to do is show up and be told what to do, you don&amp;#39;t have to think much about taxes or contracts, someone else can make a lot of the decisions about how to run the company. But if you want to take on more responsibility, have the opportunity to grow and learn to run your own business, and do things your way then consider becoming a contractor. Almost everyone I know who works for a company of any size will be happy to tell you all about the mistakes and boneheaded ideas of their superiors. Everyone has ideas of how the company they work for could be run better. I say if you really believe this then work for yourself.</description>
