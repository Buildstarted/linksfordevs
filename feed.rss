      <title>Speeding up ELF relocations for store-based systems</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2024/05/03/speeding-up-elf-relocations-for-store-based-systems.html</link>
      <description>Since the introduction of Nix and similar store-based systems such as Guix or Spack, I have been fascinated about finding improvements that take advantage of the new paradigms they introduce. Linux distributions are traditionally dynamic in nature, with shared libraries and executables being linked at runtime. Store-based systems, however, are static in nature, with all dependencies being resolved at build time. This determinism allows for not only reproducibility but also the ability to optimize various aspects of our toolchain. Work that I’ve have written previously about shows that there are worthwhile speedups that can be gained. While previously, I focused on improving the stat storm that occurs when resolving dependencies, I have recently been looking at speeding up the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program. You can check out my publication Mapping Out the HPC Dependency Chaos about the development of shrinkwrap if you are interested in the topic. Extending the idea further, I have been looking at how we can optimize the ELF relocations that occur when executing a program. In this post, I will discuss the basics of ELF relocations and symbol resolution and how we can optimize these processes for store-based systems.</description>

      <title>Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong and consistent predictor of morbidity and mortality among adults: an overview of meta-analyses representing over 20.9 million observations from 199 unique cohort studies</title>
      <link>https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/58/10/556</link>
      <description>Objective To examine and summarise evidence from meta-analyses of cohort studies that evaluated the predictive associations between baseline cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and health outcomes among adults.

Design Overview of systematic reviews.

Data source Five bibliographic databases were searched from January 2002 to March 2024.

Results From the 9062 papers identified, we included 26 systematic reviews. We found eight meta-analyses that described five unique mortality outcomes among general populations. CRF had the largest risk reduction for all-cause mortality when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.47; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.56). A dose–response relationship for every 1-metabolic equivalent of task (MET) higher level of CRF was associated with a 11%–17% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR=0.89; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.92, and HR=0.83; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.88). For incident outcomes, nine meta-analyses described 12 unique outcomes. CRF was associated with the largest risk reduction in incident heart failure when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.31; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.49). A dose–response relationship for every 1-MET higher level of CRF was associated with a 18% reduction in heart failure (HR=0.82; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.84). Among those living with chronic conditions, nine meta-analyses described four unique outcomes in nine patient groups. CRF was associated with the largest risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality among those living with cardiovascular disease when comparing high versus low CRF (HR=0.27; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.48). The certainty of the evidence across all studies ranged from very low-to-moderate according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations.

Conclusion We found consistent evidence that high CRF is strongly associated with lower risk for a variety of mortality and incident chronic conditions in general and clinical populations.
