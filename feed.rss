      <title>An example of overengineering - keep it WET</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/example-overengineering/</link>
      <description>This week’s post is pretty short. I’ve already written about overengineering, but this adds a personal touch. I had to rewrite my Jet Train demo to use another data provider, switching from a Swiss one to a Bay Area one. One of the main components of the demo is a streaming pipeline. The pipeline: Reads data from a web endpointTransforms data through several stepsWrites the final data into an in-memory data grid Most of the transform steps in #2 enrich the data. Each of them requi</description>

      <title>Rage bug reporting : ezyang’s blog</title>
      <link>http://blog.ezyang.com/2021/04/rage-bug-reporting/</link>
      <description>At Facebook, we have an internal convention for tooling called &amp;quot;rage&amp;quot;. When something goes wrong and you want to report a bug, the tool developer will typically ask you to give them a rage. For a command line tool, this can be done by running a rage subcommand, which will ask about which previous CLI invocation you&amp;#39;d like to report, and then giving you a bundle of logs to send to the developer.</description>

      <title>How to setup nginx reverse proxy for aspnet core apps with Docker compose</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-nginx-reverse-proxy-with-docker-compose/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about configuring nginx reverse proxy for aspnet core apps with Docker compose. Today I took as session on Introduction to Docker Containers one of the question I received was how to run multiple instances of a container and load balance them. So in this blog post I am creating multiple instances of a ASP.NET Core Web API and load balance them with the help of nginx. Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.</description>
