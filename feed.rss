      <title>Folklore.org: -2000 Lines Of Code</title>
      <link>https://www.folklore.org/Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.html</link>
      <description>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</description>

I've completed quite a few certifications in the past‚Äîstarting with entry-level ones and moving into some offensive security-specific certs‚Äîbut this was going to be the first that covered what would become a recurring phrase over the next few months: the "Common Body of Knowledge" of cybersecurity.I knew a few people who had already passed the CISSP, and I</description>

      <description>The advent of cluely and the ever growing arms race between the interviewer and the interviewee is a fascinating phenomenon to me. Betting that people would prefer cheating or that companies needed screen for cheaters because the use of LLMs is heavily discourage seems to go against the common experience that LLMs do accelerate or improve the productivity of developers overall (with caveats of course).</description>

      <description>Motivation
    I‚Äôm a very insecure guy.
In fact, that was first real feedback that I received from a manager (now a dear friend), ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exceptionally good in your tasks, but damn, you‚Äôre too insecure about yourself‚Äù,
this trait got in my way in a various situations like defending a technical decision to other devs. This was last year, since it a lot of stuff happened:
I joined a Bitcoin developer launchpad where I had the opportunity to meet extremely talented people; started to learn Rust and contribute to Open Source; got
the second place
in a hackathon; did a talk in the greatest cybersecurity event of Latin America; started to do english classes with an amazing teacher, and, started to work at Turso as Open Source contributor in project Limbo.</description>
