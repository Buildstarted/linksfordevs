      <title>Preventing iOS Textbox Auto Zooming and ViewPort Sizing</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Apr/17/Preventing-iOS-Safari-Textbox-Zooming</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;ve build mobile Web applications that need to run on iOS Safari and on an iPhone you might have run into the problem of input fields &amp;#39;auto-zooming&amp;#39; the display when the input field and popup keyboard get focus. The view zooms and doesn&amp;#39;t return back to the unzoomed even after exiting the input field. In this post I describe why this happens in some scenarios, and a couple of ways you can work around this annoying iOS Web browser behavior.</description>

      <title>mjg59 | Booting modern Intel CPUs</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/66109.html</link>
      <description>CPUs can&amp;#39;t do anything without being told what to do, which leaves the obvious problem of how do you tell a CPU to do something in the first place. On many CPUs this is handled in the form of a reset vector - an address the CPU is hardcoded to start reading instructions from when power is applied. The address the reset vector points to will typically be some form of ROM or flash that can be read by the CPU even if no other hardware has been configured yet. This allows the system vendor to ship code that will be executed immediately after poweron, configuring the rest of the hardware and eventually getting the system into a state where it can run user-supplied code.</description>

      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/cda93276-c9ab-42c3-8288-a9b3e5c8aa5c</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about Contravariance and Covariance in C# using .NET Framework examples!
Contravariance and covariance are essential concepts in C# when dealing with generics, enabling us to have more flexibility when assigning generic types. So let&amp;#39;s have examples straight from the framework itself!
Also, we will go a bit deeper and talk what some differences between generic constraints and things like Contravariance are.
