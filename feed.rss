      <title>75 Cents per Month by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/the-cost-of-her/</link>
      <description>What it cost to have an assistant with you like in the movie Her?
The cost of using AI has dropped precipitously, an order of magnitude every year.
If the average American picks up their phone 144 times per day &amp;amp; engages with an assistant, each time for four interactions every day of a month, an assistant like Her would cost about 78 cents in inference cost.1
I’m not taking into account any of the additional costs associated with delivering such a product.</description>

      <title>QK Norm and the Curious Case of Logit Drift</title>
      <link>https://rossjtaylor.com/blog/2024-11-03-qk-norm.html</link>
      <description>Multimodality has led to some tweaks to the standard Transformer recipe. In this post we will cover QK Normalization (QKNorm), 
            where we apply normalization to the query and key vectors in the attention mechanism. This has become an important step for unified input 
            models where we have tokenized representations of text, images and other modalities present in a single sequence. These types of models are very prone to training instability without appropriate normalization, as the norms of the Q and K vectors can experience exponential growth during training. QKNorm is a necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) step to correct this problem.</description>

      <title>Packing group membership data into an integer - Emir&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2024-11-20-data-in-integers/</link>
      <description>Say you have a large number of items, each of which could belong to multiple
groups, and you’d like to assign to each item an integer which is able
to encode its group memberships. The number of items could be vast, but say the
number of groups is fairly small – less than a few hundred – and each item
could be a member of many groups (say &amp;lt;= 5).</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago I discovered three issues that allow one to bypass app lock in Ente Auth. The issues I found aren&amp;#39;t technically interesting and don&amp;#39;t really deserve a blog post, but since Ente appears to be hesitant to notify their users about them, off we go.</description>

      <title>Burnout In Software Engineers: How To Get OUT Of It</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=bLWTf2YfUPk</link>
      <description>Burnout is something we don&amp;#39;t talk about enough in software engineering.

One of the scariest parts about burnout:

It can sneak up on you. You don&amp;#39;t realize it until it&amp;#39;s too late.

Typically, when I talk about burnout, it&amp;#39;s mostly about identifying and preventing it. However, in this video, we&amp;#39;ll take a bit of a spin on the topic as we look at overcoming burnout once you&amp;#39;re already experiencing it.

      <title>Let’s Encrypt: Delivering SSL/TLS Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2014/11/18/announcing-lets-encrypt/</link>
      <description>Vital personal and business information flows over the Internet more frequently than ever, and we don&amp;amp;rsquo;t always know when it&amp;amp;rsquo;s happening. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s clear at this point that encrypting is something all of us should be doing. Then why don’t we use TLS (the successor to SSL) everywhere? Every browser in every device supports it. Every server in every data center supports it. Why don’t we just flip the switch?
The challenge is server certificates.</description>
