      <title>Generics for Go</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/824716/ee9bbbfad58cef3d/</link>
      <description>The Go programming language was first released
in 2009, with its 1.0 release made in March 2012. Even before the 1.0 release,
some developers criticized the language as being too simplistic, partly due
to its lack of user-defined generic
types and functions parameterized by type. Despite this omission, Go is 
widely used, with an estimated 1-2 million
developers worldwide. Over the years there have been several proposals to
add some form of generics to the language, but the recent
proposal written by core developers Ian Lance Taylor and Robert
Griesemer looks likely to be included in a future version of Go.</description>

      <description>'If you look at what people actually do to be happier, it seems nearly everyone tries to change the external facts: we try to become richer, thinner, more successful, to find a better house in a nicer area, and so on. A few of us think about trying to spend less time working, and more time on hobbies or with friends and family. Almost no one thinks about actively retraining the way they think. In fact, I don’t think this last idea even crosses most of our minds.'</description>

      <title>The illusion of statelessness</title>

      <description>Some libraries, frameworks, components, and architectures either encourage statelessness, or make it a requirement. While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit. State in Functional Programming Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are pure functions: A pure function is a function that has the following properties: Its return </description>

This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</description>

      <title>What accomplishments sound like on software engineering resumes</title>
      <link>https://jacobian.org/2020/may/8/engineering-resume-accomplishments/</link>
      <description>Effective resumes need to contain two things: responsibilities and accomplishments. The first tells the read what your job was; the second, what your results were. Unfortunately, most people fail at the second part. I’ve seen thousands — maybe tens of thousands — of resumes, and most don’t contain accomplishments. This makes it difficult for a hiring manager to get excited about your resume: knowing what you were supposed to do doesn’t tell a reader how well you did that thing.</description>

      <title>Linear scalable read-write lock</title>
      <link>https://blog.the-pans.com/shared-mutex/</link>
      <description>The basic concept of a read-write lock is simple. It allows multiple readers to
access the resource simultaneously, but at most one thread can have exclusive
ownership of the lock (a.k.a write lock). It's supposed to be an optimization,
comparing to simple mutex (e.g. std::mutex). As in theory, multiple readers do
not contend. Naively, read performance should scale linearly. However, this is
not the case in practice for most read-write locks, due to cacheline
pingpong-ing.
