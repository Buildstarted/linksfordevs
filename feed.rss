      <description>Perhaps you’re in a line of work where security is a must, or a hard-core Linux enthusiast, or perhaps you’ve just got enough of Android and iOS and you’re ready for something else – the PinePhone may be the next Phone for you. Powered by the same Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit SOC used in our popular PINE A64 Single Board Computer, the PinePhone runs mainline Linux as well as anything else you’ll get it to run.</description>

      <title>An alternative to ConfigureAwait(false) everywhere</title>
      <link>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/benwilli/an-alternative-to-configureawaitfalse-everywhere</link>
      <description>One of the general recommendations you may often read is to use ConfigureAwait(false) in library code. This is so that when the library is used, it does not block the synchronization context in use by the application (e.g. the UI thread). If the library doesn’t know anything about the app, it doesn’t depend on the application’s context and doesn’t need to run within it. This makes sense but it ends up truly meaning that you have to put ConfigureAwait(false) on every async call in your entire library. To me, that seems ...excessive.</description>

10x Platinum, beyond Diamond accreditation; three weeks at #1; 25 weeks in the Top Ten; 6x ARIA awards. Odyssey Number Five was the album that propelled Powderfinger into the stratosphere after the passionate mainstream embrace experienced by Internationalist. It was voted #1 in triple J’s Hottest 100 Australian Albums of All Time and earned an inclusion in the 100 Best Australian Albums in 2011. 

‘My Kind of Scene’, ‘Like A Dog’, ‘Waiting For The Sun’ and, of course, ‘My Happiness’ and ‘These Days’ became anthems for the time and are some of Powderfinger’s most popular recordings to this day. They laid the foundation for Odyssey Number Five to earn a place in Australian music history as a classic Australian record.

      <description>Back when I was into competitive gaming, I accidentally stumbled onto a strategy to consistently get my teams into the top 25 of the worldwide gaming ladders. I call the approach "Chaining Wins", the approach held even when we started playing newer versions of those competitive games. The strategy's genesis</description>

      <title>Surviving Django (if you care about databases) — Daniele Varrazzo</title>
      <link>https://www.varrazzo.com/blog/2020/07/25/surviving-django/</link>
      <description>Django is currently the most commonly used full-stack web framework for Python. It has
been around for a good 15 years, emerging as a winner from a period in which
Python was already mature, but its web development tools were comparatively
much more immature and fragmented.</description>

      <title>Reversing Lyft’s ride history API to analyze 6 years worth of rides</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/reversing-lyft</link>
      <description>A couple years back I built Uber Trip Stat’s (now renamed to RideShare Trip Stats after a C&amp;D from Uber), because I was interested in how much money I had spent on Uber over the last few years. Luckily Uber’s web portal lets you see all your past rides, and it was fairly trivial to reverse the API through Chrome. The Chrome Extension just injects some javascript into the page, makes a few requests to get the entirety of your ride history</description>

      <title>A Day Without Business – Charlie Monroe</title>
      <link>https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/</link>
      <description>On Aug 4, 2020 I woke up to a slightly different world – I had lost my business as it seemed. Full inbox of reports of my apps not launching (crashing on launch) and after not too long I found out that when I sign into my Apple developer account I can no longer see that I would be enrolled into Apple’s developer program – au contraire – it shows a button for me to enroll, which I tried clicking, but only got a message that I can’t do that.</description>

      <description>Days after announcing the Pixel 4a, Google has quietly discontinued sales of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. The move, noted earlier by The Verge, represents an extremely truncated life cycle for a Google flagship — around half of the 18 months the company continued to sell its two predecessors.
