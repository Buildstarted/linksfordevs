      <title>Using Reinforcement Learning in the Algorithmic Trading Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11523</link>
      <description>The development of reinforced learning methods has extended application to
many areas including algorithmic trading. In this paper trading on the stock
exchange is interpreted into a game with a Markov property consisting of
states, actions, and rewards. A system for trading the fixed volume of a
financial instrument is proposed and experimentally tested; this is based on
the asynchronous advantage actor-critic method with the use of several neural
network architectures. The application of recurrent layers in this approach is
investigated. The experiments were performed on real anonymized data. The best
architecture demonstrated a trading strategy for the RTS Index futures
(MOEX:RTSI) with a profitability of 66% per annum accounting for commission.

      <title>Demystifying Memory Profilers in C# .NET Part 2 - Memory Leaks</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/memory-profilers-for-memory-leaks/</link>
      <description>Memory leaks are very common, hard to notice, and eventually, lead to devastating consequences. The main tool to detect and fix memory leaks is a Memory Profiler. In fact, I believe the most common usage of memory profilers in .NET is exactly for the purpose of fixing memory leaks. In this article, you'll see exactly how to use memory profilers to find the leaky objects, why they are still referenced, and how to solve the problem.</description>

      <title>DevExpress Reports: Localization with Azure Text Translator API</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4gkCl5eOA</link>
      <description>If you’ve watched our first Report Localization-video, you know that v20.1 – set to ship in May 2020 – allows you and your end-users to quickly translate individual reports for global distribution.  In this video, we’ll describe a v20.1 feature we did not have time to document in our first video – Specifically, we’ll describe how you can use Azure Text Translation API and your own custom localization service within the DevExpress Web End-User Report Designer.

      <title>I could do that in a weekend!</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/</link>
      <description>I can't think of a single large software company that doesn't regularly draw internet comments of the form “What do all the employees do? I could build their product myself.” Benjamin Pollack and Jeff Atwood called out people who do that with Stack Overflow. But Stack Overflow is relatively obviously lean, so the general response is something like “oh, sure maybe Stack Overflow is lean, but FooCorp must really be bloated”. And since most people have relatively little visibility into FooCorp, for any given value of FooCorp, that sounds like a plausible statement. After all, what product could possible require hundreds, or even thousands of engineers?</description>

      <title>INotifyPropertyChanged with C# 9.0 Source Generators</title>
      <link>https://jaylee.org/archive/2020/04/29/notify-property-changed-with-rosyln-generators.html</link>
      <description>In a design meeting far, far away, source generators were designed to be part of C# 6.0, but sadly never came to be. At the time, wanting that source generation feature pretty badly, I went on implementing the specification which later became Uno.SourceGeneration, and it turns out it was the right decision to stick with a very similar API.

I could port the INotifyPropertyChanged (INPC) generator I built a while back that uses Uno.SourceGeneration package, convert it to use Roslyn’s shiny new C# 9.0 feature in a matter of minutes. Amazing!

      <description>We’re pleased to introduce the first preview of Source Generators, a new C# compiler feature that lets C# developers inspect user code and generate new C# source files that can be added to a compilation. This is done via a new kind of component that we’re calling a Source Generator.</description>

      <title>To Microservices and Back Again - Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/</link>
      <description>When Segment moved to a microservices architecture, they gained environmental isolation, but at a cost of higher operational overhead. Three years later, the costs were too high, and the team migrated back to a monolith. At QCon London, Alexandra Noonan told the cautionary tale, and emphasized the importance of evaluating trade-offs in architectural decisions.</description>
