      <title>Stupid Things Orgs Do That Kill Productivity w/ Netflix, FloSports &amp;amp; Refactoring.club</title>
      <link>https://devinterrupted.substack.com/p/stupid-things-orgs-do-that-kill-productivity</link>
      <description>From the archives: As we progress through Season 3, we thought it would be nice to look back at some of our best episodes that haven’t been posted to our Substack page. Enjoy! At LinearB, we like to think we spend all our time figuring out how to unlock developer potential. To find ways to let devs do more of the work they love and reduce the amount of time they spend dealing with needless hurdles, idling and churn.</description>

      <description>Ok I&amp;#39;ve been at this for the past several hours, I&amp;#39;ve tried everything and at this stage I don&amp;#39;t know what to do next.

      <title>Introducing Kotlin/Wasm</title>
      <link>https://seb.deleuze.fr/introducing-kotlin-wasm/</link>
      <description>This blog post is a refined transcription of the presentation Zalim Bashorov and I gave at Wasm I/O 2023 to introduce Kotlin/Wasm. I will later add a video of the recording when available.
Zalim Hi, everyone! I’m Zalim. I’m writing Kotlin in Kotlin at JetBrains and leading Kotlin/Wasm. We are going to have a quick journey around Kotlin/Wasm, we will see what the possibilities are, and also have a look at the inside.</description>

      <title>The age of average — Alex Murrell</title>
      <link>https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average</link>
      <description>In the early 1990s, two Russian artists named Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid hired a market research firm to survey the public on what they wanted in a work of art. Across 11 countries they then set about painting a piece that reflected the results. Each piece was intended to be a unique a colla</description>

      <description>Airbnb is worse than a casino addiction. It’s a sucker’s bet. It’s rigged. The house almost always wins. Everybody knows this. And yet, we all still tempt fate, itching for that once-in-a-lifetime, deal-of-the-century, jackpot experience that we’ll never forget.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Logs for Fun and Profit</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/harvesting_logs_for_fun_and_profit/</link>
      <description>From a security point of view, application logs are two-sided. On the one hand, it is really important to have good observability, to find out what is happening and what has happened. On the other hand, we don’t want to leak sensitive information. In this post I am going to look at the kinds of things you might find in your logs. The juicy bits are Personal Identifying Information (PII) or security credentials.</description>

      <title>Agile Is A Glass Cannon</title>
      <link>https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/software-processes/agile-is-a-glass-cannon/</link>
      <description>A recent shower thought of mine is that agile software development
might be similar to the strategic concept of a glass
cannon in gaming —
specifically, that it’s a high-risk high-reward strategy where the risk can be
mitigated by skill/experience.</description>

      <title>Fast Unix Commands</title>
      <link>https://alexsaveau.dev/blog/projects/performance/files/fuc/fast-unix-commands</link>
      <description>Fast Unix Commands (FUC) is a project that aims to create the world’s fastest Unix commands. Currently, this means rm and cp replacements named rmz and cpz (the ‘z’ stands for “zippy”). When better performance cannot be achieved, the next highest priority is efficiency. In practice, rmz appears to be the fastest file deleter available while cpz wins in most cases, only losing in flat directory hierarchies.</description>
