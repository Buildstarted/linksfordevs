      <description>When I was a teenager, I spent my entire free time playing video games. Mostly League of Legends but also Call of Duty, Age of Empires, or Minecraft. This wasn’t a casual hobby. It was an obsession. I would come home from school, toss my backpack into the corner, boot up my computer, and play — often late into the night. School […]</description>

      <title>The Blueprint For A Modern Day LLM</title>
      <link>https://nofone.io/llm-blueprint</link>
      <description>Modern day LLMs stack started from a Transformer architecture, most refined &amp; revolutionized by the attention mechanism as provided in 'Attention is All You Need'. The basic idea is that you can avoid using compute heavy models like RNNs by creating Query, Key, Value matrices that represent different relationships between tokens (i.e., 'words') Since then, there has been a ton of advancement and research into how to develop capabilities like chat-like responses, reasoning, long-context, etc.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, Beijing-based Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2, an open source model that rivaled the coding capabilities of larger, closed models. It’s a really impressive model (though it’s coding capabilities have since been overshadowed by Qwen 3 Coder), especially since it’s cheaper to run than Claude 3.5 Haiku.</description>

      <description>In the field of cybersecurity, a distinction is made between the "blue team" task of building a secure system, and the "red team" task of locating vulnerabilities in such systems.  The blue team is more obviously necessary to create the desired product; but the red team is just as essential, given the damage that can result from deploying insecure systems.

The nature of these teams mirror each other; mathematicians would call them "dual".  The output of a blue team is only as strong as its weakest link: a security system that consists of a strong component and a weak component (e.g., a house with a securely locked door, but an open window) will be insecure (and in fact worse, because the strong component may convey a false sense of security).  Dually, the contributions to a red team can often be additive: a red team report that contains both a serious vulnerability and a more trivial one is more useful than a report that only contains the serious issue, as it is valuable to have the blue team address both vulnerabilities. (But excessive low-quality reports can dilute attention from critical issues.) 

Because of this, unreliable contributors may be more useful in the "red team" side of a project than the "blue team" side, though the blue team can still accommodate such contributors provided that the red team is competent enough to catch almost all of the errors that the contributor to the blue team might make.  Also, unreliable red team contributions only add value if they _augment_ the output of more reliable members of that team, rather than _replace_ that output, and if their output can be effectively filtered or triaged by more experienced red team members.
