      <title>Comptime: Scott Redig</title>
      <link>https://www.scottredig.com/blog/bonkers_comptime/</link>
      <description>Programming has obvious abilities to increase productivity through automated manipulation of data.  Metaprogramming allows code to be treated as data, turning programming’s power back onto itself.  Programming close to the metal has perhaps the most to gain from metaprogramming as high level concepts need to be mapped precisely to low level operations.  Yet outside of functional languages I’ve always found the metaprogramming story to be a disappointment.  So when I saw that Zig lists metaprogramming as a major feature, I took interest.</description>

When developers reach for Redis as a messaging solution, they typically gravitate toward its Pub/Sub capabilities. While Pub/Sub excels at broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers, it falls short for reliable work distribution scenarios. Messages are transient - any offline</description>

The job/housing/dating markets are demoralizing, the institutions are terrible, and the people are kind of deranged.

      <title>What Makes a Good Automated Test?</title>
      <link>https://etodd.io/2025/01/06/what-makes-a-good-automated-test/</link>
      <description>When I started at StrongDM five years ago (woah), we had zero automated tests. Last year we had 50,000 tests. Today, around 70% of our code is covered by over 100,000 tests, most of which run on every pull request.
What follows is my personal opinion about what constitutes a “good” automated test based on my observation of this colossal increase in test coverage. The goal is not to convince you I’m right, but to draw some contrasts and provoke you to question assumptions and form your own opinions.</description>

      <title>S. Partarrieu | A year for action and intentionality</title>
      <link>https://sebpartarrieu.com/blog/2025/the-year-ahead/</link>
      <description>As a child, my favorite bedtime story was David and Goliath. I would ask for it every night, and I must have heard it hundreds of times. Yet, it continuously struck a chord with small Sebastian who, as the youngest of 4, felt like the underdog in many situations. David’s courage gave me hope, and a deep belief that despite being the youngest and smallest (at the time) of the family, I could still do great things.</description>

      <title>Dive into Time-Series Anomaly Detection: A Decade Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20512</link>
      <description>Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising volume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time series analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.</description>

      <title>Routing and Topologies – Navigating the Digital Highways - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/routing-and-topologies-navigating-the-digital-highways/</link>
      <description>When you send an email, stream a video, or check a social media feed, it&amp;#39;s easy to take how that data travels to you for granted. Behind the scenes, an intricate system of routing and network topologies ensures that everything arrives where it&amp;#39;s supposed to—fast and error-free. Let&amp;#39;s pull back the curtain and take a closer look at how data navigates the digital highways and the role that topologies play in shaping those pathways.</description>
