      <title>.NET Rocks! Understand Web Apps using Fiddler with Sam Basu and Rosen Vladimirov</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1840</link>
      <description>Do you know what your web app is up to? Carl and Richard talk to Sam Basu and Rosen Vladimirov about the latest versions of Fiddler. The original Fiddler for Windows is a free tool, but the Progress team has written all new products in the Fiddler space that are cross-platform and designed to work with different groups of people. Fiddler is for developers, first and foremost, letting you see the messages passing between the browser (or other clients) and the server in HTTP and HTTPS. With the new products, you can also connect to SignalR and gRPC data! Then there are tools for tech support and even embedding capabilities into your applications.</description>

      <description>It was my third year of university (2017), and one of my friends told me about how it’s possible to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from some app. He doubled his investments in the last couple of weeks and made his uncle invest some amount, who called him and thanked him for the recommendation. The spark was already kindled.   The infamous scene from the Bollywood movie Phir Hera Pheri.</description>

      <description>In 2021, I quit my job at Honeycomb to set out on my own and try to build a company. At first, I wasn’t sure the exact model I’d follow, and had a (perhaps too lofty) aspiration that maybe I’d have a hybrid model, doing a bit of consulting, a bit of real estate, and a bit of product/SaaS/4-hour-workweek livin’ the dream. And, of course, if I happened to hit on something big, I could go raise venture and pursue that.</description>

      <link>https://blog.timkaechele.me/2023/04/05/naming-is-everything.html</link>
      <description>Naming things is important, not only when programming, but also in the real world.
How you name something shapes how you think about it, and by extension limits it.
A well known real world instance where you can experience the power of names first hand is law making.
Think about it, what sounds better:</description>

      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/must-have-programming-tools/</link>
      <description>Forget programs. The most important productivity tool for programming is your mind. And the next best set of software development tools are ones that take care of you.
It isn’t about Git. Or Docker. Or testing frameworks. These are all useful tools. I use them daily. But they are not the most important software development tools.
Your wellbeing is, in fact, the most important factor in your ability to write good software.</description>

      <title>Impersonation-as-a-Service: Characterizing the Emerging Criminal Infrastructure for User Impersonation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04344</link>
      <description>In this paper we provide evidence of an emerging criminal infrastructure
enabling impersonation attacks at scale. Impersonation-as-a-Service (ImpaaS)
allows attackers to systematically collect and enforce user profiles
(consisting of user credentials, cookies, device and behavioural fingerprints,
and other metadata) to circumvent risk-based authentication system and
effectively bypass multi-factor authentication mechanisms. We present the
ImpaaS model and evaluate its implementation by analysing the operation of a
large, invite-only, Russian ImpaaS platform providing user profiles for more
than $260&amp;#39;000$ Internet users worldwide. Our findings suggest that the ImpaaS
model is growing, and provides the mechanisms needed to systematically evade
authentication controls across multiple platforms, while providing attackers
with a reliable, up-to-date, and semi-automated environment enabling target
selection and user impersonation against Internet users as scale.</description>
