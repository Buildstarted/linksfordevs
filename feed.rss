      <title>No PM, no problem: how we ship great products fast</title>
      <link>http://www.spencerfry.com/no-pm-no-problem-how-we-ship-great-products-fast</link>
      <description>Many things surprise people about how differently we work at Podia, but one that comes up often is that we have absolutely zero product/project managers at our company of more than 30 people. Despite this — though I’ll argue below that it’s precisely because of this — we’re shipping features faster than companies many times our size and resources.</description>

      <title>Granting at least once delivery</title>
      <link>https://tuwukee.github.io/ruby/fibers/2023/02/14/granting-at-least-once.html</link>
      <description>Exactly-once is the message delivery guarantee the most developers want to achieve in their systems. In the most cases, the implementation of the set of rules backing it up should include the application layer. When it comes to messaging systems, exactly-once delivery at an app level is much easier to be built on top of at-least-once, since at-most-once sometimes loses messages.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Pharo Smalltalk Plugin</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebastiansastre.co/article/how-to-create-a-pharo-smalltalk-plugin</link>
      <description>When working with Smalltalk, you may wish to access functionality that exists in a specific library or technology that you do not want to recreate. In such cases, you have two options: creating an FFI bridge or extending the Smalltalk VM with new primitives. In this article, we&amp;#39;ll explore the less common method of extending the Pharo Virtual Machine with an external plugin by creating a HelloWorldPlugin. The goal is to provide insight and clarity into the process of extending the VM in this manner, and to explain the steps involved in Pharo 9 as of February 2023.</description>

      <title>How I Decreased ETL Cost by Leveraging the Apache Arrow Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://rcpassos.me/post/apache-arrow-future-of-data-engineering</link>
      <description>In the field of Data Engineering, the Apache Spark framework is one of the most known and powerful ways to extract and process data.
It is well-trusted, and it is also very simple to use once you get the infrastructure set up.
Understandably, most engineers will choose it for every task.
However, in a lot of ways, it can be overkill. And a very expensive one.</description>

      <description>I’m a professional computer programmer, but I don’t often do all that much computer programming. Instead I spend much of my time futzing around with config files, other people’s frameworks, and other people. This makes it easy to forget how much fun it is to write a long program that truly interests you and watch it do something a little bit astonishing.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to Nostr &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/nostr/</link>
      <description>“A milestone for open protocols…” This is how Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, announced the arrival of the Damus app, a Nostr protocol client, in the App Store/iOS.
Nostr has generated buzz in developer groups, bitcoin addicts, and a crowd very suspicious of their own shadows. The reason: Nostr brings an alternative to commercial social media that, in the words of its creators, would be “truly censorship-resistant”.</description>

      <title>Improving EF Core performance with Compiled Queries</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/improve-ef-core-performance-with-compiled-queries/</link>
      <description>This post is about improving EF Core performance with Compiled queries. From EF Core 2.0 onwards, EF Core supports compiled queries, which helps developers to compile the queries in advance and executed when application executes the query. By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate.</description>

C# relies on object-oriented, imperative principles, and F# relies on functional principles.&amp;#160; Some developers are using F# as a complement to C#, rather than relying on the functional capabilities that exist natively in C#.</description>

      <description>Last year, we brought a new feature to improve the way you assess target framework compatibility of a NuGet package through a new “Frameworks” tab. Today, we are announcing a new feature that will allow you to search by a target framework on NuGet.org.</description>

      <title>Whatever happened to Elm, anyway?</title>
      <link>https://derw.substack.com/p/whatever-happened-to-elm-anyway</link>
      <description>I see this question pop up quite frequently in lots of different arenas - folks are curious as to what happened to Elm. As a former community member of Elm, I thought I&amp;#39;d act as a historian here and provide a write up covering the big pieces I see. Everything in this post is public already, I&amp;#39;m just putting it together in one place - and will not touch on anything personal to anyone involved. The interesting parts are not about personal matters - but about the natural to and fro of a niche technology.</description>

      <title>Principles Of Horrible API Documentation</title>
      <link>https://den.dev/blog/horrible-api-documentation/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve worked a fair bit of my PM career leading the efforts in improving the API documentation experiences for developers. Nothing opens your eyes more to the pain of developers than actually building the tooling that makes API docs happen - you start encountering all kinds of quirky edge cases and corners of the API that you thought were simple enough but they are not. The more I saw that, the more I learned about just how big of a slice in the &amp;quot;Developer Experience&amp;quot; pie &amp;quot;API Documentation&amp;quot; is.</description>

      <description>Today I read Alex Russell&amp;#39;s post The Market for Lemons and I found myself compelled to write a rebuttal. I am a big fan of Alex&amp;#39;s work in general but not of this post in particular, which is very long, so allow me to attempt to summarize it:

JavaScript-heavy single page apps (SPAs) are very popular
The web is mobile-first and Android-dominated
JavaScript-heavy apps do not perform well on mobile Android</description>

      <title>Using Cell Phone Sensors for 3D Transformations – Ramatak Inc.</title>
      <link>https://ramatak.com/2023/02/13/using-cell-phone-sensors-for-3d-transformations/</link>
      <description>It’s a well-known fact that our mobile devices come equipped with all kinds of sensors used for various features that we tend to take for granted. For example, a phone knows if it’s held in portrait or landscape orientation, it knows if you’re walking in a certain direction, and it can even detect if you’ve left it on a table screen-up or screen-down. All of this information is calculated internally using various electronic sensors. But, as game devs can we make use of these sensors for our video games? The answer is yes, and it’s relatively straightforward.</description>

      <description>We are fucked.
In fact, we are so fucked that Tom Scott conveniently released a new video talking about how fucked we are. Of course, he didn&amp;#39;t actually say that we&amp;#39;re fucked, because he&amp;#39;s much nicer than I am. He uses soft and gentle words that disguise the raging maelstrom beneath us. His video talks about how “everything is about to change”, and he&amp;#39;s right. I think he&amp;#39;s more right than he wants to be, he knows it, and he&amp;#39;s terrified.</description>
