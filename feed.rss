      <description>In April, Nils and I released the proof of concept of Home, Not Alone, a social network made out of independent websites, that can talk to one another. We didn’t develop this further since, because for something like HNA to exist in the real world, we’d need to lay some foundations first. So — today, I’m happy to announce PostOwl. Together with Tom Atkins, we developed a minimalistic self-contained web app that offers you: The easiest way to blog using in-place editing (no technical skills needed) Sharing p…</description>

      <title>Poll Working</title>
      <link>https://hybras.dev/posts/2023-06-06-poll-working/</link>
      <description>Today I was a poll worker in New Jersey’s Primary election. I was the only brown person, and one of 2 people below the age of 55. The other person was middle aged. Suffice it to say, almost everyone involved in the process was basically a retiree. It was a massive culture shock for me. I felt tapped into the soul of my country for a day.
Democracy is Dead I had to show up at 6am, which felt offensive.</description>

So, for instance, let’s […]</description>

      <title>So, you want to deploy on the edge?</title>
      <link>https://zknill.io/posts/edge-database/</link>
      <description>Application developers often deploy their apps into a single area, generally represented by a handful of AZs in a single region. No matter where their users make requests from, those requests get served by the region where the developers’ apps run.
If a user makes a request from Europe, and the apps run in US East, that adds an extra 100-150ms of latency just by round-tripping across the Atlantic.
Edge computing tries to solve this problem, by letting app developers deploy their applications across the globe, so that apps serve the user requests closer to the user.</description>

further so I could first solve it for myself. The problem is stated as follows:</description>

      <description>F# has introduced a new syntax feature in preview to make it easier to work with interpolated strings. The main advantage of the new syntax is it allows to customize how many curly braces delimit an interpolated expression, thus reducing the need for escaping special characters.</description>

      <title>Modular Monoliths with Layla Porter</title>
      <link>https://open.spotify.com/episode/52uCuoROysgv3EhHlpRqph</link>
      <description>Listen to this episode from .NET Rocks! on Spotify. Microservices or Monoliths? Carl and Richard talk to Layla Porter about choosing a middle ground between microservices and monoliths, with modular monoliths. Layla talks about the pushback from the community around microservices and the insistence that there is &amp;quot;one right way.&amp;quot; Monoliths have their advantages until they are a problem - but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that re-architecting everything is the right way to go. Chipping off parts of the monolith into satellite modules strikes a balance of flexibility and scalability - and opens the door to accessing the power of bus architectures when needed!</description>
