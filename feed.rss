      <title>Dolphin Emulator</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2021/05/24/temptation-of-the-apple-dolphin-on-macos-m1/</link>
      <description>From the announcement made on November 10th, 2020, users have had high hopes for the new Apple M1 devices. With its powerful Apple Silicon processor smashing benchmarks all over the place, users and developers were both asking if a native Dolphin build would be possible. Now we have the answer.

Apple&amp;#39;s M1 hardware is incredibly powerful and excels at running Dolphin. This announcement has been in the works for some time, eagle eyed users may have noticed that earlier this month macOS builds were now being designated as &amp;quot;Intel&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s because delroth and Skyler had set up a new buildbot using a service called MacStadium for creating Universal macOS binaries. These builds are available immediately and natively support both macOS M1 and Intel macOS devices.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210524-00/?p=105240</link>
      <description>The Windows Runtime supports static members, which are members that apply to a class as a whole, rather than to particular instances of a class. The expectation is that these members are exposed via the language projection as static members of some language-specific representation of the class.</description>

      <description>We couldn&amp;#39;t decide if we wanted to gather around the water cooler or talk about some cool APIs, so we opted to do both, while Joe promises there&amp;#39;s a W in his name, Allen doesn&amp;#39;t want to say graph, and Michael isn&amp;#39;t calling out applets.</description>

      <title>C is not a serious programming language – keeping simple</title>
      <link>https://www.yodaiken.com/2021/05/16/c-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/</link>
      <description>The C Standards process over the last few decades has addressed both optimization and pointer type safety largely through a concept called “undefined behavior”.&amp;#160; The idea is that instead of&amp;#160; positive rules for what compilers and programmers can do, the Standard will identify some program behavior as something compilers can interpret how they want — really without any guidance at all. These things are not errors that must cause the compiler to reject code or even, necessarily things the compiler must warn about, but are instances of behavior that are without rules. I think this whole process is due to a misreading of the standard., but more importantly, it’s sloppy, makes it hard for programmers to have an intuition about the language, and leads to paradoxical results or nasty surprises.&amp;#160; For example, writing a value to a&amp;#160; variable from a pointer that has been advanced past the end of the object it was supposed to point to has been sort-of-kind-of designated as “undefined behavior”. Here’s&amp;#160; an example: the output of a simple C program compiled and “optimized” by gcc 11</description>

      <title>Hacking third-party APIs on the JVM</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/hacking-third-party-api-jvm/</link>
      <description>The JVM ecosystem is mature and offers plenty of libraries, so you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Basic - and not so basic - functionalities are just a dependency away. Sometimes, however, the dependency and your use-case are slightly misaligned. The correct way to fix this would be to create a Pull Request. But your deadline is tomorrow: you need to make it work now! It’s time to hack the provided API. In this post, we are going through some alternatives that allow you to make</description>

      <title>A hacker mindset</title>
      <link>https://sul.im/blog/a-hacker-mindset/</link>
      <description>Sometimes to solve a problem we tend to choose a set of tools we got used to. How often we pick a tool just because we know it, and not necessarily because it&amp;#39;s the right one for a task at hand? These are my rules to overcome that.</description>

      <description>Trackmania United Forever is a racing game in which the goal is to complete any track as fast as possible. Players compete against each other for the fastest times on tracks, and in order to keep records centralized, the community developed a website called Trackmania Exchange. This website maintains a “Top 10” leaderboard for all official tracks released by Nadeo and for hundreds of thousands of user submitted tracks, and is the main leaderboard Trackmania players compete on.</description>
