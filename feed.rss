      <description>Earlier this year, the FBI in partnership with the Dutch National High Technical Crimes Unit (NHTCU), German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and other international law enforcement agencies brought down what Europol rereferred to as the world&amp;#39;s most dangerous malware: Emotet.

      <link>https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2021/04/24/can-remote-work-work.html</link>
      <description>Everyone is grappling with these questions right now: can remote teams produce
the same results as in-person teams? Do companies need to go remote to stay
competitive in the technology job market? What effects, if any, would a sea
change in remote work have on the way we engage with our occupations?</description>

      <title>Dabbling in Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/crypt.html</link>
      <description>This note tells the story of some work that I was involved with, but
to which I was not a primary contributor.  For reasons that should
become clear, the people most involved have not gone public with their results.
Still, it is one of the more interesting things I&amp;#39;ve done and seen.
The central events occurred around 1977.
Jim Reeds reminds me that the incident was already babbled to
John Markoff and recorded in the book by Markoff and Katie Hafner (Cyberpunk: Outlaws
and Hackers on the Computer Frontier, Simon and Schuster, 1991).
This note doesn&amp;#39;t differ materially from that account, but might be a bit more complete.</description>

      <title>Ether as a computation unit</title>
      <link>https://blog.merwanedrai.com/2021/04/24/ether-as-a-computation-unit.html</link>
      <description>The Bitcoin community dreams of Hyperbitcoinization, and believes the endgame of bitcoin (or satoshis, a smaller denomination of it) is to become a major unit of account. Their idea is to have things commercially priced in bitcoin rather than the local currency. I don’t know if the Ethereum community shares the same vision for Ether, but this isn’t necessarily what is needed, or the best we can get out of the cryptocurrency.</description>

      <title>Books I&amp;#39;ve Read (2020)</title>
      <link>http://devinlogan.org/e-readers.html</link>
      <description>I’ve never been a fan of e-readers. I’m put off by the prospect of paying for a book that only exists on a device, especially when the price of e-books approaches or exceeds the cost of physical books (especially the used copies I tend to buy). I also just love physical books – the weight and feel of them, the experience of reading, the look of books on my shelf.</description>

      <description>Suppose you want a coroutine that terminates on unhandled exceptions, or equivalently (looking at it from the consumer side) a coroutine that never throws an exception when awaited. For regular functions, the way to say this is to put the noexcept exception specification on your function declaration: int GetValue() noexcept {   return LoadValue();</description>

      <title>How to send an email with dynamic templates from SendGrid with ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-send-email-with-dynamic-templates-from-sendgrid/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about sending emails with dynamic templates from SendGrid with ASP.NET Core. SendGrid will help you to configure and send emails from your apps using SMTP API and SendGrid API. SendGrid also helps you to design and configure email templates from their admin portal. In one of applications I am building I am using Azure B2C - which currently supports custom from email address with the help of SendGrid. You can find more details about how to configure it from here. So first you need to create dynamic template from SendGrid. You can create it from https://mc.sendgrid.com/dynamic-templates. You can create the template either using Code Editor or Design Editor.</description>

      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/04/24/service-now-api-and-typescript-conditional-types/</link>
      <description>The Service Now REST API is an API which allows you to interact with Service Now. It produces different shaped results based upon the sysparmdisplayvalue query parameter. This post looks at how we can model these API results with TypeScripts conditional types. The aim being to minimise repetition whilst remaining strongly typed. This post is specifically about the Service Now API, but the principles around conditional type usage are generally applicable.</description>
