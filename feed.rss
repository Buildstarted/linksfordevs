      <title>How to generate video thumbnail with Azure function</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-generate-video-thumbnail-with-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about implementing an azure function which generate a thumbnail image for a video stored in Azure Storage. In one of the project I am working there is a requirement to extract thumbnail for the video uploaded by user to a Azure Storage Account. This is implemented using .NET and C#. For extracting the video thumbnail - FFMediaToolkit package is used. And I am using ImageSharp package is for saving the image as well. I am using Azure Portal to create the function. You can use the same code if you’re using Visual Studio or VS Code, for the simplicity I am using CSX function. The function is using Windows OS. Platform is 64 Bit. Once you created the function app, create a new function with Blob Trigger.</description>

      <description>You want to be clear about the problem your product was designed to help people solve. A narrow, specific promise is easier to deliver on. It sets clear expectations and leaves very little wiggle room for misunderstandings. A broad, vague promise just leaves the door wide open to a mediocre product experience.

      <title>Buy Nothing groups in Mountain View and San Mateo</title>
      <link>http://devinlogan.org/buy_nothing.html</link>
      <description>I moved from Mountain View to San Mateo at the end of March. In anticipation of my move, I joined my Mountain View neighborhood’s Buy Nothing group in order to offload some of the things that I didn’t want to pack up and move – things like clothes I no longer wore, books I read and didn’t like, some cheap IKEA furniture that I longer needed, and various items of an old roommate that I’d never gotten around to getting rid of. The Mountain View Buy Nothing group I joined was extremely active – multiple people expressed interest in almost everything I posted, and I was ultimately able to rehome a lot of items. I was surprised how great doing this felt – less profit driven than donating to Goodwill, more “useful” than bringing to the recycling center, more personal than posting on the free section of Craigslist, and more altruistic than selling on eBay (not that I could sell things like miscellaneous light bulbs anyway).</description>
