      <title>Why Innovation Heroes are a Sign of a Dysfunctional Organization</title>
      <link>https://steveblank.substack.com/p/why-innovation-heroes-are-a-sign</link>
      <description>A week ago I got invited to an “innovation hero” award ceremony at a government agency. I don’t know how many of these I’ve been to in the last couple years, but this one just made my head explode. The award was for an entrepreneur who worked against all odds to buck the system to turn her insight into an application. She had realized it was possible to automate a process that was being done manually – reentering data from one spreadsheet to another and annotating it with additional data from another system. Inspired by her own work problem, she talked to her peers and other stakeholders, built multiple minimum viable products, and figured out how to get engineering, policy, legal, security and everyone else in the enterprise to actually approve it. And then she fought with the acquisition folks to buy the trivial amount of additional hardware needed to connect it. It was a development process that would’ve taken three weeks in a startup, but inside this agency took 10 months (which was considered fast.) At each step she was confronted with “we’re not budgeted for this” or “this isn’t on our schedule” and “this isn’t your job.” Most rational people would’ve given up and said “you can’t fight the system“ but yet she persisted.</description>

      <link>https://bohdankit.com/does-chatgpt-make-us-dumber/</link>
      <description>Over the past year, I’ve started delegating more of my personal and work tasks to ChatGPT. If I find myself unable to delegate something due to poor reception or another silly reason, a small wave of irritation stirs inside me. Convenience is the path of least resistance, but what if resistance is sometimes necessary? Calculators […]</description>

      <title>Sidle</title>
      <link>https://aaronson.org/blog/sidle</link>
      <description>One of my favorite idea-having times is when I’m in bed, with my eyes closed, not quite asleep but not quite awake, in the hypnagogic state where the mind starts to make connections and realizations that it wouldn’t normally make during the day. Oftentimes these thoughts aren’t worth remembering, but sometimes I get out of bed and write them down, and sometimes they turn into yearlong side projects.</description>
