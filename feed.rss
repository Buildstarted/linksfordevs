      <title>Creating a virtual stage when in-person isn’t possible - AI for Business</title>
      <link>https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/creating-a-virtual-stage/</link>
      <description>One of my favorite video games is Age of Empires. I used to play it with coworkers almost two decades ago, and I still play it with my son who beats me with no mercy. One of the magical moments of the game is when you advance the age of your civilization, from feudal to castle to imperial age. Each age brings new technologies that open entirely new ways of driving your strategy to defend from your opponent and win the game.</description>

      <title>Announcing Uno Platform 3.0 - Support for WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/announcing-uno-platform-3-0-support-for-winui-3-0-preview-1/</link>
      <description>Today, the Uno Platform is adding support for WinUI 3.0 Preview, alongside WinUI 2/UWP and later. This allows applications to use newer APIs from Microsoft and create cross platforms apps. We’ve worked closely together with the WinUI team in order to be able to bring you Uno Platform 3.0 release at the same time WinUI 3.0 Preview 1 is being announced at Microsoft Build 2020 conference. With the approach of keeping both API sets active with two nuget packages (Uno.UI and Uno.WinUI), we’re making sure that we’re not breaking existing applications, while enabling experiments with WinUI 3.0 Preview 1. About Uno Platform For those new to Uno Platform – it enables for creation of single-source C# and XAML apps which run natively on iOS, Android, macOS and Web via WebAssembly. (or #WinUIEverywhere). Uno Platform is Open Source (Apache 2.0) and available on GitHub. To learn more about Uno Platform, see how it works, or create a small sample app. Sample Uno Platform App with Source Code – Ch9 To showcase the power of WinUI and Uno Platform in a cross-platform setup, we created a small app which consumes videos from publicly available Channel 9 RSS feed – about 40 most recent videos …</description>

      <description>We left off in the last post after having discussed the Hadamard gate – our first quantum gate – and how it can be used to crate a uniform superposiiton for a single qubit. We are going to continue today by exploring other single qubit gates, discussing the underlying mathematics and, of course, testing it all out with some Q# code.</description>

      <title>What Is Nix</title>
      <link>https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix</link>
      <description>Join us on May 25, 2020 at 1:00 pm EST for ShipIt! presents How Shopify Uses Nix, a discussion about how Shopify is using Nix to rebuild our developer tooling with Burke Libbey. Please register.
Over the past year and a bit, Shopify has been progressively rebuilding parts of our developer tooling with Nix. I initially planned to write about how we're using Nix now, and what we're going to do with it in the future (spoiler: everything?). However, I realize that most of you won't have a really clear handle on what Nix is, and I haven't found a lot of the introductory material to convey a clear impression very quickly, so this article is going to be a crash course in what Nix is, how to think about it, and why it's such a valuable and paradigm-shifting piece of technology.
There are a few places in this post where I will lie to you in subtle ways to gloss over all of the small nuances and exceptions to rules. I'm not going to call these out. I'm just trying to build a general understanding. At the end of this post, you should have the basic conceptual scaffolding you need in order to think about Nix. Let's dive in!
What is Nix?
The most basic, fundamental idea behind Nix is this:
Everything on your computer implicitly depends on a whole bunch of other things on your computer.


All software exists in a graph of dependencies.

Most of the time, this graph is implicit.

Nix makes this graph explicit.

Four Building Blocks
Let's get this out of the way up front: Nix is a hard thing to explain.
There are a few components that you have to understand in order to really get it, and all of their explanations are somewhat interdependent; and, even after explaining all of these building blocks, it still takes a bit of mulling over the implications of how they compose in order for the magic of Nix to really click. Nevertheless, we'll try, one block at a time.
The major building blocks, at least in my mental model of Nix, are:

The Nix Store
Derivations
Sandboxing
The Nix Language.

The Nix Store
The easiest place to start is the Nix Store. Once you've installed Nix, you'll wind up with a directory at /nix/store, containing a whole bunch of entries that look something like this:
3mfcmgmpcqjajpdhfh8pdazmmd4vskns-nix-2.3.3-man/h9bvv0qpiygnqykn4bf7r3xrxmvqpsrd-nix-2.3.3/nrb3rkvwz114053yh00r7p2dlc9igp03-nix-2.3.3.drv
This directory, /nix/store, is a kind of Graph Database. Each entry (each file or directory directly under /nix/store) is a Node in that Graph Database, and the relationships between them constitute Edges.
The only thing that's allowed to write directories and files into /nix/store is Nix itself, and after Nix writes a Node into this Graph Database, it's completely immutable forever after: Nix guarantees that the contents of a Node doesn't change after it's been created. Further, due to magic that we'll discuss later, the contents of a given Node is guaranteed to be functionally identical to a Node with the same name in some other Graph, regardless of where they're built.
What, then, is a </description>
