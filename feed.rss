      <title>From engineer to manager: what I love, what I hate</title>
      <link>https://thoughtspile.github.io/2024/02/16/eng-to-em/</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s been almost 2 years since I moved to a team lead role, then to a full-time engineering management position after the expansion of our team. I&amp;#39;ve been a front-end developer for 7 years before that, and initially I took the &amp;quot;advanced individual contributor&amp;quot; career track before doing the management turnaround. How&amp;#39;s it been? Bumpy, but fun. In this article, I&amp;#39;ll share the things I love and hate about my current job.</description>

      <title>Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171</link>
      <description>This paper describes Meta&amp;#39;s TestGen-LLM tool, which uses LLMs to automatically improve existing human-written tests. TestGen-LLM verifies that its generated test classes successfully clear a set of filters that assure measurable improvement over the original test suite, thereby eliminating problems due to LLM hallucination. We describe the deployment of TestGen-LLM at Meta test-a-thons for the Instagram and Facebook platforms. In an evaluation on Reels and Stories products for Instagram, 75% of TestGen-LLM&amp;#39;s test cases built correctly, 57% passed reliably, and 25% increased coverage. During Meta&amp;#39;s Instagram and Facebook test-a-thons, it improved 11.5% of all classes to which it was applied, with 73% of its recommendations being accepted for production deployment by Meta software engineers. We believe this is the first report on industrial scale deployment of LLM-generated code backed by such assurances of code improvement.</description>

      <title>Considerations for a long-running Raspberry Pi # Chris Dzombak</title>

      <description>Keeping a Raspberry Pi online and working with zero intervention for weeks, months, or years is somewhat of an art form. Several classes of things can go wrong, and you need to consider how your Pi will recover from each of them.</description>

      <title>Forgejo forks its own path forward</title>
      <link>https://forgejo.org/2024-02-forking-forward/</link>
      <description>Since its inception, Forgejo (a self-hosted git forge, like GitHub) has been a soft fork of Gitea. Upgrading to it was - and for the time being, remains to be - as simple as changing the URL from which the release is downloaded. Over time, the way Forgejo is governed and developed evolved. To be able to provide stable, secure, reliable releases, Forgejo requires a reasonable effort made at writing tests for each change that goes into the code. This has worked out remarkably well, as it caught both regressions in imported code, and mistakes in proposed changes. Furthermore, Forgejo has accepted features and other changes that are not available in Gitea, and has diverged in other ways already.</description>
