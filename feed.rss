      <title>Macro and Micro Necessity - Colin McGinn</title>
      <link>https://www.colinmcginn.net/macro-and-micro-necessity/</link>
      <description>Macro and Micro Necessity A curious fact of necessity studies: although necessity is liberally spoken of, its extent is rarely tabulated. We find reference to necessities involving people and items of furniture (and the occasional cat) but little in the way of mapping the full distribution of necessities in the world, or their interconnections.

      <description>I love learning new things. Rabbit holes can be fun. This year I dug into double-entry accounting. And I didn’t just learn the theory; I decided to use double-entry accounting, with some open source plain text accounting software, for personal finances.</description>

      <title>To A Man With `jq`, Everything Looks Like JSON</title>
      <link>https://ishan.page/blog/2023-12-07-jq-hammer-nails/</link>
      <description>Featured Photo by energepic.com
 I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve had a love-hate relationship with Bootstrap for a long time. While I love how fast it lets me get going, I absolutely hate the cookie cutter vibe of most of the stuff that I end up making with it. Bootswatch is awesome, and I know that I could customize my theme with SASS variables, but that adds a build step, which is additional complexity that I want to avoid when I am making business/CRUD applications.</description>

      <title>What can routers at Centre Pompidou teach us about software evolution?</title>
      <link>https://tomasp.net/blog/2023/pompidou/</link>
      <description> The later addition to the building is a perfect metaphor for the typical problems
of software development. The building uses a colour scheme to indicate its different basic
structures, but the routers, being a recent addition, do not fit the scheme. Can we come up
with a way of building buildings and software that makes such large-scale adaptations
possible? What would a Centre Pompidou plan look like if it was supposed to accommodate the
late addition of new basic networks?</description>

      <description>As the Axelar network expands and the Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) goes live (subject to governance approvals), building and managing connections to the network is becoming easier and easier.  Furthermore, programmability at the network layer allows us to code at both the control and data paths of interoperability across Web3. In this post, we summarize some infrastructure ideas for teams interested in engaging in back-end protocol and network development.  The initial roll-out of the AVM (power...</description>

      <description>On July 11th, 2023 I was a guest on The Modern .NET
Show and had a great time talking to Jamie Taylor
(twitter,
fediverse) about
Sep (the world’s fastest .NET CSV library)  and
in particular performance and optimizations. The podcast has just been
released
and you can listen to it and read the show notes I made below. Please consider

      <title>Simple Feature Gross Code</title>
      <link>https://anguscheng.com/post/2023-12-07-simple-feature-gross-code/</link>
      <description>A few days ago I talked about supporting text events with multiple colours and multiple text speeds. I spent about eight hours writing the code. It took me a lot longer than I expected so I thought I’d share the details here.
Example Data set_title(data, PHOENIX); set_text_color(data, SKYBLUE); add_show_text_V2(data, &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re saying the jay walker was... &amp;quot;); set_text_color(data, RED); add_show_text_V2(data, &amp;quot;you.&amp;quot;); set_text_color(data, SKYBLUE); This is how I was expecting to set up the events.</description>

      <title>The diminishing half-life of knowledge</title>
      <link>https://rednafi.com/zephyr/diminishing_half_life_of_knowledge/</link>
      <description>Ever been in a situation where you landed a software engineering job with a particular tech stack, mastered it, switched to another company with a different stack, nailed that too, and then found yourself in a third company that used the original stack? Now, you suddenly sense that your hard-earned acumen in that initial stack has not only atrophied over the years but also a portion, or all of it, has become irrelevant, making it a bit of a struggle to catch up with the latest changes.</description>

      <title>The real price of things</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/the-real-price-of-things/</link>
      <description>When we buy something, we pay only a small fraction of its cost.
I reflected on this while also realizing how many good things capitalism does for us (others not so good, but that’s for another day). Given enough demand, more companies compete to offer you a better product, usually at a lower price. Products get better and cheaper over time.
Take ‘Elden Ring’ as an example. This video game, five years in the making, can be purchased for 60 USD and is yours forever.</description>
