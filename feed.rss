      <title>Exploring spatial representations in Visual Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://markusfrey.org/posts/prayn/clip.html</link>
      <description>Recent publications studying the inner workings of foundation models have focused largely on 
                internal representations of large language models (LLMs). In this short blog post, I will explore neural
                 representations in large vision models
                (Radford et al., 
                Oquab et al., 
                Kirillov et al.)
                with the aim to adress a specific question: Can we find spatially selective cells that encode parts of the visual field, 
                akin to the ones found in biological neural networks?</description>

      <link>https://go.dev/doc/go1.22</link>
      <description>The latest Go release, version 1.22, arrives six months after Go 1.21.
  Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.
  As always, the release maintains the Go 1 promise of compatibility.
  We expect almost all Go programs to continue to compile and run as before.</description>
