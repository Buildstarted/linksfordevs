      <title>Where's the Shovelware? Why AI Coding Claims Don't Add Up</title>
      <link>https://mikelovesrobots.substack.com/p/wheres-the-shovelware-why-ai-coding</link>
      <description>78% of developers claim AI makes them more productive. 14% say it's a 10x improvement. So where's the flood of new software? Turns out those productivity claims are bullshit.</description>

      <title>All the concerns that make you a boring developer</title>
      <link>https://daverupert.com/2025/08/got-99-engineering-problems-but-a-grift-aint-one/</link>
      <description>I was thinking this morning about how once you understand that your technology choices have security, performance, and accessibility considerations you become a much more boring developer. Acknowledging those obligations can sort of strips the fun out of programming, but we’re better for it.</description>

      <title>Extending Kafka the Hard Way (Part 2)</title>
      <link>https://blog.evacchi.dev/posts/2025/09/03/extending-kafka-the-hard-way-part-2/</link>
      <description>In our old post about Kafka we described how to write a self-contained application to apply arbitrary transforms to an incoming stream of Kafka records and publish the result on a new topic.
In the previous post of this new series, we decided to embark on a new journey, towards embedding data transforms within the broker. In this case, instead of subscribing to a stream of records and applying transforms on the client-side, transforms would be applied directly on the broker.</description>

      <title>40 years later, are Bentley's "Programming Pearls" still relevant?</title>

      <description>In September 1985, Jon Bentley published Programming Pearls. A collection of aphorisms designed to reveal truths about the field of programming.  It's 40 years later - long enough to see several revolutions in the field - so surely these are obsolete, right? They belong in the same category as "always carry a bundle of hay for the horses" or "you won't always have a pocket calculator with you" or …</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding Terminal Editor</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2025/08/31/vibe-coding-terminal-editor.html</link>
      <description>I wrote a small tool for myself as my biannual
routine check of where llms are currently at. I think I've learned a bunch from this exercise. This
is frustrating! I don't want to learn by trial and error, I'd rather read someone's blog post with
lessons learned. Sadly, most of the writing on the topic that percolates to me tends to be
high-level --- easy to nod along while reading, but hard to extract actionable lessons. So this is
what I want to do here, list specific tricks learned.</description>

      <title>Fixing a problem at 40 that stumped me as a 10 year old</title>
      <link>https://duggan.ie/posts/fixing-a-problem-at-40-that-stumped-me-as-a-10-year-old</link>
      <description>A few months ago my parents gave me a box of my stuff they’ve had variously in attics and storage since I moved out in my early twenties.  One of the things in it was my Sega Mega Drive — boxed, and with games and accessories.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a TV that I could connect it to! The only connector packaged with it was designed to plug into the aerial socket of a CRT television.  In the last week however, I've gotten hold of a CRT television after a bit of digging around.</description>

      <description>In this interactive article, we will explore the physical phenomena that create light and the fundamental laws governing its interaction with matter. We will learn how our human eyes capture light and how our brains interpret it as visual information. We will then model approximations of these physical interactions and learn how to create physically realistic renderings of various materials.</description>
