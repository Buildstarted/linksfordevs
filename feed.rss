      <title>The surreal experience of my first developer job - Ben Nuttall</title>
      <link>https://bennuttall.com/the-surreal-experience-of-my-first-developer-job/</link>

First and foremost I had decided to stay in Manchester after uni, rather than risk getting stuck at my parents’ if I moved back home. […]</description>

What’s less discussed are the company’s ties to the potentially millions of sites and services using its software—but now, thankfully, we can get a window into that for ourselves. But don’t get too excited.</description>
