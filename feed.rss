      <title>Why doesn&amp;#39;t my asynchronous read operation complete when I close the handle?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210730-00/?p=105501</link>
      <description>A customer was using asynchronous I/O with an I/O completion port. At the time they wanted to shut things down, they still had an outstanding asynchronous read. To get things to clean up, they closed the file handle, expecting it to cause the Read&amp;#173;File to complete and fail with an error like ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE.</description>

      <description>Azure Static Web Apps Comparison Azure Static Web Apps became generally available (GA) in May 2021, and there has been so much excitement around them, rightly so!

      <title>FSF-funded call for white papers on philosophical and legal questions around Copilot — Free Software Foundation — Working together for free software</title>
      <link>https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot</link>
      <description>Microsoft&amp;#39;s GitHub recently announced a new service known as Copilot.
This service uses machine learning to help suggest code snippets to
developers as they write software. GitHub trained this neural network
with the code hosted on GitHub; while the Free Software Foundation
(FSF) urges free software developers not to host their code on
GitHub, many do, and even many who don&amp;#39;t have their work mirrored
there by others.</description>

      <title>Some career advice.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/career-advice/</link>
      <description>One unexpected perk of publishing a book is that folks start to ask you questions about all sorts of loosely related things. One pretty common thread has been around career advice, I’ve written up most of my advice for easier reusability. Some of the ideas are a bit contradictory, which I suspect is the nature of all useful advice: you’ll have to work through the conflicts and details yourself.</description>

      <description>Wav2vec is a speech encoder model released by the Facebook AI team in late 2019. It quickly became popular in the speech processing community as it enabled new state-of-the-art performance for various speech tasks like automatic speech recognition or emotion recognition. Since its original version, the model has been upgraded to use the Transformers architecture (the same one behind GPT and BERT) and has been re-trained on 12 different languages in a multilingual version.</description>

      <description>People want what’s bad for them; managers want what’s bad for the organisation.
Many in software development like to pretend that management is an elite kind of human being. The kind who does their job every day with a laser focus on rational organisational improvement. People who come in every day and work with an inhuman disregard for their career and standing. After all, the root cause of all software flaws lies in the code and coders, right?</description>
