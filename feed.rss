      <title>Reflections from GoCardless</title>
      <link>https://paprikati.github.io/2021/06/10/leaving-gocardless.html</link>
      <description>This is the first time in my career that I’ve left a company I really liked, which was quite a strange experience. I wanted to share some of the things I’ve learned along the way. I hope to turn many of these into full blog posts, so consider this the bitesize version.</description>

      <title>The Fighting Chess Index – davidsmerdon.com</title>
      <link>https://www.davidsmerdon.com/?p=2168</link>
      <description>The Fighting Chess Index (FCI) is a composite, weighted measure of the combativeness of top chess players. It combines data about the frequency, length and colour of drawn games from 2015-2020 to provide a single score for each individual that can be used to compare the degree of ‘fighting chess’ among players. This article introduces the FCI and the basic methodology, provides current rankings, FAQs, and a technical note with details for replication.</description>

      <title>Fast Navigation in the Command Line</title>
      <link>http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/fast_navigation_in_the_command_line/</link>
      <description>A small list of methods for fast folder navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t promote one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</description>

      <title> Defining a Platform is Hard</title>
      <link>https://sujithjay.com/internal-platforms</link>
      <description>Engineering platforms are a vague concept. Software organisations across the board agree on the need to ‘platformise’ layers of their stack, but struggle to define the term. The question ‘what is a platform’ is met with a response ‘something similar to AWS, but at a higher layer of the company software stack’. I have previously argued why this is a false analogy.</description>

      <title>I Have No Group, and I Must Scream</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/groups/</link>
      <description>One of the central tenets of software development, science, and life in
general is ‘Be humble.’ In software development, this means that you
should always assume that your code is wrong. It’s almost never an
issue with the compiler, the frameworks, or something else. Most of the
time, it is you. This is one of those rarer cases where it is not
you.</description>

      <title>What the &amp;amp;?!$ is an Individual Contributor?</title>
      <link>https://mntlty.dev/2021/06/11/individual-contributor.html</link>
      <description>During interviews with software engineers, they will sometimes ask whether the role is leadership / management or IC (Individual Contributor) only, which raises the question of what the &amp;amp;?!$ is an IC anyways? The implication is that the candidate will not manage others and will be expected to write code (not that the two are mutually exclusive), but I don’t think the term means much of anything. After all, isn’t every employee an individual who contributes?</description>

      <title>The Productivity Implications of Working from Home Across 150,000 Employees by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/work-from-home-productivity/</link>
      <description>Are we more productive at the office or at home? Researchers from the University of Chicago published data on the productivity trends across 150,000 employees of a large IT services company to answer that question. It’s the first time I’ve seen analysis on the same business through the period. The business had deployed software to monitor employee behavior before COVID and used it throughout.
Quoting from the paper: WFH reduced total commuting time among US workers by more than 60 million hours.</description>

      <description>polkit is a system service installed by default on many Linux distributions. It’s used by systemd, so any Linux distribution that uses systemd also uses polkit. As a member of GitHub Security Lab, my job is to help improve the security of open source software by finding and reporting vulnerabilities. A few weeks ago, I found a privilege escalation vulnerability in polkit.</description>

      <title>artificial life environment</title>
      <link>https://alien-project.org/</link>
      <description>Artificial Life Environment (ALiEn) is a simulation program based on a specialized 2D physics and rendering engine in CUDA. Each simulated body has a graph-like structure of connected building blocks that can either be programmed or equipped with functions to act in the world (accelerators, sensors, weapons, constructors, etc.). Such internal processes are triggered by signals coming from circulating tokens. The bodies can be thought of as small machines or agents operating in a common environment.</description>
