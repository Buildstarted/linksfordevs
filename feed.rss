      <title>Demystifying Network Programming: The Backbone of Modern Applications - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/demystifying-network-programming-the-backbone-of-modern-applications/</link>
      <description>Network programming might sound intimidating, but at its core, it’s the art of making applications talk to each other. Whether it’s your favorite messaging app sending texts in real-time or your smartwatch syncing health stats to your phone, network programming is the magic behind it all. It’s not just a technical skill—it’s the backbone of our interconnected digital world.</description>

      <title>Building Webhooks in .NET: Adding PostgreSQL Database Storage (part 2)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=nbDYwxIeivs</link>

Join a community of 1000+ .NET developers: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic

In Part 1, we built a Webhooks system that worked great but lost all data when the app restarted. Now we&amp;#39;re adding PostgreSQL to store both webhook subscriptions and delivery attempts, making our system production-ready and resilient. We&amp;#39;ll walk through the full database implementation, including entity design, repository pattern setup, and proper error handling. This is a practical, no-nonsense guide to adding persistence to your Webhook system in .NET.

      <link>https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/</link>
      <description>The year is 2025. The internet in the shape that we&amp;#39;ve known it in the early 2000s is no longer there. Or, not quite in the shape that we&amp;#39;ve seen it before. This is not just plain nostalgia talking - the vibrant ecosystem of blogs, feeds, personal sites, and forums has been usurped by a few mega-concentrated players.</description>

      <title>What&amp;#39;s one benefit of the mediator design pattern?</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=ehhzObzt1D0</link>
      <description>The mediator design pattern helps to decouple communication between different parts of your system.

In a hypothetical C# project, that would mean that you don&amp;#39;t need to know about the type or the instance of the destination you want your message to go to. You don&amp;#39;t really need to know anything concrete about the destination because you&amp;#39;ll never have one module talk directly to another!

Instead, we route things through the mediator. The mediator has the responsibility of knowing how to take incoming messages and get them to the right destinations. This means that we use the mediator&amp;#39;s API to communicate, and not necessarily the API of the destination directly.

      <link>https://vinay.sh/i-am-rich-and-have-no-idea-what-to-do-with-my-life/</link>
      <description>Life has been a haze this last year. After selling my company, I find myself in the totally un-relatable position of never having to work again. Everything feels like a side quest, but not in an inspiring way. I don’t have the same base desires driving me to make money or gain status. I have infinite freedom, yet I don’t know what to do with it, and, honestly, I’m not the most optimistic about life.</description>

      <description>I started the new year with a very puzzling bug. One of the users of my internal dashboard tool told me that he doesn’t see some of the rows he expected to see. I checked the query that populated the view, which had various filters but none of them looked suspicious, expect one of them. There was an IFNULL looking at me in the query which smelled awful.</description>

      <title>Why does L1 regularization encourage coefficients to shrink to zero? – Madiyar’s Page</title>
      <link>https://maitbayev.github.io/posts/why-l1-loss-encourage-coefficients-to-shrink-to-zero/</link>
      <description>Regularization is a common method for dealing with overfitting in Machine Learning (ML). The simplest and most widely used methods are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). The L1 and L2 regularizations are well covered in numerous tutorials and books. However, I could not find any good geometric or intuitive explanation of why L1 encourages coefficients to shrink to zero. This post tries to address this.</description>

      <title>My Deep-cut Book Recs | Marcus&amp;#39; Blog</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/deep-cut-book-recs</link>
      <description>Here are some lesser-known books I’ve loved, that you won’t find in typical recommendation lists – the deep-cuts.
Replacing Guilt: Minding Our Way This book is all about the role of guilt. When is it useful, when is it not, what can be done about it.
This could have easily been packaged like a best-selling pop-psychology book – padded to 200 pages with a sampling of the same anecdotes we’ve all read 100 times, fitting a narrative to the life of a celebrity or two to lend credibility, and repeating the same core message a hundred times. Instead it felt like reading a well-organized journal entry. I both respect the author for taking the path less traveled, and love the format for its own sake. I wish more books like this existed. It’s sort of in a class of its own.</description>

      <title>Programming a GPU on bare metal</title>
      <link>https://macoy.me/blog/programming/PiGPU</link>
      <description>I virtually attended Handmade Seattle 2024, where Mason Remaley presented &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s Not About the API&amp;quot; (link eventually), which discussed Vulkan. There was a question about how the buffer data layouts work on the GPU, and the speaker didn&amp;#39;t have a clear answer. I don&amp;#39;t want to come across as criticizing Mason by saying this; rather, I&amp;#39;m saying this kind of low-level information on GPUs is hard to come by because their internals are rarely revealed or discussed.</description>

      <title>Emulating the FMAdd Instruction, Part 1: 32-bit Floats [JoshJers&amp;#39; Ramblings]</title>
      <link>https://drilian.com/posts/2024.12.31-emulating-the-fmadd-instruction-part-1-32-bit-floats/</link>
      <description>A thing that I had to do at work is write an emulation of the FMAdd (fused multiply-add) instruction for hardware where it wasn&amp;#39;t natively supported (specifically I was writing a SIMD implementation, but the idea is the same), and so I thought I&amp;#39;d share a little bit about how FMAdd works, since I&amp;#39;ve already been posting about how float rounding works.</description>
