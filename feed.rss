      <description>Metaphors are powerful tools to transfer ideas from one mind to another. Alan Kay introduced the alternative meaning of the term ‘desktop’ at Xerox PARC in 1970. Nowadays everyone - for a glimpse of a second - has to wonder what is actually meant when referring to a desktop. Recently, Deep Learning had the pleasure to welcome a new powerful metaphor: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH).</description>

      <description>So far we've talked about checking our Bolt program is correct, but now we're moving on to actually running it. One problem though, a lot of our high-level constructs like objects and methods don't exist in LLVM IR - we need to map them to simpler constructs.</description>

      <title>Respecting Browser Navigation in Single Page Applications</title>
      <link>https://rakhman.info/blog/respecting-browser-navigation-spa/</link>
      <description>Anchors (&lt;a href="..."&gt;) offer a simple concept for navigating between web pages. Clicking on them opens the URL. When using the left mouse button, the HTML decides if the page is opened in the same tab (default) or in a new tab (target="_blank"). Browsers provide the user with the possibility to override this behavior by middle clicking, CTRL clicking or using the context menu.</description>

      <link>https://yenkel.dev/posts/a-tale-of-latency-and-broken-windows</link>
      <description>Latency can get out of control because of small day to day changes. Dedicate a small amount of time to think about latency when making changes to keep it under control. parallel I/O, pre-fetching, and avoiding I/O are some simple techniques you can use.</description>
