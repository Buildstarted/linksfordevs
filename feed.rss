      <description>Summary: Squashing is a good tool to have, but not everything should be squashed away. Intermediate commit history can have value. Please don't squash rework on a PR during the review phase. If you do, the reviewers may have to start over from scratch.</description>

      <title>Almost Paperless Office</title>
      <link>https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/almost-paperless-office/</link>
      <description>Recently I looked at my increasingly large pile of important documents and decided to make sorting them a small project. After a while it was clear that a lot of them are not important enough to keep around. Invoices, warranty certificates or insurance status updates are likely not necessary to have in their original paper form.
Having them in a big binder makes it very hard to quickly find a document that you know you have somewhere.</description>

      <title>Thought: Handling rate limited apis</title>
      <link>https://blog.timkaechele.me/2020/06/14/handling-rate-limiting-with-sidekiq-ruby.html</link>
      <description>When dealing with third party web apis one often times encounter that the
api you want to use is rate limited, which is a reasonable measure by the service
provider to prevent users from overloading the system. But nevertheless it’s often
times a big inconvenience when you have a lot of requests to make and you will
exceed the rate limit. Most systems work by limiting the amount of requests
in a given timespan.</description>

      <description>This is just a quick note to mention that I have updated my hardware
documentation on the Librem 13v4 laptop. It has unfortunately
turned into a rather lengthy (and ranty) piece about Purism. Let's
just say that waiting weeks for your replacement laptop (yes, it died
again) does wonders for creativity. To quote the full review:</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of talk about privilege lately. Although the
concept is overused, there is something to it, and in particular
to the idea that privilege makes you blind — that you can't see
things that are visible to someone whose life is very different
from yours.</description>

      <description>Although it doesn’t look like it, Yaser is an almond croissant addict cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living out of thin air and sitting in a café eating a croissant and drinking a cappuccino, he’s focused his energy on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from that, he has a hunger for public speaking, hence a number of talks in big conferences like NDC and Voxxed Days around the world under his belt.
