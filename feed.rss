      <title>Laid off, now what?</title>
      <link>https://bharathpbhat.github.io/2020/09/19/laid-off-now-what.html</link>
      <description>As an immigrant on an H1B, you have exactly 60 days to find a new job when you are laid-off. This is a very short window of time to explore and land any job, let alone a job that matches your skills and interests. I found myself in this situation along with many others when Uber announced layoffs earlier this year. The following is a recollection of some things that worked well for me during my eventually successful job hunt.</description>

      <title>Valerie Phoenix - Empowered By Imposter Syndrome [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk5Kd_dBz9w</link>
      <description>Imposter syndrome is something that the industry continues to represent as a negative. My take on this as a black woman in tech is we need to turn all of our disadvantages into growth opportunities. Adding structure to our learning path is the best way of removing the negative image of feeling like an imposter and allows us to flourish.

      <title>Secrets I use to becoming a better remote developer</title>
      <link>https://mateusfreira.github.io/@mateusfreira-secrets-to-becoming-a-better-remote-developer/</link>
      <description>I have been working as a remote developer fulltime, for the last five years. Part-time/freelancing for at least ten years, over this time, I have collected several tips and tricks on how to become better at it and how to succeed and deliver results under this environment. I am writing this post to share some of these tricks, while this is a brief list. I am always testing these things. I thought it would be useful to do this one and periodically create a new one to share some updates.

      <title>MEAN Stack Considered Harmful</title>
      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/mean-stack/</link>
      <description>The MEAN stack is everywhere.
Proponents promise getting started is easy.
Hundreds of boot camps provide crash courses promising a MEAN stack job. You don’t owe them until you get hired. No win, no fee.
Developers write thousands of words teaching the stack, preaching the benefits. Become a “full stack developer” in as little as twelve weeks.
It’s adored by greenfield developers. They can build new projects fast. And move on even faster.</description>

      <title>How Do Neobanks Make Money?</title>
      <link>https://blog.mattheakis.com/how_do_neobanks_make_money/</link>
      <description>Neobanks are on a tear and users are loving them. Neobanks are online-only banks, typically funded by venture capital, that piggy-back on top of an existing institution’s banking license and offer a way for customers to store/spend money. Examples include Revolut, Nubank, Chime, Simple, N26, and more. They have a real shot at becoming the mainstream banking choice for customers over the next decade. Nubank, the most popular neobank in Brazil, recently announced that they have 15 million customers. For reference, Wells Fargo has 22 million active users on its mobile app. Neobanks are a rising force and key in understanding where the financial services industry is headed.</description>

      <title>Remote Build Execution</title>
      <link>https://kousiktn.github.io/posts/2020-09-20-remote-build-execution/</link>
      <description>Remote Build Execution - An Overview One of the big benefits of using build systems like Bazel is that it supports remote-execution and caching of the build out of the box. Each action in the build graph can be executed on a remote machine, cached and then downloaded onto the local machine. When there are multiple developers on the team (or you are re-building your project from scratch on a different machine), and if the build has already been run by a developer in the team, then the other developers can simply reuse the results of the previous build thereby reducing the build time and load on the their local machines.</description>

      <title>February 18, 2020 - Giving Blazor a ViewState?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X4MN8cue1A</link>
      <description>Web Forms has ViewState and Blazor manages state in memory... is there a way to re-make Web Forms ViewState for Blazor to help make migration easier?  That's our task in this episode

27:47 - You're telling people not to use the ViewState for new stuff, so step 1: use it and get the move in. Step 2: start refactoring to use better practices. Without step 1 you can't do step 2
29:17 -  I can't sell a change if I have to rewrite a ton of stuff just to move to Blazor.
30:10 - Remember that rewrites are dangerous, refactors are much safer.
40:58 - Ok, but do we like WaitForAssertion instead of VerifyAsyncChange?
1:12:58 - Does it work with VB's inline XML support?
1:38:55 - Has anyone hosted WPF UI elements in Winforms?
1:39:48 - When will MS make stuff open source?

      <title>February 19, 2020 - Blazor Component Updates to Support DataBinding</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBDIwGEWmUs</link>
      <description>In this video, Fritz walks through ensuring that the new DataBinder that we built in a previous video works on the FormView component.

27:32 - Is there an official explanation of the name Blazor?
28:57 - What is the difference between a logo and an icon?
1:08:33 - What is .NET?
1:09:42 - Is there a way to develop an app that can generate static pages so I can put the generated pages on multipage sites?
1:27:24 - Does anyone know if it's possible to have a Component only render it's 'Content' (Child Content) if a certain condition is true inside the component itself?
1:29:22 - How popular is F# and is it worth learning?
1:48:04 - Do you suggest I learn Blazor, MVC, Web Forms, or something else?

      <title>February 16, 2020 - Open Source C#, Blazor, and the DataBinder</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7GRTh7-6P4</link>
      <description>In this episode, Jeff talks about mimicking the ASP.NET Web Forms DataBinder object so that it's syntax can be re-used in Blazor

11:13 - Do you know if there were any plans to support XAML in Blazor so it would be like programming WPF for web?
16:09 - Anyone know of any dotnet core open-source projects easy to pop in and contribute to?
39:46 - Are you going to add AutoPostBack?
46:39 - Does making DataBinder a Component make it much heavier to execute/needs too much resources?
47:04 - This is using Reflection, right?
1:43:33 - When working with Git branches, should you a) merge 'origin' dev or b) pull 'origin' dev to get changes from dev into the working feature branch and what's the difference?
1:45:40 - Isn't a pull a fetch and merge in one git command?
