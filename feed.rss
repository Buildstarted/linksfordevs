At my previous apartment in the Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, there was a utility pole right outside my apartment that was a real eyesore.

      <description>I love music. I&amp;#39;m also broke. I care a lot about the quality of audio I&amp;#39;m listening: I want to hear every instrument and feel fully immersed in the music, but it&amp;#39;s widely known that good audio quality is expensive. Right? Not exactly. There is an abundance of incredible sounding audio equipment that you can get for surprisingly cheap, as long as you know what to look for. Along with this, repurposing older technology can allow you to stream high fidelity music relatively inexpensively.</description>

      <description>The Visual Studio search experience is getting a new feature that allows users to find and replace text without having to worry about different casings. For example, a method parameter `catalogItemId` and object property `CatalogItemId` have the same name but different capitalization but should both be replaced by something like ‘productId’ with their respective casings.&amp;#160;</description>
