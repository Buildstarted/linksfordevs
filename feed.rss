      <title>PgBouncer is useful, important, and fraught with peril</title>
      <link>https://jpcamara.com/2023/04/12/pgbouncer-is-useful.html</link>
      <description>To start, I want to say that I’m appreciative that PgBouncer exists and the work its open source maintainers put into it. I also love working with PostgreSQL, and I’m thankful for the incredible amount of work and improvements that go into it as well.
I also think community and industry enthusiasm around Postgres is at an all time high. There are more managed hosting options than ever (Crunchy Data, Render, Fly.</description>

      <title>Format JSON in Vim with jq</title>
      <link>https://davidisaksson.dev/posts/format-json-in-vim/</link>
      <description>jq is a very powerful command-line tool designed to manipulate JSON data. One of its great features is that it automatically formats JSON output for better readability:
$ echo &amp;#39;{&amp;quot;is_jq_awesome&amp;quot;: true}&amp;#39; | jq { &amp;quot;is_jq_awesome&amp;quot;: true } But in Vim? Can we utilize this inside of Vim? Of course!
In Vim, there’s a feature called filter commands that enables us to use external applications to modify our buffers. Filter commands take a range, which is a set of contiguous lines, and a command that processes these lines.</description>

      <description>This is the first in what will hopefully be a series of technical write-ups of various aspects of touchHLE, a high-level emulator for iPhone OS applications. (See also: the touchHLE announcement blog post from two months ago.) These write-ups will be aimed at an audience familiar with systems programming, but which isn&amp;#39;t necessarily familiar with emulator development, ARMv6 assembly, Rust, Objective-C, and so on.</description>

      <description>If product management was ever perfected and applied evenly to every single company and industry, we&amp;#39;d likely _swim_ in products that solve all our problems. Unfortunately, good product management is unevenly distributed and often takes on patterns and practices that are very far from optimal.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Making a Copilot with Phil Haack</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1841</link>
      <description>Microsoft is making several Copilot products - should you? Carl and Richard talk to Phil Haack about the latest version of ab.bot, his customer success startup. Now Phil is calling ab.bot a Copilot for Customer Success since he incorporated OpenAI ChatGPT into it. The conversation tries to steer clear of the hysteria around modern large language models (although it is hard!) and more into the practical applications - using large language models to summarize long customer support conversations and find related conversations to current ones - perhaps identifying new high-priority features! The wave of large language models is in its early days, and with the new APIS available, it may be time to make them part of your projects too!</description>
