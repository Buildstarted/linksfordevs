      <description>Gerne denke ich an die 90er zur&amp;#252;ck. Der Start der Heimcomputer, der speziellen Musik, und der Spiele. Eines der Spiele, an die ich gerne zur&amp;#252;ckdenke, ist &amp;quot;Zelda - A Link to the Past&amp;quot;. Schon Ende der 80er hatte Nintendo diese epische Reihe gestartet. So sah das ganze damals aus:  Especially the third part from 1995 had made huge steps forward. Better graphics and orchestral sound. &amp;#160; Until now,&amp;#160;…</description>

      <title>Introducing network.txt: A Standard for 3rd Party Data Transparency</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/introducing-network.txt-a-standard-for-3rd-party-data-transparency/</link>
      <description>In today&amp;amp;rsquo;s digital age, privacy and data protection have become major concerns for both website visitors and developers. With the introduction of GDPR laws, it&amp;amp;rsquo;s important for websites to provide clear information about the sharing of personal data with 3rd party providers. This is where the proposed standard, network.txt, comes into play.
What is network.txt? network.txt is a new standard that provides information about the use of 3rd party providers on a website.</description>

      <title>Taking a look at Nostr</title>
      <link>https://blog.notmyhostna.me/posts/taking-a-look-at-nostr/</link>
      <description>After hearing about Nostr from multiple people over the past weeks I decided to take a look and learn more about it. I found nostr-resources.com, usenostr.org and github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr to be helpful to get an initial overview.
Running a nostr relay As a next step I looked into setting up my own relay and it’s surprisingly simple. I now have a relay based on github.com/scsibug/nostr-rs-relay running at wss://nostr.notmyhostna.me.
I was looking for a simple Go + Postgres relay project but that doesn’t seem to exist yet.</description>

      <description>Newcomer desktop-web framework Tauri has quickly attracted the interest of developers looking to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies.

      <title>Rule of Four</title>
      <link>https://andrew-quinn.me/rule-of-four/</link>
      <description>A communication heuristic, optimized for asynchronous communication of detailed concepts between human beings.
Rationale Existence “proof”  Our short term memory can hold at best about 7 +/- 2 chunks of information at a time. Start with the lower end of that: 5 chunks. Assume that whatever someone is “really” trying to do takes up 1 of those 5. We’re left with 4 chunks.  Conclusion Organize your work processes as much as possible so that they can be effectively understood using at most 4 chunks of short-term memory.</description>

      <title>Setting up a Filecoin Saturn Node - Laurence Vandeyar</title>
      <link>https://laurencevandeyar.com/setting-up-a-filecoin-saturn-node/</link>
      <description>While in Lisbon at the end of 2022 I heard about the Filecoin Saturn launch and thought this was a pretty cool idea to create an on-chain CDN on-top of IPFS. The idea intrigued me to go through the process to setup a node. My setup notes were pretty involved so I figured I&amp;#39;d share it with community.</description>
