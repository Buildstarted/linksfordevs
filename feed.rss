      <title>Why We Upgraded Our Production Application to .NET 5.0</title>
      <link>https://exceptionless.com/why-we-upgraded-our-production-application-to-net-5-0/</link>

However, there are varying schools of thought around when you should upgrade. At Exceptionless, we like to be on the bleeding edge.

As such, we have already upgraded Exceptionless to use .NET … Continued</description>

      <title>Shukri Abdullahi - Through Programming I Became a Better Artist [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqxf-shA0UQ</link>
      <description>Code is my new favorite artistic medium. Creating art was once the only activity that put me in a flow state that was until I started coding. Programming like art is full of processes, speed bumps, errors, eustress, and joy. My skills as an artist have proven to be an asset in programming. While programming has cultivated artistic improvements.

What: More artists should learn to code.
Why: You’re skills as an artist are an asset in the programming world and vice versa programming can cultivate artistic improvements.
How: Personal Anecdote detailing skills.

      <title>Inside C++/WinRT: How does C++/WinRT represent ABI types? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200924-00/?p=104275</link>
      <description>C++/WinRT offers a high-level interface to the the low-level Windows Runtime ABI (application binary interface). It does this without any dependency on the Windows header files, which means that it needs some way to talk about the ABI types without actually using the ABI types.</description>

      <description>Language is a core component of the human condition. According to the Washington Post, at least 50% of the world’s population is bilingual. That’s a fantastic statistic, that means every second user to our application could be bilingual. Sadly, most app implementations do not support multiple languages and could be missing serving an audience.</description>

      <title>Method `.item()` for Arrays, Typed Arrays, and strings</title>
      <link>https://2ality.com/2020/09/item-method.html</link>
      <description>The ECMAScript proposal “.item()” (by Shu-yu Guo and Tab Atkins) introduces the mentioned method for indexable values (Arrays, Typed Arrays, strings). Given an index, the method returns the corresponding element. Its key benefit is that indices can be negative (-1 gets the last element, -2 the second last, etc.). This blog post examines .item() in detail.</description>

      <title>Blackfacts and the Wakanda Technology Platform - Technology By Us, for Us, About Us [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7bWu5_I-QQ</link>
      <description>The subject of 'Inclusion' in the Tech Industry is a hot topic today.

In 1990, when my employer at the time declined to offer to reimburse me for programming classes I was thinking of taking, the only thing I asked them for was to amend my employment agreement to not claim ownership of anything I built, or in other words, not get in my way.

They agreed, and I taught myself to code by reading books and launched a programming career that has now spanned close to three decades.

When I was able to quit that job a couple of years later from revenue from a product I wrote in my basement apartment, I realized the wide open opportunities available in the world of technology, and committed myself to creating technologies to help 'Bring Communities of Color Into the Information Age.'

Today, I have built a technology platform that powers my 23-years-running website Blackfacts.com, designed to provide Black schools, organizations and businesses with content and technology services on a global basis.

This talk will describe and demonstrate some of the components of the platform, called the Wakanda Technology Platform, inspired by a sub-text of the fictional nation of Wakanda, who was able to protect its culture and people because they were in possession of superior technology.

      <title>MLOps- The .Net Way with Alexander Slotte</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukdh5i6tcZE</link>
      <description>𝐌𝐋𝐎𝐩𝐬- 𝐓𝐡𝐞 .𝐍𝐞𝐭 𝐖𝐚𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐞
Automation has long been a cornerstone of modern Software Engineering and has given rise to successful initiatives such as DevOps.

Automating the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training to deployment in production, is a lot more complex and requires careful consideration of multiple axis of change, such as data, code and configuration, but can yield fantastic results when done right.

MLOps, also known as Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML), has recently gotten a lot of interest and was mentioned by ThoughtWorks as a technique worth keeping a close eye on.  

MLflow, Azure Machine Learning and AWS SageMaker are tools most commonly associated with MLOps, but did you know you can do it in .NET as well?

Join Alexander in this session where we walk through some common concepts related to MLOps, and dive into the world of ML.NET and MLOps.NET to understand how we can achieve end-to-end machine learning life-cycle automation both on-premise and in the cloud.

      <title>February 26, 2020 - Open Source Project Management and Deploying to Azure !coffee</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wghZBHLzlb4</link>
      <description>In this stream, Fritz is working through some project management tasks for the BlazorWebFormsComponents project and attempts to deploy a new collection of samples to Microsoft Azure... and it doesn't go well.

11:39 - What embarrassing things would you do for your job?
18:27 - What do I need to install for this project Jeff? I couldn't get the packages restore for the BeforeWebForms project.
20:47 - How do you go about making UI tests for something like webforms in Blazor?
37:16 - Is there a way to get the code to convert the method name into a string?
40:42 - Does JavaScript get any syntax highlighting and linting in wasm/Blazor?
44:13 - Benefit of having a separate service for calling JavaScript is that it makes it much easier to mock the interactions with javascript in tests.
51:39 - Is there any way to make it fail not-silently if the method doesn't exist?
55:20 - If you have your JavaScript method calls as configuration, then the end user can "override" them if they have specific requirements?
1:00:13 - Does this mean there is something fundamentally missing in Blazor or VS? 
1:07:30 - How much JavaScript are you planning on in this project?

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P-sgj0l7lI</link>
      <description>March is here, and Fritz starts a new themed month:  Minimal March.  All throughout the month of March he is coding with minimal hardware, minimal tools, just a text editor and a command-line to build .NET applications.  Today Fritz introduces the Chromebook Challenge and how he is using a Chromebook to write Blazor applications.

1:38:42 - Is ASP.NET Core self-hosted? 
1:42:09 - Once .NET hit version 5 will .NET Core continue?

      <title>February 28, 2020 - C#, Machine Learning, and PowerBI with Alex Davis from Madrinas</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTi40daXaV4</link>
      <description>Alex from Madrinas Coffee joins us and we learn about sentiment analysis and artificial intelligence by writing a service that analyzes Twitter for messages containing keywords and reporting the sentiment of those messages

46:41 - Where should I start if I want to learn AI?
1:14:50 - Could you enhance the model's scoring by adjusting individual scores?
1:25:01 - How difficult would it be to input more 'live' data into PowerBI? Either direct link from Twitter, or hourly updates?
1:34:50 - But seriously, how much PowerBI can be turned over to those more 'in the know', like marketing, sales, etc.?
1:59:11 - How do get the Live with the red dot on Twitter? Is that manual or StreamLabs or something else?
