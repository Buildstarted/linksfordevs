      <title>Performance (ReadOnly)List vs Immutable collection types</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/3bd2cb74-58a4-42cd-90e3-6c3a8befe854</link>
      <description>A bit back on LinkedIn, there was a discussion about read-only collection and immutability where this is not the point I want to discuss now, as I already covered that here: &amp;quot;ReadOnlyCollection is not an immutable collection&amp;quot;.
This post is just about the performance of those types compared to our baseline, the good old List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. It also explains why we see the results we see.

      <title>Rust Coreutils: Fixing Low-Hanging Performance Fruit</title>
      <link>https://jackson.dev/post/rust-coreutils-dd/</link>
      <description>September 13, 2022
I have been toying with learning Rust for the last few years, but since I wasn’t able to use it at work it never really stuck with me. Throughout my career I mainly worked on low-latency C/C++ systems, and on performance engineering work directly (benchmarking, optimization work, etc) and Rust is trying to play in the same ballpark. Since retiring at the start of this year I’ve had a little more free time, so I’ve been spending more time writing Rust code for my personal projects and trying to contribute to some Rust OSS projects to get a feel for the language.</description>

      <title>Health Checking</title>
      <link>https://blog.eightnoteight.dev/p/health-checking</link>
      <description>Systems could fail due to several unexpected failures, degraded hardware suddenly showing higher latency, partial network disruption to some specific instances, or network cable cut-off etc.,… Health checking, in principle, handles such unexpected localised failures that happen to particular containers or VMs among the entire cluster by removing them from the workload. This way total error rate in the cluster can be reduced.</description>

There ought to be something more approachable, with less equations and theory and history, with more diagrams, and including advanced topics li ...</description>
