      <title>Coffee and Open Source Conversation - Dave Grundgeiger</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JPzuCAnxtBs</link>
      <description>Based in Los Angeles, Dave has dedicated his career to solving complex technical challenges across various domains. His professional journey includes roles as Principal Software Architect at PKWARE, Senior Backend Engineer at Fetch Rewards, and Staff Software Engineer at Bold Penguin, where he consistently designed high-performance, scalable systems.

Dave's current passion project, Contextium, represents the culmination of his technical expertise and intellectual interests. This system transforms natural language into deep semantic graphs -- and vice versa -- through innovative knowledge representation techniques. Contextium employs a symbolic, rules-based approach to NLP rather than relying solely on statistical methods, allowing for precise semantic understanding and addressing critical limitations in current AI systems, for example hallucinations in large language models.

A published author with O'Reilly Media, Dave wrote 'Programming Visual Basic .NET' (2001) and 'CDO &amp; MAPI Programming with Visual Basic' (2000), demonstrating his ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly.
Over his long career, Dave has worked in many languages and tech stacks. His interests extend beyond pure engineering to theoretical aspects of AI, consciousness, and the intersection of symbolic and neural approaches to machine intelligence.

      <title>Theory in practice: Why Treating Metadata as Relations Pays Off</title>
      <link>https://ebellani.github.io/blog/2025/theory-in-practice-why-treating-metadata-as-relations-pays-off/</link>
      <description>Underpinning relational databases you find a very powerful principle: all your information should be represented as attributes drawn from domains in relations(Pascal 2020). This is Codd‚Äôs Information Principle #1. This principle isn‚Äôt just fluffy theory: it can lead to very concrete wins in how we design, query, and maintain systems.1
A practical case: Dependencies for Security Policies This is clearly a metadata question: Which other database objects does this view depend on?</description>

      <link>https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-post-developer-era/?from=newsletter</link>
      <description>When OpenAI released GPT-4 back in March 2023, they kickstarted the AI revolution. The consensus online was that front-end development jobs would be totally eliminated within a year or two.Well, it‚Äôs been more than two years since then, and I thought it was worth revisiting some of those early predictions, and seeing if we can glean any insights about where things are headed.</description>
