      <title>Lessons I learned from senior engineers</title>
      <link>https://memooo.ooo/posts/senior-engineers/</link>
      <description>“Why is this important”? Good senior engineers always ask “why” this feature, or function or even project is necessary.
Understanding “why” allows them to make decisions on “what” to do, “how” to do it and even how to take shortcuts to get there.
They also understand “why” target users would want these features in the first place.
Clear communication Good senior engineers always strive to be good communicators.
They document everything, from code to the decision making process and agreements between people involved in a project.</description>

      <title>Announcing: Learn TLA+ • Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/learntla/</link>
      <description>tl;dr: online TLA+ manual/advanced techniques/examples here.
TLA+ is a tool for testing abstract software designs. I first stumbled on it in 2016 and found it so useful I wrote a free online guide to help others learn it. Then I decided the guide wasn’t good enough and wrote Practical TLA+ in 2018. Then I decided the book wasn’t good enough and needed a second edition.
Just kidding! Book’s never getting a second edition, because it costs $26 and no matter how good I make it, it’s never going to have the reach of a free resource.</description>

      <title>CloudFormation is Dead, Long Live Terraform</title>
      <link>https://gjhr.me/2022/06/26/cloudformation-is-dead-long-live-terraform.html</link>
      <description>If CloudFormation were a person, it would be just starting secondary school, worrying about looking cool to its new friends, yet not old enough to drink or drive. If CloudFormation were a dog it would be enjoying its twilight years, lying in bed, chasing squirrels out of habit with no expectation of catching them. Unfortunately, CloudFormation is software… neglected software. CloudFormation is a draugr, a zombie, a lich. CloudFormation should have a stake thrust through its heart and its brain stem destroyed before being buried in a uranium box at the bottom of the deepest ocean.</description>
