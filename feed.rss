3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate. If you&amp;#39;re reading the bottom of a video description, I&amp;#39;m guessing you&amp;#39;re more interested than the average viewer in lessons here.

      <description>So you&amp;#39;re familiar with the idea of caching, but did you know there are 2 different ways to manage cached data. A write through cache is one such way to ensure your cache always has the most up to date data.

      <title>Radical Accountability vs Blame Culture - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=Zx6UowBuRIk</link>
      <description>Having a work environment with a safe place to fail is critical for growth and innovation.

Once we start blaming or instilling fear in people for their mistakes, you&amp;#39;ll quickly see progress grind to a halt.

What do these two different cultures look like? How can we create such a blameless environment?

Let&amp;#39;s discuss.

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

Today we focus on:
- My newsletter focused on radical accountability vs blame culture
- Jumping into articles/posts from LinkedIn &amp;amp; Reddit
- Answering YOUR questions

      <title>LIVE CODING - WordPress Migration to Blazor</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=qdZG04VuT8E</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s time! WordPress on AWS LightSail has been non-stop problems for nearly 2 years now.

Time for a change.

I&amp;#39;ll be looking into using LinkDotNet.Blog by Steven Giesel as my blog engine of choice. But migrations are never easy, so this will be the first of many sessions trying to figure out how I can get my blog setup before going live.

Remember -- I need to keep as many links active as possible so I don&amp;#39;t ruin my SEO!

      <title>Autism 101:  How My Brain Works</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=mqfpCjZqvIA</link>
      <description>What makes the autistic mind tick?  After 30 years of marriage, raising four kids, and managing the chaos of daily life, you&amp;#39;d think we’d have it all figured out by now—right? Well, it&amp;#39;s not that simple, especially when you add the challenges of living with autism into the mix. In this video, I dive into what it&amp;#39;s like navigating a relationship when you think differently, and how misunderstandings and frustrations are part of daily life. I&amp;#39;ll share some insights into mindblindness, the constant mental gymnastics of understanding neurotypical behavior, and why communication can feel like a real-life sitcom.

Whether you&amp;#39;re curious about autism or just enjoy hearing stories from real life, this episode of Dave’s Garage has something for you. If you’ve ever felt like people just don’t get you, or you&amp;#39;re trying to better understand someone on the spectrum, check it out! Plus, if you like today’s discussion, there’s more in my book, available on Amazon  https://amzn.to/3XFDfnR

      <title>Being Kind to Beginners [Planning &amp;amp; Game Design]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=R7rd4-ua2AI</link>
      <description>When playing games with other people, I make it a point to be as kind as possible to beginner-level players. Some say it&amp;#39;s impolite to hold back, but that&amp;#39;s just not true!

Some rumors have suggested that Super Smash Bros. was created as a result of the story I discuss in this episode, but I can confirm that&amp;#39;s not the case. This experience had no influence on the concept behind Smash Bros.</description>

      <description>What do all game directors have in common?
Not much, it turns out. But the one thing I can think of happens to tie into exactly why they have so little in common.</description>

      <description>Many games rely on repeating the same gameplay, which naturally leads to simplistic and repetitive sequences. Fetch quests are one such example.
In this video, I&amp;#39;ll explore a few ways you can make these straightforward errands more fun.</description>

      <description>Games are made up of sets of numbers, but it&amp;#39;s up to their creators to decide what feelings those numbers convey. Like graphics and sound, game parameters are a kind of art, so we want them to be memorable.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been wrapped up in video games for a long time, so I&amp;#39;m familiar with games of both the past and present.

There&amp;#39;s no point in just dwelling on the old days, but at the same time, we wouldn&amp;#39;t be where we are now without our past accomplishments.</description>

      <description>The center point in a game is the spot the camera is focused on. It&amp;#39;s always there, but you can&amp;#39;t actually see it.
While the center point generally follows the player character, it shouldn&amp;#39;t anchor to them. Why is that?</description>

      <title>Mya Matos - Between Two Worlds</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=tyk2T1NVISQ</link>
      <description>We have all heard the expression “bring your full authentic self to work.” You may have seen it exemplified by your counterparts. But do you get the feeling that bringing your full and authentic self means to be ostracized rather than celebrated or accepted?

Learn from tech professionals who identify with various URMs ways to show up more authentically at work. Share in their experiences and learn how to tackle the challenges of showing up authentically at work. We will discuss:

The cost of showing up authentically at work
Joys of showing up authentically at work
Tips for engaging your team and management in this conversation

As a URM, I have experienced being in spaces where I felt my experience was dramatically different from my counterparts. A lot of us are living double “authentic lives” having to carefully craft and curate a work persona that is palatable in order to fit in. This can have a negative impact on our mental health. Let’s discuss the pros and cons and dismantle this challenge together.

      <title>Wesley Faulkner - Getting through the awkwardness of networking</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=XJowVFiOFx4</link>
      <description>There have been things that I wasn&amp;#39;t taught growing up because it was assumed obvious and that I would pick it up naturally. As a neurodiverse person, I have had to work hard to appear to do things effortlessly. Networking is one of the skills I have learned from trial and error, and I want to teach you how to navigate new environments and converse with all kinds of people. If you&amp;#39;ve tried learning from movies and self-help books and that hasn&amp;#39;t worked, there&amp;#39;s a reason. There&amp;#39;s a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. If you want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it&amp;#39;s still hard to find people to talk to and start a conversation. I&amp;#39;ll give you real tips that will help you work through these issues.

Wesley Faulkner is a first-generation American. He is a founding member of the government transparency group Open Austin and ran for Austin City Council in 2016. His professional experience also includes work as a social media and community manager for the software company Atlassian, and various roles for the computer processor company AMD, Dell, and IBM. Wesley Faulkner serves as a board member for South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) and specializes in Developer Relations.</description>

      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=QgkLrqGrwy4</link>
      <description>I sometimes see proposals that hedge their bets, suggesting both a Plan A and a Plan B for accomplishing their goals.
This should be avoided at all costs. Stick to the one plan you think is best!</description>

      <description>The system I&amp;#39;m introducing today keeps team members in meetings a bit longer, but its pros far outweigh that one con. Remember: managing a team means also factoring in the cost of keeping everyone on the same page!
FWIW, our team liked this system, too.</description>

      <title>C# 9.0: Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=9lvx6mzCAE4</link>
      <description>Curious about C# 9.0? 

In this video we are exploring pattern matching in C#. This is a great addition to the C# language and is something I&amp;#39;ve personally been using in other programming languages!

With C# 9.0 pattern matching has been improved to add more patterns. We now have the following additional patterns:

1. Type patterns
2. Conjunctive and patterns
3. Disjunctive or patterns
4. Negated not patterns
5. Parenthesized patterns
6. Relational patterns

Learn more about the news in C# 9.0 at the Microsoft Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9

DragonFire is a high-powered laser weapon designed to take down drones. Why? The problem with drone warfare is that drones are a lot cheaper than the missiles used to defend against them. This laser weapon changes that.

      <description>Today, I&amp;#39;ll talk about the need for leniency on the part of game developers. Making games means making rules, but sometimes it can be more fun if we allow the player to bend them in their favor.
Of course, cheating in competitive games is unacceptable.</description>

      <title>Leslie Chapman - Don&amp;#39;t Let Your Tech Grow Up to be Biased</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=R5Wti0DT4z8</link>
      <description>Did you know that automatic soap dispensers sometimes can’t recognize a hand with dark skin? Did you know that self driving cars sometimes can’t either? In this session, Leslie will cover a history of biased technologies and talk about what we can do now to stop designing and teaching our tech to have the same biases that humans do. Whether you are a designer, manager, or developer there are strategies we can all employ to make the future more inclusive.

      <title>Competing with the Past [Grab Bag]</title>

      <description>With all the subscription services available nowadays, consumers have a tremendous amount of media available at their fingertips.

      <description>Scaling refers to changing the size of an object or polygon. While it&amp;#39;s used less often than rotation and translation, employing it effectively can dramatically alter an object&amp;#39;s feel.</description>

      <description>Do graphics affect how much fun a game is? I probably give the impression of a game-essence advocate, so you might expect me to answer &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to that...
But far from it! Graphics are very important to how fun games are!</description>

      <title>The Potential of One Button  [Planning &amp;amp; Game Design]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=tafG03n89MY</link>
      <description>The simplest approach to a game&amp;#39;s controls is to distill them down to a single button! But let&amp;#39;s not let simplicity lead to sloppiness. I think it&amp;#39;s important to differentiate the different gameplay styles, for starters.

Note: I’ve noticed that numerous comments have mentioned games that use a directional pad or analog stick together with a button, but in this episode, I’m focusing exclusively on games that literally only use a single button.</description>

      <description>Social media may be more popular these days, but it&amp;#39;s hard to top a website as the central hub for info about a game.
Today I&amp;#39;ll lean on my Smash website experiences to share why I&amp;#39;m so particular about how information is presented.</description>

      <title>Dying Comes as a Relief?  [Game Essence]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=vDEJ0sXw8Ks</link>
      <description>A study found that players feel anxiety after defeating an opponent, and relief when they themselves are defeated. You&amp;#39;d expect it would be the opposite, right?</description>

      <title>Kirby Air Ride  [Game Concepts]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=bRDAYgRns4E</link>
      <description>Kirby Air Ride was actually my first time making consecutive games on a single console!

At this point, I was doing supervising work for numerous projects including the Kirby anime series, so why did I go back to being a director? I&amp;#39;ll touch on that, the concept behind the game, and the struggles we faced in this episode.

By the way, I went independent after finishing my work on Kirby Air Ride.</description>

      <description>Imagine watching a DVD or streaming service that didn&amp;#39;t let you pause, skip ahead, or rewind.
Though developers have their reasons for how they implement cutscenes, I&amp;#39;d really like to see the same sort of freedom there.</description>

      <description>In competitive scenes, it&amp;#39;s expected for each player&amp;#39;s skill to be directly reflected—but not all games need to be so intense.
For more casual games that will be enjoyed by a wider audience, you&amp;#39;ll need a system for implementing handicap settings.</description>

      <title>Leslie Chapman - Show Me Your Error Screens</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=iRmehTs7pgY</link>
      <description>Showing a user an error while they are using your software is inevitable, so why not re-think errors? Leslie is going to walk though some examples where errors screens became fun, and when a little bit of forethought could even make the dreaded error screen avoidable. Let’s talk about failure-driven design, and making boring terminal error screens a thing of the past.

      <description>The CG models we make for games don&amp;#39;t come with a built-in sense of scale. Whether they&amp;#39;re giant-sized or the size of a tiny plastic model, if it&amp;#39;s the same shape, it&amp;#39;s the same object. Because of this, you need to do what you can to make them feel like they belong in your game world.</description>

      <title>Portraying Fingers [Animation]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=nCvdmQKrjf8</link>
      <description>When working with animation, it&amp;#39;s important to consider how to portray fingers. Though they&amp;#39;re small, animating them demands quite a lot of processing power, so we often need to find clever workarounds when possible.</description>

      <title>C# Nullable reference types – No more null reference exceptions!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=NDweaZZZcbc</link>
      <description>Are you tired of null reference exceptions and unexpected crashes due to uninitialized variables? There’s a very handy feature in C# called nullable references types that will help you catch this before it becomes a problem!

In this video we are exploring nullable reference types in C#. This is a great addition to the C# language!

This language feature was first introduced in C# 8.0 and is a great way to find potential problems, before it becomes an issue!

Enable nullable reference types in your project by modifying the csproj file.

This video also includes details on how to use the C# 9.0 language features &amp;#39;new expression&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;init only setters&amp;#39;.

      <title>Run Local LLMs on Hardware from $50 to $50,000 - We Test and Compare!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=mUGsv_IHT-g</link>
      <description>Dave tests llama3.1 and llama3.2 using Ollama on a Raspberry Pi, a Herk Orion Mini PC, a 3970X, an M2 Mac Pro, and a 7995WX featuring the NVidia 6000 Ada GPU.  See the results live!  Check out my book on the autism spectrum!  https://amzn.to/4elzfQv

I’m doing something that’s never been done before: we’re going to run a ChatGPT-style large language model locally on a wide range of hardware, from a $50 Raspberry Pi 4 all the way up to a $50,000 Dell AI workstation with dual Nvidia 6000 Ada cards.

If you saw my last video, you know I caught some heat for using top-tier hardware and running everything in WSL on Windows. This time, I’m doing things differently. We’re starting small and budget-friendly—no Linux shenanigans—and testing out local inference on everything from a Pi to a high-performance mini PC, a gaming rig, an M2 Mac Pro, and, of course, that beast of a Dell workstation.  

Along the way, I’ll show you how to install Ollama on Windows, and we’ll compare how well each machine can handle models like Llama 3.1 and even the monstrous 405-billion parameter model. Which system will shine? Which one will falter? Can a Raspberry Pi even handle a large language model at all? And what happens when we push the $50,000 workstation to its limit?

If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to run a large language model locally, or just want to see how different hardware stacks up, this episode is for you! Be sure to stick around to the end for some surprising results.

&amp;#128187; Hardware tested in this episode:

Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM)
Orion Herk Mini PC (Ryzen 9 7940HS)
Desktop Gaming PC (Threadripper 3970X &amp;amp; Nvidia 4080)
Apple M2 Mac Pro
Dell Threadripper Workstation (96 cores &amp;amp; Nvidia 6000 Ada)

      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=HVktK4a9Yfo</link>
      <description>Super Smash Bros. is all about knockback, so the knockback systems are very detailed. It&amp;#39;s been like this since the first game.
In today&amp;#39;s Programming &amp;amp; Tech video, I&amp;#39;d like to take the opportunity to introduce some of those systems.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;#39;s Game Essence video, I&amp;#39;ll be discussing a way characters often end up getting balanced: by rounding off both strengths and weaknesses.
While that process certainly can resolve issues, it&amp;#39;s hard to say it makes a game more fun...</description>

      <title>Jay Miller - But Look at the Numbers: Using Public Data to Highlight Systemic Problems</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=WDGs7L-lZks</link>
      <description>After the tumultuous year 2020 was, I set out to have conversations with folks about how there were issues that wouldn&amp;#39;t be solved with a single action. To many ideas of racism and over-policing are viewed in the lens of their local area.

I show in this talk how I found out about the Racial Identification and Profiling Act in California and the Washington Post Police Shootings data. Then by storing this data in Elasticsearch using Python, Pandas, and Eland, I was able to visualize data to uncover some noticeable issues in police stops and police involved shootings.

      <title>Presenting Scores [Planning &amp;amp; Design]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=FeekeBW26AI</link>
      <description>In the past, score systems were a must-have for games—but these days, simply playing for points isn&amp;#39;t enough to captivate players.

      <title>Making Effects the Right Size [Effects]</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=rXwo0qcKJDk</link>
      <description>Effects lack physical presence and are regulated by time, so their density is extremely important!
This principle is true for graphics in general, but today, I&amp;#39;ll be discussing the sense of scale for unique effects.</description>

Using dark mode can negatively impact your cognative performance. You&amp;#39;ll read slower and you will spot fewer spelling mistakes. Better switch to light mode when it matters!

      <description>In this UI video, I&amp;#39;d like to introduce an alternative to the simple list format commonly used for menu layouts.
In practice, your UI&amp;#39;s design will differ depending on the aims of your game, but I personally prefer a menu you can navigate without even reading the words, once you get used to it.</description>

Before alarm clocks existed, knocker-uppers had the job of waking people up for work. They would go around with heavy stick and knock on their clients&amp;#39; doors or windows to wake them up for work. In return, the knocker-uppers were paid a few cents a week.

      <title>Kernel Mode vs User Mode: Why it Matters, What You Need to Know</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=GB7JTXeGcs0</link>
      <description>Retired Windows developer Dave Plummer dives deep into one of the most critical aspects of operating systems: Kernel Mode. We’ll explore how vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown impacted system performance and why kernel mode is crucial for security and stability. From real-world disasters like the Crowdstrike outage to the differences between Windows and Linux kernel structures, this episode covers how your OS balances power and risk. Plus, we’ll explain why anti-cheat systems or bad drivers can cause your favorite game to lag.

While there&amp;#39;s merit to starting out slow and building up the story, it&amp;#39;s more suitable these days to cut straight to the action.</description>

      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=44ONFHla-sw</link>
      <description>Super Smash Bros. is a game where typical rewards don&amp;#39;t entirely make sense, since fighters can&amp;#39;t level up or earn new equipment.
However, not having rewards at all wouldn&amp;#39;t feel very satisfying, so we did our best to compensate players in a few different ways.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Development with Xamarin</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=VeDZ0Jl8yMs</link>
      <description>The objectives for this tutorial is to give you an understanding of how to target multiple platforms when using Xamarin.

The whole idea of using Xamarin is that we can reach all the major platforms with one code base.

In this tutorial we will look at the different ways to share code among different platforms and some of the strategies that we can conform to in order to make life easier for us.

We will look at:
* How to create and use a Shared Library and how to leverage 

* NuGet packages referenced in our platform specific projects

* How to create and use a Portable Class Library and how it differs from a Shared Library

* How to use the Xamarin Components</description>

      <description>Games that greatly penalize the player each time they&amp;#39;re defeated are on the rise. Roguelikes are a prime example.
This is fine for games players are meant to play over and over again, but whether they&amp;#39;ll actually -want- to play is another question.</description>

      <description>AMStack has become one of the prominent web technologies in recent years. These frameworks offer faster websites, make them more scalable, and more secure. This has changed the front-end by serving static pages that can be fetched from a server.

But what if you need to attach a database to your JAMStack app? Using React, Prisma, and GraphQL, you can make a full-stack application based on JAMStack principles with the Redwood. By the end of this talk, we&amp;#39;ll have a dashboard app that is connected to a database with a fully functional GraphQL server.

      <description>I think the game essence in old-school 2D shoot &amp;#39;em ups should be pretty easy to understand...but let&amp;#39;s take a look at their push and pull to find out!</description>

      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=99gdMDF7V2E</link>
      <description>Of all the different poses, attack poses are quite possibly the most vital. If they don&amp;#39;t come across well, your whole game will suffer!
Today, I&amp;#39;d like to share some of the things I kept in mind with these poses while working on Smash Bros.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been told it&amp;#39;s an unusual skill, but the ability to count frames—even just approximately—can really come in handy when making games, since they control the flow of time.
In this video, I&amp;#39;ll show you a few tricks that might help you do it yourself!

The first webcam was pointed at a coffee pot at the University of Cambridge in 1991. It allowed people in the building to see if there was coffee in the pot or not. Preventing them from making unnecessary trips to the kitchen.

This is the story of the Trojan Room coffee pot. An early internet celebrity.

      <description>These days, a great number of people are involved in adjusting a game&amp;#39;s balance, so being able to change parameters on the fly is vital.

This might be difficult to explain without showing the tools we use, but I&amp;#39;ll do my best to keep things simple.</description>

      <description>My advice today doesn&amp;#39;t apply only to game creators—everyone can benefit from taking it to heart.
