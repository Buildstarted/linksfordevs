      <title>andrewducker | A modest proposal on avoiding massive international computer failures</title>
      <link>https://andrewducker.dreamwidth.org/4454104.html</link>
      <description>I propose that if you supply software to more than X customers (say 10,000 but I&amp;#39;m totally open to discussion on this point) then you must have insurance that covers you for legal liability for damages.</description>

      <title>Interface design in the age of qualiatech: Do you want to be a button?</title>
      <link>https://smoothbrains.net/posts/2024-07-19-qualiatech.html</link>
      <description>There have been many times in my life that I have felt at one with a computer screen, but one in particular stands out – when I discovered something called Max/MSP during one of my second-year classes at university. Max/MSP is a visual programming language, where instead of writing a program by typing text into a text editor, the programmer manipulates a directed acyclic graph of nodes on a canvas. Generally this is used for novel realtime audio/video production.</description>

      <title>Carving ELF Files</title>
      <link>https://blog.nietaanraken.nl/posts/elf-file-size/</link>
      <description>Recently, I created a simple tool, Carve Exe, to carve executables from other files (e.g. memory dumps or network traffic). Carving executables from binary blobs is a common task in digital forensics and reverse engineering. For example, when analyzing how a malware sample unpacks and deobfuscates itself.</description>

involve a lot more recurring expense. For that and other reasons, I want to see

      <description>Earlier this year, both major Web engines (WebKit/Safari and Chromium/Chrome/Edge/Brave) accelerated HTML parsing using SIMD instructions. These ‘SIMD’ instructions are special instructions that are present in all our processors that can process multiple bytes at once (e.g., 16 bytes).</description>

      <title>Why disallow package within the class name?</title>
      <link>https://garrettdbates.com/blog/software-architecture/why-disallow-package-within-the-class-name</link>
      <description>Motivation After opening a directory it is the developers job to filter out the files that are not relevant to their task at hand. The more words to filter, the more difficult it becomes to quickly orient themselves and start making changes. Disallowing package within the class name promises to reduce this information overload.</description>

      <description>Status Quo There is significant artistic variance on how to craft tests which provide developers quick and useful feedback. A common point of contention is the number of files which should be included within these quick and useful tests. The most popular strategy is to have a single file under test at a time.</description>
