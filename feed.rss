      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/495/cryptographic-signatures-surprising-pitfalls-and-letsencrypt/</link>
      <description>The Let's Encrypt Accident
On August 11th, 2015, Andrew Ayer posted the following email to the IETF mailing list:

I recently reviewed draft-barnes-acme-04 and found vulnerabilities in
the DNS, DVSNI, and Simple HTTP challenges that would allow an attacker
to fraudulently complete these challenges.

(The author has since then written a more complete explanation of the attack.)

      <title>Jim Scheinman TED Talk: The Amazing true story of Galen Clark, the "Father of Yosemite"</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpccXl_B6Fs</link>
      <description>In this short TED Talk, Jim discusses the true meaning of finding one's passion and leaving one's legacy by weaving in the incredible untold true story of one of the key 'founders' of Yosemite, Galen Clark, an early pioneer and failed entrepreneur, who contracted tuberculosis while mining for gold and was told he had only months to live, yet who lived to 96 and is a key reason that we have the beauty of Yosemite to cherish today.  
Enjoy the journey and celebration of this soft-spoken true American hero, Galen Clark, as we celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Yosemite as National Treasure!</description>
