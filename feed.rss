      <title>Engineering Memory</title>
      <link>https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2024/12/21/engineering-memory/</link>
      <description>About three years ago, I memorized the first one hundred digits of pi. I did it on a lark, after reading Joshua Foer’s Moonwalking with Einstein. The book’s
central claim is that nearly anyone can achieve seemingly super-human feats of
memory with proper technique and deliberate
practice. Intrigued, I put the some of the
techniques to the test and found that they worked surprisingly well. But they
did not just work. They converted the hard and shapeless problem of how to
remember into a problem of discipline and methodology. Remembering became engineering.</description>

      <title>Cancer Treatment on a Budget | Lorenzo Venneri</title>
      <link>https://lvenneri.com/blog/alt_cancer</link>
      <description>These are low cost, first principles methods to help treat cancer. They are aimed at the poor and desperate, but some also serve as preventative measures for normal healthy people. I was inspired to put it together after hearing about a friend&amp;#39;s dad (neuro surgeon who said &amp;quot;chemo is scam&amp;quot;) who had a miraculous PSA 5 prostrate cancer recovery and various cancer cases from  friends and family. I’ve also become interested in parasites and their obscure effects on people’s health and I think there could be connections. Keep in mind, that the last biology course I took was in high school, and I am ignorant about the underlying chemico biological mechanisms at play here. But I can read and try to chart a course based on things that make intuitive sense.  None of these ideas are my ideas, and I&amp;#39;ve tried to put a few references where I remember them.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch is Dead, Long Live Lexical Search - Milvus Blog</title>
      <link>https://milvus.io/blog/elasticsearch-is-dead-long-live-lexical-search.md</link>
      <description>By now, everyone knows that hybrid search has improved RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search quality. While dense embedding search has shown impressive capabilities in capturing deep semantic relationships between queries and documents, it still has notable limitations. These include a lack of explainability and suboptimal performance with long-tail queries and rare terms.</description>

      <title>Why Nix Is the Perfect Package Manager for Your Steam Deck</title>
      <link>https://rasmuskirk.com/articles/2024-12-23_why-nix-is-the-perfect-package-manager-for-your-steam-deck/</link>
      <description>In this article I’d like to show
                                    how to get Nix working on your Steam
                                    Deck and explain why you might want
                                    to. Firstly, you need to install
                                    Nix. I’ve seen a lot of people
                                    struggling using the official Nix
                                    installer, this
                                    guide for example takes a lot of
                                    steps for something that really
                                    ought to be a single command.
                                    Luckily, the wonderful folks at Determinate
                                    Systems have made a more
                                    versatile Nix
                                    installer that works wonderfully
                                    on the Steam Deck.</description>

      <title>Intercepting Websocket Messages To Analyze Geoguessr Party Games</title>
      <link>https://demaga.github.io/2024/12/16/intercepting-websocket-messages-to-analyze-geoguessr-party-games.html</link>
      <description>My friends and I play GeoGuessr every Wednesday. It’s a small yet awesome tradition of ours, a reason to get together on Discord every week. Being a naturally curious person, I had a lot of questions to ask. What is our top score? How often do we confuse UK with New Zealand? Do we ever get Ukraine wrong? Imagine my disappointment, when I realized that GeoGuessr provides neither such stats, nor any kind of records of our games. So I had to collect this data myself.</description>

      <title>I sell sweet potatoes on the internet</title>
      <link>https://www.sammcalilly.com/writing/2024/12/23/i-sell-sweet-potatoes-on-the-internet.html</link>
      <description>I was homesick alone for Thanksgiving and always trying to think up ways to make more money. I decided to copy the Vidalia Onions guy by selling Mississippi Sweet Potatoes directly to consumers online. I read his blog post “I sell onions on the internet” several years ago and have always wondered if I could do that with Mississippi Sweet Potatoes. So I spent my lonesome holiday creating a website and running a Google Ad campaign to see if there was anybody who wants to buy sweet potatoes online.</description>

      <title>Structured Extraction with LLM</title>
      <link>https://kevin3010.github.io/openai/llm/genai/2024/12/07/Strucutured-Extraction.html</link>
      <description>I have been exploring the capabilities of structured generation with OpenAI models for a long time, starting from when function calling was introduced. I believe structured generation is a powerful use case for LLMs. The reason is that if we can extract information already present in data and give it a structured format, we can enable significant automation.</description>

      <link>https://kyunghyuncho.me/i-sensed-anxiety-and-frustration-at-neurips24/</link>
      <description>last week at NeurIPS’24, one extremely salient thing was the anxiety and frustration felt and expressed by late-year PhD students and postdocs who were confused by the job market that looks and feels so much different from what they expected perhaps when they were applying for PhD programs five or so years ago. and, some of these PhD students and postdocs are my own under my supervision. this makes me reflect upon what is going on or what has been going on in artificial intelligence research and development. this post will be more of less a stream of thoughts rather than a well-structured piece (though, as if i ever wrote a well-structured, well-thought-out, well-prepared blog post.)</description>

      <description>As an active user of npm and an author/maintainer of several libraries, I’ve recently encountered significant problems with npm’s new search experience. While I appreciate the effort the npm team has put into improving search, the current implementation has introduced serious issues that negatively impact discoverability and usefulness.</description>

      <title>&amp;quot;Do you know who I am&amp;quot; calculator</title>
      <link>https://html.non.io/do-you-know-who-I-am/</link>
      <description>A weird thing happened when I joined Figma. 
            I ended up getting a lot1 of followers on Twitter.  Prior to my time there I had around 100 followers, and was mostly shitposting to empty air.
            I now have 6.9k followers (huge, I know - you must be very impressed), but admittedly almost all of this is just because of my position at Figma. 
            Regardless of the reason, at some point I started tracking this number and placing arbitrary value on it. 
            I&amp;#39;d find myself at cons being like, &amp;quot;wow this dude has 50k followers, they must be important&amp;quot;.</description>
