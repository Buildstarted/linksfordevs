      <title>Feature Flags in a CI Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://andydote.co.uk/2023/01/16/feature-flags-ci/</link>
      <description>Feature flags are a great tool for helping software development; they provide controlled feature rollouts, facilitate A/B testing, and help decouple deployment from release. So when it comes to building our software, why do we treat the CI pipeline without the same level of engineering as the production code?
So, why not use feature flags in your CI pipeline?
TLDR Reduce the risk of breaking a CI pipeline for all of a project’s developers by using the flagon CLI to query Feature Flags, opting developers into and out of new CI features and processes by targeting groups of developers or branch naming patterns.</description>

      <title>Screenshots as the Universal API</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/screenshots-as-the-universal-api</link>
      <description>With advancements in machine learning, screenshots are quickly becoming a universal data format. It&amp;#39;s now (relatively) easy to extract meaning (image-to-text), layout information (object recognition), text (optical character recognition, OCR), &amp;#160;and other metadata (formatting, fonts, etc.).

Now, with diffusion-based models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, we have an encoder – text-to-image.

Screenshots-as-API solves a few problems:

      <title>Cruel optimism (and lazy pessimism)</title>
      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/cruel-optimism/</link>
      <description>Do you remember the avocado toast guy? I read Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus recently (you should read it, it’s great), and I learned that someone1 has come up with a name for this sort of modern reinterpretation of “let them eat cake”: cruel optimism.
Cruel optimism, the way Hari interprets it2, boils down to the folly of suggesting personal solutions to systemic problems. It’s about advice given from a position of privilege to people who will never be able to apply it to their own lives–because the cards are stacked so unfairly against them–but who will nonetheless interpret their failure as a personal one.</description>

      <title>What’s the right UX for an expired certificate?</title>
      <link>https://emilymstark.com/2023/01/16/whats-the-right-ux-for-an-expired-certificate.html</link>
      <description>Every once in a while, I encounter some variation of the following question: how can a TLS certificate go from perfectly acceptable one day to completely insecure the next? In other words, why does the browser show a scary full-page warning for a certificate that expired one day, or even one hour, ago – the same as a certificate that is self-signed, chains to an unknown root, or presents the wrong name? The premise behind these questions is that an expired certificate (especially one that is recently expired) is not as bad as a certificate with some other type of validation error, and thus the warning UX shouldn’t be as severe.</description>
