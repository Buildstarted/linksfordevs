      <title>This open problem taught me what topology is</title>

Instead of sponsored ad reads, these lessons are funded directly by viewers: https://3b1b.co/support
An equally valuable form of support is to simply share the videos.

This argument was originally by Herbert Vaughan, appearing for examples in this issue of the Topology Proceedings.

3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate. If you&amp;#39;re reading the bottom of a video description, I&amp;#39;m guessing you&amp;#39;re more interested than the average viewer in lessons here. It would mean a lot to me if you chose to stay up to date on new ones, either by subscribing here on YouTube or otherwise following on whichever platform below you check most regularly.

      <title>Ways to use torch.export : ezyang’s blog</title>
      <link>http://blog.ezyang.com/2024/12/ways-to-use-torch-export/</link>
      <description>Previously, I discussed the value proposition of torch.compile.  While doing so, I observed a number of downsides (long compile time, complicated operational model, lack of packaging) that were intrinsic to torch.compile&amp;#39;s API contract, which emphasized being able to work on Python code as is, with minimal intervention from users.  torch.export occupies a different spot in the tradeoff space: in exchange for more upfront work making a model exportable, it allows for use of PyTorch models in environments where using torch.compile as is would be impossible.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Execution by Overloading __bool__</title>
      <link>https://www.philipzucker.com/overload_bool/</link>
      <description>A few months ago I saw a talk on buildit, https://buildit.so/ a really neat project that achieves staged metaprogramming as a C++ library. I love the central tenets of being in a mainstream language and not requiring a modified compiler. Right on, brother. One thing I came away with was a neat trick for getting non-overloadable syntax to be overloadable.</description>

      <title>a society-level forever clinical trial – Kyunghyun Cho</title>
      <link>https://kyunghyuncho.me/an-outrageous-idea-a-society-level-forever-clinical-trial/</link>
      <description>when i got tenure earlier, i thought that would change how i work and live. it was true, but it wasn’t because of tenure but because of my thyroid cancer (see https://kyunghyuncho.me/sharing-some-good-news-and-some-bad-news/ if you’re curious.) when i was promoted to become a full professor, i thought that would change how i work and live, but to be frank, it didn’t. though, i started to think about what i should be able to think about, now that i have become a full professor with tenure, implying (at least in my mind) that i have an obligation not only to carry on as usual but also to think out of box. for the past year and counting, this has been inconvenient because my status quo isn’t bad at all but also interesting because i feel like i am perhaps at the right stage of my career to not only think carefully but also think somewhat outrageously (though, to be strict, whatever i think of or execute tends to be too little and often too late always.) anyhow, i thought i’d share one such thought an airport (SFO) while waiting to board my flight in … let’s see .. 25 minutes.</description>

      <title>Charity Calculator</title>
      <link>https://lucaspauker.com/articles/charity-calculator/</link>
      <description>Introduction With holiday season in full swing, people may be more enticed to give to charity. However, there is a question of how to optimize your charitable donations. Specifically, I would like to optimize charitable donations for maximum impact. It seems to me that there are two parts to this equation:
Which charity(ies)/cause(s) should I give to How much should I give? The answer to the first question is deeply personal, so I want to focus on the second question.</description>
