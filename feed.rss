      <title>The Open Web Dies When We Give Up</title>
      <link>https://blog.antonlydike.de/The%20Open%20Web%20Dies%20When%20We%20Give%20Up.html</link>
      <description>I keep reading this thing, repeated as if it's fact: "The Open Web is Dead". At first I agreed, maybe because I also felt bummed out by what's happening, but I have since come 180¬∞ on this viewpoint. The Open Web cannot die. As long as there is one person believing in it, it will be there. It's not a thing that you can "turn it off", "fence it in", "exclude it", or whatever else you want to say. The Open Web is what you, as the user, do with it. It will only die if we stop believing.</description>

      <title>Babies and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://blog.karliner.net/posts/babies-and-llms/</link>
      <description>Last week, I spent some time with Haley (one year old) doing serious research into ‚Äòputting things into other things‚Äô.
We‚Äôd brought her a soft toy squirrel and, inevitably, she had found the cardboard box it came in much more interesting. There followed a considerable period of putting various objects into the box and taking them out again. This was pretty interesting, but the discovery that closing the box made the items disappear was even more fascinating.</description>

      <description>Started by [[Niklas Luhmann]], also called ‚ÄúSlip Box‚Äù. This approach will further dilute the idea of a librarian who organizes books in main categories and sub-folder and focuses only on the thought at hand as an individual note. Instead of spending lots of your brainpower on which folder to put a specific note in, you start creating it in one folder for all and linking them together. Usually, you wouldn‚Äôt have any structure in these concepts, but I combined the two methods into my Second Brain. You also see in the above design under üí° Resources/üóÉ Zettelkasten I have its folder.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve long been interested in new and different platforms.  I ran Debian on an Alpha back in the late 1990s and was part of the Alpha port team; then I helped bootstrap Debian on amd64.  I‚Äôve got somewhere around 8 Raspberry Pi devices in active use right now, and the free NNCPNET Internet email service I manage runs on an ARM instance at a cloud provider.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on how to disagree</title>
      <link>https://johnsillings.com/2025/09/11/thoughts-on-how-to-disagree.html</link>
      <description>Back in the day, I was on my school‚Äôs debate team.

It was basically a sport for nerds. (In hindsight, my friend group did a lot of ‚Äúsports for nerds‚Äù activities: chess, quiz bowl, competitive gaming, etc.)

Anyway, back to the debate team. We treated it like a sport. We trained for it and attended competitions. It was a lot of fun ‚Äì but deep down, we were there to win.

A stronger, better-researched, more clearly articulated argument was the big key to winning (obvious).

But there were lots of other ways to score points:


  by flustering your opponent with a hard question,
  catching them off-guard,
  pointing out something silly they said,
  and so on.


This is how most people think about debating, whether it‚Äôs on social media or between political candidates. It is eristic (about ‚Äúwinning‚Äù).

Obviously, this is a popular form of entertainment. We enjoy the drama. We like seeing other people (particularly those we disagree with) get ‚Äúowned‚Äù / ‚Äúdunked on‚Äù / ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù / etc.

What sucks about this is how shallow it is.

Mostly in academic circles, there is a less popular and considerably less entertaining form of debate. It is dialectic (about learning through disagreement).

The ground-rules are different:


  
    You are charitable. You interpret your opponent‚Äôs argument in a strong way, not a weak way.
  
  
    You look for common ground. If you find yourself agreeing on something ‚Äì however small ‚Äì you build from there.
  
  
    You put your ego aside. Being wrong is not a bad thing; it means you‚Äôre learning something new.
  


In a narrow, self-serving sense, there‚Äôs obviously a lot of value in being persuasive. But in aggregate, it‚Äôs a lot more exciting to actually be right vs. simply being perceived that way.

This post, and particularly its title, was inspired by this excellent essay by Paul Graham.

      <description>Social Signaling is the idea that people, through actions or even words, may be trying to get others to believe something about them. A simple example might be trying to signal you are smart by using big words. Or conversely, trying to signal you‚Äôre a chill bro‚Ñ¢ by using all those latest slang words and memes. Or signal you‚Äôre rich by purchasing a certain item.</description>

      <description>Interesting: a Danish supermarket chain is setting up "Emergency Stores" that can keep open for up to three days without power or telecom and store an expanded stock of non-perishable food and essentials.
The idea is that no one should be more than 50 km from such a store and it should prevent hoarding/panic buying as people will know basic food will be available in an emergency. 
Should be rolled out in 2028 at the latest.
