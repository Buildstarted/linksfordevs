      <title>The Philosophy of Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/</link>
      <description>The philosophy of computer science is concerned with those
ontological, methodological, and ethical issues that arise from within
the academic discipline of computer science as well as from the
practice of software development. Thus, the philosophy of computer
science shares the same philosophical goals as the philosophy of
mathematics and the many subfields of the philosophy of science, such
as the philosophy of biology or the philosophy of the social sciences.
The philosophy of computer science also considers the analysis of
computational artifacts, that is, human-made
computing systems, and it focuses on methods involved in the design,
specification, programming, verification, implementation, and testing
of those systems. The abstract nature of computer programs and the
resulting complexity of implemented artifacts, coupled with the
technological ambitions of computer science, ensures that many of the
conceptual questions of the philosophy of computer science have
analogues in the
 philosophy of mathematics,
 the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the
 philosophy of technology.
 Other issues characterize the philosophy of computer science only. We
shall concentrate on three tightly related groups of topics that form
the spine of the subject. First we discuss topics related to the
ontological analysis of computational artifacts, in Sections 1–5
below. Second, we discuss topics involved in the methodology and
epistemology of software development, in Sections 6–9 below.
Third, we discuss ethical issues arising from computer science
practice, in Section 10 below. Applications of computer science are
briefly considered in section 11.</description>

      <title>Coding The Road Runner Loop Meme</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/coding-the-road-runner-while-loop-meme</link>
      <description>There’s a programming meme featuring the Looney Tunes characters of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. These characters are locked in a never-ending chase, where the Coyote seems to come close, but not quite catch the speedy bird. In the meme itself, it shows the Coyote running off of a cliff due to his misuse of the do / while iteration construct, whereas the Road Runner stops short because he presumably used the while iteration construct.</description>
