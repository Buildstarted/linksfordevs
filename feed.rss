We&amp;#39;ll look at the WebView and it&amp;#39;s printing functionality and some of the intricacies that are involved in hosting the WebView control outside of a desktop application context to provide unattended mode even in service context.</description>

      <title>Finding NetBSD Kernel Bugs through LockDoc</title>
      <link>https://scholz.ruhr/blog/finding-netbsd-locking-bugs/</link>
      <description>This post will be my attempt to package up my master’s thesis in a format that can be read comfortably. I’ve spent the last 15 months mostly on this topic, and if you’ve noticed that some of my past posts mostly revolved around NetBSD, this is why. I hope this also gives me the opportunity to shine a light on some implementation details, since the thesis itself had to be mostly focused on the academic stuff.</description>

      <title>Extolling the Virtues of Dexie Cloud for Backendless Development</title>
      <link>https://dusty.phillips.codes/2024/03/27/extolling-the-virtues-of-dexie-cloud-for-backendless-development/</link>
      <description>Dexie Cloud was released publicly today, and I love this
product so much that I want to lend my voice to the marketing effort.
Dexie.js is an incredible library for interacting with
IndexedDB in the browser. It wraps the sometimes-obtuse (and oft-buggy)
IndexedDB APIs with much more developer-friendly interfaces. And it is fully
reactive; if you change something in the database, your React, Svelte, Vue,
Angular, or Solid.js (Solid support is weak) app will live update all by
itself! It’s a truly heavenly coding experience.
However, web users do not live in a vacuum, and storing things in IndexedDB is
fraught. The browser may delete that data on a whim, and who among us only has
one device these days? You might be able to use IndexedDB as a cache, but it
can’t be your source of truth.
Until today.</description>

      <title>Processing 6 Billion Chess Games in Less Than 2 Hours</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/ingesting-chess-games/</link>
      <description>Background I run a chess site, https://chessbook.com. We ingest a ton of games, nearly 6 billion, to power our various statistics. Our current database has about 900 million lines. We&amp;amp;rsquo;re working on our next evolution of this database, and that entails re-ingesting all these games, but going much deeper on each game.
Our existing solution was already pretty optimized, you can&amp;amp;rsquo;t get through 1.6 terabytes of data in a reasonable timeframe without some optimization, but we needed to really squeeze more performance out of it this time, as we bumped up the amount of data that it was going to get from each of these 6 billion games.</description>
