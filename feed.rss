      <title>Orchestration vs Choreography</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/orchestration-vs-choreography</link>
      <description>More than 63%+ of organizations said in a Dzone survey that they are adopting Microservices for some or all of their applications.
As more businesses adopt the use of Microservice architectures, we as developers have to become more skilled with Microservices communication.
Working with distributed systems is both fun and challenging at the same time. One of those challenges is designing effective communication between services.
More centralization or less centralization? More coupling or less coupling? More control or less control?
These are only a few questions you need to answer.
In this week&amp;#39;s newsletter, we will:
- Break down Orchestration vs. Choreography - Understand key differences and tradeoffs between them - Create a framework for deciding which approach to use
Let&amp;#39;s dive in!</description>

      <title>An Introduction to OpenAI fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://blog.val.town/blog/an-introduction-to-openai-fine-tuning</link>
      <description>We’ve been tinkering with LLMs to write code on Val Town. Our platform runs vals - little snippets of TypeScript - with zero configuration, no deploying needed. These self-contained bits of functionality seem like the perfect target for something like GPT, with a little training. But we will need to teach GPT a little bit about the platform, which functions are available, how to structure its code. </description>

      <title>Unpacking Elixir: Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-concurrency.html</link>
      <description>Elixir is the thing I do most of my public writing and speaking about. It is my default programming language for the last 5-6 years. It suits my brain. Performs well for the kind of work I typically do. And using it I have experienced very few drawbacks. Rather than writing yet another post trying to widely summarize what I think is beneficial about the language I want to try and go a bit deeper on one particular aspect I like. Not incredibly technically deep, but unpack the concepts more thoroughly. I hope this will be a series of stand-alone posts. We will see. This time we unpack Elixir concurrency (and parallelism).</description>

      <title>Detecting boomerang values in zero-knowledge circuits using tag analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.zksecurity.xyz/blog/posts/boomerang/</link>
      <description>zkApps (zero-knowledge applications) are meant to be provable translations of computer programs. That is, they should behave like the computer programs they are intending to represent, while also providing proofs of correct execution that can accompany program outputs. But as we’ve talked about before, translating programs into provable programs is not a straight forward process. To prove executions, zkApps attempt to “witness” all the important parts of an execution trace. They seek to assert every nook and corner specified (explicitely or implicitely) in the original application.</description>
