      <title>Making Make a README</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/making-make-a-readme</link>
      <description>My side project with the highest gratification-to-effort ratio is a simple
website called Make a README (the source is on
GitHub). I made it in 2017 on a whim. I
was trying to use a third party library that had an anemic README, and it
reminded me of all the other frustrating times I’ve run into inadequate
documentation and wished that Stripe could
write all the software documentation
in the world.</description>

      <description>As humans, we have 24 hours a day to spend as we choose: socializing, sleeping, eating, and - sometimes - learning. What convinces people to dedicate hours, days, or even years to the pursuit of learning? Here are some of the most common reasons - learners may exhibit multiple at a time or move between them, but if you are designing experiences to encourage learning you should be intentional about which ones you emphasize.</description>

Firefox sync, for example, is notoriously hard to get running nicely. In fact, most desktop applications
lack third-party syncing functionality all together.</description>

      <description>Many candidates struggle to express their full potential during a technical interview. As the interviewer, your job is to let them shine. You will certainly look out for red flags, and your attention will naturally be drawn to their technical weak spots. But you’ll have to be intentional if you don’t want to overlook talent.
Your job in a technical interview: prove that this very candidate is the best fit for the role.</description>
