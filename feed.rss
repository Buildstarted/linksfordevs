      <title>Counting Bytes Faster Than You’d Think Possible</title>
      <link>https://blog.mattstuchlik.com/2024/07/21/fastest-memory-read.html</link>
      <description>Summing ASCII Encoded Integers on Haswell at the Speed of memcpy turned out more popular than I expected, which inspired me to take on another challenge on HighLoad: Counting uint8s. I’m currently only #13 on the leaderboard, ~7% behind #1, but I already learned some interesting things. In this post I’ll describe my complete solution (skip to that) including a surprising memory read pattern that achieves up to ~30% higher transfer rates on fully memory bound, single core workloads compared to naive sequential access, while apparently not being widely known (skip to that).</description>

      <description>It’s 2 AM, and I’m staring at my screen, bleary-eyed and frustrated. The CI pipeline has failed for the third time tonight. I’ve spent the last week writing tests for a feature so small, I’m not even sure anyone will notice it. As I sip my cold coffee, a thought creeps in: “Is this really what being a software engineer is all about?”</description>
