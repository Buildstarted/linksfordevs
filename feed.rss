      <title>Linux Mint drops Ubuntu Snap packages</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/825005/6440c82feb745bbe/</link>
      <description>The Linux Mint project has made good on previous threats to actively prevent Ubuntu Snap packages from being installed through the APT package-management system without the user's consent. This move is the result of "major worries" from Linux Mint on Snap's impact with regard to user choice and software freedom. Ubuntu's parent company, Canonical, seems open to finding a solution to satisfy the popular distribution's concerns — but it too has interests to consider.</description>

      <link>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-azure-serverless-with-blazor-web-assembly/</link>
      <description>Introduction
In this article, we will learn how to implement Azure serverless with Blazor web
assembly. And to do that, we will create an app that lists out some Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQ) on Covid-19. 

Here's what we will cover:

 * We will create an Azure Cosmos DB which will act as our primary database to
   store questions and answers. 
 * We will use an Azure function app to fetch data from cosmos DB. 
 * We will deploy the function app to Azure to expose it globally via an API

      <title>When data is messy</title>
      <link>https://aiweirdness.com/post/622648824384602112/when-data-is-messy</link>
      <description>There’s a story I tell in my book because it’s a great illustration of how AI gets the wrong idea about what problem we’re asking it to solve: 

Researchers at the University of Tuebingen trained a neural net to recognize images, and then had it point out which parts of the images were the most important for its decision. When they asked it to highlight the most important pixels for the category “tench” (a kind of fish), this is what it highlighted: 
  
Human fingers against a green background!

Why was it looking for human fingers when it was supposed to be looking for a fish? It turns out that most of the tench pictures the neural net had seen were of people holding the fish as a trophy. It doesn’t have any context for what a tench actually is, so it assumes the fingers are part of the fish.

The image-generating neural net in ArtBreeder (called BigGAN) was also trained on the same dataset, called ImageNet, and when you ask it to generate tenches, this is what it does:
  
The humans are much more distinct than the fish, and I’m fascinated by the highly exaggerated human fingers.

There are other categories in ImageNet that have similar problems. Here’s “microphone”.
  
It’s figured out about dramatic stage lighting and human forms, but many of its images don’t contain anything that remotely resembles a microphone. In so many of its training pictures the microphone is a tiny part of the image, easy to overlook. There are similar problems with small instruments like “flute” and “oboe”.

In other cases, there might be evidence of pictures being mislabeled. In these generated images of “football helmet”, some of them are clearly of people NOT wearing helmets, and a few even look suspiciously like baseball helmets.
  
ImageNet is a really messy dataset. It has a category for agama, but none for giraffe. Rather than horse as a category, it has sorrel (a specific color of horse). “Bicycle built for two” is a category, but not skateboard.
  
A huge reason for ImageNet’s messiness is that it was automatically scraped from images on the internet.  The images were supposed to have been filtered by the crowdsourced workers who labeled them, but plenty of weirdness slipped through. And horribleness - many images and labels that definitely shouldn’t have appeared in a general-purpose research dataset, and images that looked like they had gotten there without the consent of the people pictured. After several years of widespread use by the AI community, the ImageNet team has reportedly been removing some of that content. Other problematic datasets - like those scraped from online images without permission, or from surveillance footage - have been removed recently. (Others, like Clearview AI’s, are still in use.)

This week Vinay Prabhu and Abeba Birhane pointed out major problems with another dataset, 80 Million Tiny Images, which scraped images and automatically assigned tags to them with the help of another neural net trained on internet text. The internet text, you may be shocked to hear, had some pretty offensive stuff in it.  MIT CSAIL removed that dataset permanently rather than manually filter all 80 million images.

This is not just a problem with bad data, but with a system where major research groups can release datasets with such huge issues with offensive language and lack of consent. As tech ethicist Shannon Vallor put it, ”For any institution that does machine learning today, ‘we didn’t know’ isn’t an excuse, it’s a confession”. Like the algorithm that upscaled Obama into a white man, ImageNet is the product of a machine learning community where there’s a huge lack of diversity. (Did you notice that most of the generated humans in this blog post are white? If you didn’t notice, that might be because so much of Western culture treats white as default). 

It takes a lot of work to create a better dataset - and to be more aware of which datasets should never be created. But it’s work worth doing.

Bonus material this week: a few of my favorite BigGAN image categories. Enter your email here for a gallery!

▶SEND ME THEORY QUESTIONS◀
ryan.e.dougherty@icloud.com

▶ABOUT ME◀
I am a professor of Computer Science, and am passionate about CS theory. I have taught over 12 courses at Arizona State University, as well as Colgate University, including several sections of undergraduate theory.

▶ABOUT THIS CHANNEL◀
The theory of computation is perhaps the fundamental theory of computer science. It sets out to define, mathematically, what exactly computation is, what is feasible to solve using a computer, and also what is not possible to solve using a computer. The main objective is to define a computer mathematically, without the reliance on real-world computers, hardware or software, or the plethora of programming languages we have in use today. The notion of a Turing machine serves this purpose and defines what we believe is the crux of all computable functions.

This channel is also about weaker forms of computation, concentrating on two classes: regular languages and context-free languages. These two models help understand what we can do with restricted means of computation, and offer a rich theory using which you can hone your mathematical skills in reasoning with simple machines and the languages they define. 

However, they are not simply there as a weak form of computation--the most attractive aspect of them is that problems formulated on them are tractable, i.e. we can build efficient algorithms to reason with objects such as finite automata, context-free grammars and pushdown automata. For example, we can model a piece of hardware (a circuit) as a finite-state system and solve whether the circuit satisfies a property (like whether it performs addition of 16-bit registers correctly). We can model the syntax of a programming language using a grammar, and build algorithms that check if a string parses according to this grammar.

On the other hand, most problems that ask properties about Turing machines are undecidable. This Youtube channel will help you see and prove that several tasks involving Turing machines are unsolvable---i.e., no computer, no software, can solve it. For example, you will see that there is no software that can check whether a  C program will halt on a particular input. To prove something is possible is, of course, challenging. But to show something is impossible is rare in computer science, and very humbling.</description>

      <title>Ultra Cheap VPS hosts for Tor Bridges</title>
      <link>https://worldofmatthew.com/post/webhosting-for-tor-bridge/</link>
      <description>EAs of the 5th July 2020, there are 1357 Tor bridges available for users in countries who censor the Tor network to use. Having just over 1,000 IP addresses is not a lot for such a big privacy network as Tor is, especially considering that the number of Tor Bridges peaked at 4,227 on the 4th January 2015. That means since then the network has lost more than two-thirds of its bridges.</description>

      <description>We, human beings, are quite good at processing new information, but are terrible in storing them in long-term memory(LTM). LTM is finite and very limited. Many centuries ago, the printing press took a giant step in alleviating this problem. And then, distribution boomed. The number of printed content exploded.
Humans are a sucker for information. How do you find if the information you are searching for exist in that book?</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core Series: Route To Code</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-33Uz32hG0</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud ready, connected applications

In this episode, Ryan Nowak shows us a feature in ASP.NET Core called route to code that allows us to quickly create HTTP endpoints with some of the additional work that comes along with controllers.

[00:57] - Where would you use route to rode?
[02:49] - Getting started Demo
[05:47] - Using the service provider 
[08:58] - Additional JSON methods for HTTP client 
[12:18] - Choosing to use route to code
