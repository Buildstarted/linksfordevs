      <link>https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/how-to-shuffle-songs/</link>
      <description>At Spotify we take user feedback seriously. We noticed some users complaining about our shuffling algorithm playing a few songs from the same artist right after each other. The users were asking “Why isn’t your shuffling random?”. We responded “Hey! Our shuffling is random!” So who was right? As it turns out, both we and [...]</description>

      <description>Using web dev skills to test web dev skills / Last year or so, I worked on a platform where I would publish video courses. The first one is on web fundamentals (in Bulgarian), and it&amp;#39;s almost ready. You can check it out here. But this article is not about that. It&amp;#39;s about a platform feature I built - an in-house validator to exercise the gained HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. After each lesson, I give a task to the students, and they can work on it right in the browser. The small application became an inspiration for another project - iloveweb.dev. So, I decided to share how the validation works.

      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2022/substack-centralization/</link>
      <description>Time and again we get the feeling that human history is doomed to the same old script over and over again, only with slightly different characters and contexts.
A few years ago Substack emerged as a prime destination for weekend writers and people who want to take the radical act of writing longform text on the web seriously. Not by chance: it is an easy-to-use, fancy, and ever evolving tool. Most importantly, it is totally free unless you charge for your newsletter, and there is no pressure to charge for it at all.</description>
