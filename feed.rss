      <description>Here are all the import Python language features you need to know. -- Basics These are all the built-in data structure types in Python: `` primitives x = 1 integer x = 1.2 float x = True bool x = None null x = float(&amp;#39;inf&amp;#39;) infinity (float) objects x = [1, 2, 3] list x = (1, 2, 3) tuple x = 1: &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; dict x = 1, 2, 3 set x = &amp;quot;abc123&amp;quot; str `` You can convert between types like this: `` n = 7 str(n) &amp;#39;7&amp;#39; int(&amp;#39;7&amp;#39;) 7 x = [1,2,3] set(x) 1,2,3 tuple(x) (1,2,3) s = 1,2,3 list(s) [3,1,2], sets don&amp;#39;t store ord</description>

      <title>Beyond Foreign Keys</title>
      <link>https://lackofimagination.org/2024/04/beyond-foreign-keys/</link>
      <description>In a relational database, foreign keys are normally used to associate records stored in different tables, but wouldn’t it be nice to define relationships dynamically without having to add extra columns or tables? And while we’re at it, how about having sparse relationships by associating a record directly with any other record like “post X was last edited by user #123” or “post X was flagged for review by user #456” (who happens to be a moderator)?</description>

      <link>https://tegowerk.eu/posts/minimalism/</link>
      <description>You’ve heard this one, I’m sure: Buy experiences, not things. Have you noticed how it’s always delivered with more than a hint of smug condescension? How it always seems to be a value judgment on the way you live your life?
It seems to me that the advice is almost always coming from two types of people: the extroverted, or the terminally online. The extrovert wants you to travel. Travel is the magic panacea to all of life’s problems.</description>

      <title>More Agents Is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120</link>
      <description>We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence. Our code is publicly available at: \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/more_agent_is_all_you_need}.</description>

      <title>You can’t spell “Gell-Mann amnesia” without LLM</title>
      <link>https://esham.io/2024/03/gell-mann-amnesia</link>
      <description>For a while I assumed we were all on the same page about this AI thing. I thought we all understood that—aside from the considerable ethical concerns with the unauthorized scraping of everybody’s creative work, and the dismal treatment of the people who annotate that work, and the electricity it takes to compile those annotations into models, and the likelihood that companies will see this new technology as a cheaper alternative to their human employees—those things aside, I thought we agreed that all of these “AI” systems are fundamentally just making shit up, and that if they happen to construct coherent sentences more often than your phone’s predictive-text keyboard then the difference is one of degree rather than kind. It’s amazing that the technology works as well as it does, but it’s been clear for a while now that these tools are unreliable, and that that unreliability is inherent.</description>

      <title>pkgsrc on macOS: still works</title>
      <link>https://schmonz.com/2024/04/02/pkgsrc-on-macos-still-works/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago, Apple released new versions of
Xcode
and
Command Line Tools.
Not thinking too hard about how
my pkgsrc developer environment
often gets broken by OS or tool updates, I updated promptly.
For one thing, I’m
kinda used to it.
For another, it doesn’t usually break.
For a third thing, managing dependencies — anything not my code that can break my code — means responsibility for dealing with the inevitable trouble, and therefore the sooner I find it the better.
(More on my approach to life with dependencies.)</description>

      <description>The license that Microsoft imposes on the Windows runtime SDK makes it
impossible for the gcc/mingw-w64 developers to use the official CRT
.lib files. They have to recreate everything from scratch, and in
particular, they need to jerry-rig their own mechanism for linking to
ucrtbase.dll.</description>

      <description>A button is a deceptively hard web component to get right. A good button makes a lot of things simple to do. You only need to press one thing, and a lot of things happen.
&amp;gt; “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” ~ Steve Jobs
Beyond what the button does, it also captures intent. The user desires to interact with this button because they want what it offers.</description>
