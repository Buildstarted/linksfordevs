      <description>The Pursuit Last couple of months have been interesting on a multitude of levels. Global pandemic and economic doom notwithstanding, the pandemic has been a net positive for me on a professional and financial level.
Working from home for the past 5 months has given me a lot of time to reflect and do some planning around the things I want to learn and, by extension achieve in the near future.</description>

      <title>Why I Self-Host My Website Analytics</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/why-i-self-host-my-analytics/</link>
      <description>Recently I made the switch to self-hosted analytics, after being a long-term Google Analytics user. Almost every website you visit will have a Google Analytics tracker on it. I think there are idealogical and technical reasons to opt for self-hosted analytics instead.
Tracking efficacy This one’s quick. You’re more likely to get analytics for a given user if you’re using self-hosted analytics, than if you’re using Google Analytics. About 26% of people are running adblockers now, a large percentage of which will also block tracking scripts, like GA.</description>
