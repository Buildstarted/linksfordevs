      <title>Etcd, or, why modern software makes me sad</title>
      <link>https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/07/etcd-or-why-modern-software-makes-me-sad/</link>
      <description>Once upon a time in 2013, there was a tool called etcd which was a really lightweight database written around the Raft consensus algorithm. This tool was originally written in 2013 for a bullshit unsuccessful project called CoreOS Container Linux that was EOL'd several years ago, but that doesn't really matter — etcd was greater than its original use-case. Etcd provided a convenient and simple set of primitives (set a key, get a key, set-only-if-unchanged, watch-for-changes) with a drop-dead simple HTTP API on top of them. I have built a number of tools using etcd as a lightweight consensus store behind …</description>

      <title>How to Run a Live Coding Stream on Twitch using OBS</title>
      <link>https://jordanlewis.org/posts/twitch-live-coding/</link>
      <description>If you’re reading this post, you might be interested in trying your hand at live coding on stream, as a way of sharing your projects in a more relatable, immediate way than a polished blog post, teaching others about programming, or just as a way to have fun. I think that live coding and streams in general are an interesting possible future form of both education and entertainment, and if you’re contemplating starting your own stream, I sincerely hope that you do it.</description>

      <title>Ex-Googler's Startup Comes Out of Stealth With Beautifully Simple, Clever Robot Design - IEEE Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/hello-robots-stretch-mobile-manipulator</link>
      <description>Over the last 10 years, the PR2 has helped roboticists make an enormous amount of progress in mobile manipulation over a relatively short time. I mean, it’s been a decade already, but still—robots are hard, and giving a bunch of smart people access to a capable platform where they didn’t have to worry about hardware and could instead focus on doing interesting and useful things helped to establish a precedent for robotics research going forward.</description>

      <description>When building ASP.NET Core backends for SPA applications one thing that you have to worry about is how to handle client side routes that end up being fired against the server through external or reloaded links. While ASp.NET Core has built-in support for this if you build a generic Web server, you might need a little more control on how to handle the Fallback routing functionality. Here's how.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Assemblies Load in C# .NET - Michael's Coding Spot</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/assemblies-load-in-dotnet/</link>
      <description>We are constantly dealing with libraries and NuGet packages. These libraries depend on other popular libraries and there are a lot of shared dependencies. With a large enough web of dependencies, you'll eventually get into conflicts or hard situations. The best way to deal with such issues is to understand how the mechanism works internally.</description>

      <description>The AirPods Pro “Rattlegate”
The first generation of the AirPods was generally regarded as a perfect product. “Apple at its best!” was the universally accepted opinion.
I used them for a long time. No speaker issues, no battery issues.
Excited for the noise cancelling feature I ordered the AirPods Pro and for the first few months everything was fine. One day the left AirPod started buzzing every time I was moving my head.</description>

      <title>A $50.000/year streaming service | Gianluca Mauro</title>
      <link>https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/post/harvard-online-learning/</link>
      <description>Harvard University announced that next academic year will be 100% online.
And the tuition won’t be a dime cheaper.
Why does it matter?
I don’t want to question the worthiness of such an investment. Yet, I can’t help but wonder if you’ll loose some of your returns by switching from the Harvard University halls to your web browser.
When you give $50.000 to a University like Harvard, you’re paying for a bunch of stuff.</description>
