      <title>Improve your shell skills with Clai</title>
      <link>https://vanderwijk.info/posts/improve-shell-skills-clai/</link>
      <description>I created a very simple command line utility in go that helps you create non-trivial command line / shell commands. It’s actually just a thin wrapper around the openai API’s, but it can be pretty usefull and saves you from switching to a chatgpt session or stackoverflow.
E.g.
 $ clai &amp;quot;group a tab separated file by first column, sum them by third column&amp;quot; awk -F&amp;#39;	&amp;#39; &amp;#39;{sum[$1] += $3} END {for(group in sum) print group, sum[group]}&amp;#39; file.</description>

      <link>https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud/post/introduction-to-chaos-engineering-serverless</link>
      <description>Chaos engineering is a proactive methodology that intentionally introduces controlled disruptions and failures into a system to uncover weaknesses, enhance resilience, and ensure robust performance in the face of unforeseen outages. Everything fails, all the time — DR. Werner Vogels, CTO Amazon This is the mantra we developers need to repeat every time we plan a distributed system, and this is precisely why chaos engineering is so important.

      <title>Machine Learning to Ski</title>
      <link>https://obrhubr.github.io/skiing-ai</link>
      <description>All ski tracking apps can record information about your day on the slopes, including top speed and distance traveled. More importantly, they offer advanced analysis, such as differentiating between time spent on the lift and actual skiing. However, they rely on GPS data instead of utilising the phone&amp;#39;s internal sensors, which provide more precise data. Could a machine learning model provide more accurate analysis by relying on sensor data?</description>

      <title>A minimal, complete and correct ELF file</title>
      <link>https://scratchpad.avikdas.com/elf-explanation/elf-explanation.html</link>
      <description>As part of the compiler for my homebrew language, Garlic, I&amp;#39;ve been exploring what&amp;#39;s in an ELF file. This is so I can output a binary file, ready for execution, instead of depending on an external compiler like GCC to do that last step. As a first step, I&amp;#39;ve hand-generated, byte-by-byte, a small ELF file that can be run on a 64-bit x86-64 Linux installation.</description>

      <title>Goodbye Non-KISS Appliances</title>
      <link>https://willbush.dev/blog/complex-appliances/</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Yesterday, we gave away our ~6-year-old GE French-door refrigerator after a
never-ending slog of repairs. At least the guy and his mother who came to pick
it up have a side-hustle of repairing and reselling appliances. There&amp;#39;s hope it
won&amp;#39;t end up in a landfill. He offered to sell me a 4-door Samsung. No Thanks!
I&amp;#39;m done with over-complicated appliances. Refrigerator repair is not a skill
I&amp;#39;m looking to hone any further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
