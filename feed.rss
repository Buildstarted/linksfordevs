      <title>Why We Chose Prodigy • Marty Hu</title>
      <link>http://martyhu.com/why-we-chose-prodigy</link>
      <description>People often ask me why Michia and I chose the name “Prodigy” for our company. The truth is, we picked the name over a 30 minute conversation while Michia was walking over to my house. We knew that we wanted to start a B2B company and that we... | Marty Hu | Christian | Co-Founder at Prodigy | Hacker</description>

      <title>You don't need this fancy recommendations system</title>
      <link>https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/you-dont-need-this-fancy-recommendations-system/</link>
      <description>I spent years on looking for a powerful and accurate recommendations system that would give me the titles of the movies I was desperately needing to bring my film knowledge to completeness (we movie buffs are quite obsessional - and we try to heal ourselves with making lists). The more I discovered new movies and new directors, the more the recommendations engine I was using were proved ineffective.
It looks like we try to address the need for recommendations always with the same tools and the same approach, regardless of the matter.</description>

      <description>I get this question a lot! The answer is usually… don’t. If you already know what you want to do, then the question doesn’t need to be asked.1 But, if you don’t already know what you want to do, then your time might be better spent elsewhere! Or perhaps the better question is “where should I start with this goal?” ↩</description>

      <description>At work, I’ve recently been asked to advise our engineers on how to write blog posts. A lot of such articles are already available. However, they tend to focus around two main themes: The technical publishing platform e.g. Jekyll, Medium, etc.Metrics e.g. readability score, SEO, etc. Beyond that, everyone is on one’s own. But I believe that writing a good technical article is as much art as engineering. In this post, I’d like to try to address this gap: I’ve been writi</description>

For most of us, that’s more than enough to deliver a capable production application. For those of us targeting multiple platforms, we may need a configuration for each destination platform.</description>

      <title>Announcing TypeScript 4.0 RC | TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-0-rc/</link>
      <description>Today we’re announcing our release candidate of TypeScript 4.0. While this RC brings us closer to a new major version of TypeScript, don’t fret – there are no larger breaking changes than usual. Our philosophy in evolving TypeScript has always been to provide an upgrade path that minimizes disruptive breaking changes while still giving ourselves some flexibility to flag suspicious code as errors when appropriate.</description>

      <link>https://pablo.pm/on-being-extrovert/</link>
      <description>Yep, I'm an extrovert and people already working with me would agree. Yet I am also quite shy, when talking to people I don’t know, even when we work for the same company! Most of the time I urge a colleague to introduce us. I struggle to introduce myself but I’ll do it when needed.</description>
