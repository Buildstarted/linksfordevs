      <description>Weather forecasts are primarily determined using models run by government agencies, but the outputs aren&amp;#39;t easy to use or in formats built for applications.
To try to address this, I&amp;#39;ve put together a service (built on AWS Lambda) that reads public weather forecasts and serves it following the Dark Sky API style. It is not a reverse engineering of the API, since their implementation relies on radar forecasts for minutely results, as well as a few additional features. The API aims to return data using the same json structure as what Dark Sky uses, available here: https://web.archive.org/web/20200723173936/https://darksky.net/dev/docs. Feel free to register, subscribe to this API (navigate to APIs and click subscribe!), and let me know how it works at api@alexanderrey.ca.
To help support this project (my student AWS credits run out in June!), I&amp;#39;ve set up a donation link. There&amp;#39;s also an option for a $2 monthly donation, which both supports this project and also raises monthly API limit to 50,000! If you need more than 5,000 calls per month, but less than that, then send a message to api@alexanderrey.ca and we can work something out.</description>

      <description>Explorer’s drag/drop effects include a little message information box as part of the drop effect. For example, it will start with the message Move to ⸢folder⸥, but if you hold the Ctrl key, the message changes to Copy to ⸢folder⸥. How can you get a piece of that action?</description>

The idea is rather simple: if a real human is sitting at their keyboard or uses their phone, they can touch their security key’s button or bring it near their phone to demonstrate that they are human.</description>

      <description>Houdini is a set of low-level APIs that exposes parts of the CSS engine, giving developers the power to extend CSS by hooking into the styling and layout process of a browser’s rendering engine.&amp;#160; Houdini is a group of APIs that give developers direct access to the CSS Object Model (CSSOM), enabling developers to write code the browser can parse as CSS, thereby creating new CSS features without waiting for them to be implemented natively in browsers.</description>

      <title>Turns out Elastic aren&amp;#39;t the bad guys</title>
      <link>https://ognjen.io/turns-out-elastic-arent-the-bad-guys/</link>
      <description>Elastic changed the licence for ElasticSearch disallowing providing it as a service. A lot of people were upset. My reflex was to join in the outrage but I wanted to better understand the motivation behind this decision. My reflex was to join in the outrage but I wanted to better understand the motivation behind this decision. I also wanted to consider the different arguments against it. I bookmarked the HackerNews threads and came back to them only recently. I tried to strip away the emotion and noise. Following is a summary of the different arguments that helped me form a more nuanced understanding of the situation.</description>

      <title>The DevRel Lie</title>
      <link>https://ldoguin.name/en/2021/05/the-devrel-lie/</link>
      <description>As Devrel grows more popular so grows its identity crisis and questioning. And COVID-19 didn’t help. We wonder about its meaning. What is it? The good old Marketing or Engineering dilema. How do you measure what you do? This post is not a post about measuring DevRel. And it’s not about other ‘traditional’ topics like planes &amp;amp; airport, burnout and more recently how to become a live streamer. It’s not about Karaoke either sadly.</description>
