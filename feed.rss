      <title>I was building a new website for Post Apathy - until the petulant CEO of Ghost.org deleted my website</title>
      <link>https://postapathy.substack.com/p/i-was-building-a-new-website-for</link>
      <description>In July, I promised to begin a trial for fortnightly newsletters, as opposed to the monthly schedule from previously. Today was meant to be the day where the next newsletter was meant to be sent out, but I decided to delay it as I had been busy building a website via Ghost.org and I wanted to start posting there as soon as it was built, so there was minimum interruption in your access to Post Apathy content.</description>

      <title>Write your Own Virtual Machine</title>
      <link>https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/</link>
      <description>In this tutorial, I will teach you how to write your own virtual machine (VM) that can run assembly language programs, such as my friend's 2048 or my Roguelike. If you know how to program, but would like to gain a deeper understanding of what is going on inside a computer and better understand how programming languages work, then this project is for you. Writing your own VM may sound a little scary, but I promise that you will find it to be surprisingly simple and enlightening.</description>

      <link>https://phys.org/news/2020-08-hubble-betelgeuse-mysterious-dimming-due.html</link>
      <description>Recent observations of Betelgeuse have revealed that the star's unexpected and significant dimming periods in late 2019 and early 2020 were most likely caused by the ejection and cooling of dense hot gases, and that the star may be going through another dimming period more than a year early.</description>
