      <description>In a previous post, I wrote about solving the form resubmission confirm issue that many developers run into when building web applications. In ASP.NET MVC, we have many tools at our disposal to pass information from one method to another, the most common being the TempDataProvider. In this short but enlightening post, we’ll take a look at how we can use a new feature in ASP.NET Core to clean up our usages of TempData.</description>

      <title>MIT 18.S097: Programming with Categories</title>
      <link>http://brendanfong.com/programmingcats.html</link>
      <description>In this course we explain how category theory—a branch of mathematics known for its ability to organize the key abstractions that structure much of the mathematical universe—has become useful for writing elegant and maintainable code. In particular, we'll use examples from the Haskell programming language to motivate category-theoretic constructs, and then explain these constructs from a more abstract and inclusive viewpoint. Hands-on programming exercises will be used to demonstrate categorical ideas like 'the universal property of products' in working Haskell code.</description>

      <description>So The Register managed to incite a lot of discussion with a headline that plain-text e-mail is a barrier to entry for kernel development. While attention grabbing, this is actually not a new debate. Like a lot of tech arguments this one seems to come up on a cyclical basis. Maybe because maintainer summit didn’t happen this year it needed to come out elsewhere. I gave a few thoughts on twitter but this topic really deserves a longer look at the problem and what e-mail being a barrier really means.</description>
