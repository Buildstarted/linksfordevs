Hello, everybody. I'm Nick, and in this video, I will talk about the new C# 14 feature called Null Conditional assignment, which simplifies code even further and allows you to remove a lot of unnecessary long null checks.

      <description>For years I‚Äôve wanted to build a super-dense electronic-music compressor: keep only the loops and phase cues that really matter, then re-synthesise the track perfectly. Evenings and weekends, however, were never long enough to design the model, write the maths, and wrangle PyTorch. Recently I opened ChatGPT running the ‚Ä¶</description>

      <title>The Programmer's Climb</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/programmers-climb/</link>
      <description>As a computer science undergrad in the mid-90s, my ‚ÄúIntroduction to Programming‚Äù course in the very first semester was modeled after the legendary ‚ÄúStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs‚Äù by Abelson and Sussman.
For a quarter-century at MIT, Abelson, Sussman, and colleagues used Scheme to teach freshmen how to manufacture abstractions almost artisanally from scratch. Rooted in the Lisp ethos, the premise was that by understanding a handful of primitives and mastering a small set of combinators, students could build a platonic ladder of abstractions‚Äîa veritable cathedral of computation‚Äîand still reason about every brick. This pedagogical approach involved first creating abstractions to model the problem domain, effectively designing a custom language in which the final solution could then be expressed cleanly, almost self-evidently.</description>

      <title>Create Missing RSS Feeds With LLMs</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/posts/create-missing-rss-feeds-with-llms/</link>
      <description>It used to be that blogs all had RSS feeds. Somehow there are more blogs than ever before, but some people do not bother with setting up an RSS feed.
The following blogs have nice content, but are annoying to follow without RSS.
https://aider.chat/blog/ https://jkatz05.com/ https://getreuer.info/ Every time I stumble on one of these, it takes me a while to remember a fun workaround. I decided to write this down as a blog post so I have an easier time looking up the details.</description>

      <description>Suppose you are participating in an auction for a box. Nobody knows exactly what is in the box, but they are bidding on it for various reasons; some think they can make money, some might have sentimental reasons, and others might just be having fun. You yourself are trying to make money. You asked around a bit, did some research, and think that you have a good estimate for the value of the box. You think it‚Äôs worth $10,000 and decide to bid $9,000.</description>

      <title>Run AI Offline in C#.NET</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=lc6lVCe0XHI</link>
      <description>In this video, I‚Äôll walk you through how to run powerful AI models completely offline using llama-cli ‚Äî and how to interface it with a C# application! üöÄ

We'll cover:

0/ Installing and setting up llama-cli
1/ Downloading and using GGUF models
2/ Running text generation locally without an internet connection
3/ Building a simple C# integration to send prompts and receive AI responses
4/ Why learning to run AI offline is critical ‚Äî for privacy, cost control, performance, and future-proofing your projects
5/ Best practices for using offline AI in your own apps

Whether you're building secure apps, working with sensitive data, or just want full control over your AI models, this guide will help you get started!

üîó Useful links and code samples are in the description below:
Download Llama CLI and Dlls from here:
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases

Download TinyLlama Model (GGUF file):
https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/tree/main
