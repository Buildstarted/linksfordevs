      <title>Fasting mimicking diet as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in the multicentre randomized phase 2 DIRECT trial</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16138-3</link>
      <description>Preclinical evidence suggests that a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) can make cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy, while protecting normal cells. In this randomized phase II clinical trial of 131 patients with HER2 negative early stage breast cancer, the authors demonstrate that FMD is safe and enhances the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on radiological and pathological tumor response.</description>

      <title>Embarrassing product names averted: Windows Embedded POS and Windows 10 for Advanced PCs | The Old New Thing</title>

      <description>Windows Embedded for point of sale systems is not called Windows Embedded POS, even though POS is the the industry standard acronym for the term point of sale. Because in the English language, POS is also a slang acronym for something much less complimentary.</description>

      <title>Moment.js | Docs</title>
      <link>https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/</link>
      <description>Moment.js has been successfully used in millions of projects, and we are happy to have contributed to making date and time better on the web.
As of September 2020, Moment gets over 12 million downloads per week!  However, Moment was built for the previous era of the JavaScript ecosystem.
The modern web looks much different these days.  Moment has evolved somewhat over the years, but it has essentially the same design as it did when it was created in 2011.
Given how many projects depend on it, we choose to prioritize stability over new features.</description>

      <title>Don't get burned by missing await Calls for Async Code in ASP.NET Core Middleware</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Sep/14/Dont-get-burned-by-missing-await-Calls-for-Async-Code-in-ASPNET-Core-Middleware</link>
      <description>I recently got burned in an upgraded ASP.NET Core server application where a missing `await` statement caused wildly inconsistent and puzzling output failures. While a simple thing to avoid, once introduced it's possible to live with this error for some time before it manifests. In this post I show a scenario where a missing `await` was causing infrequent HTTP response errors, even though the client apparently receives a valid response.</description>

      <title>Phosphine gas in the cloud decks of Venus</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4</link>
      <description>The detection of ~20 ppb of phosphine in Venus clouds by observations in the millimetre-wavelength range from JCMT and ALMA is puzzling, because according to our knowledge of Venus, no phosphine should be there. As the most plausible formation paths do not work, the source could be unknown chemical processes—maybe even life?</description>

      <description>I first learned the term “turboing” when I worked second-level telephone
technical support at Xerox. It refers to the actions of a customer who goes
around the normal technical support process by contacting a senior person in
the chain of command.</description>

      <title>The compositor is evil</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/ui/graphics/2020/09/13/compositor-is-evil.html</link>
      <description>First, I want to make it clear that I’m not accusing the compositor of true evil, which I define roughly as deliberately causing suffering. There’s unfortunately too much of that in the world. I mean it in the more metaphorical sense that it causes serious problems and forces other parts of the system to be more complex to work around its limitations.</description>

      <link>https://georgestocker.com/2020/09/14/ubm-and-a-lament-for-the-software-industry/</link>
      <description>I grew up in tech as a UBM fan. Ok, not really a fan, but a “there’s very few voices writing books about ‘how to write code well’, and this person seems to know what they’re doing, so I’m going to listen to him”.  I read all his books; attended talks he gave at SCNA, and thought for a while that his way was the right way.</description>

      <title>GNSS Jamming and Spoofing, aka Galileo's Authentication Algorithm Part 3 - Articles</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/galileos-authentication-algorithm-part-3/</link>
      <description>Welcome to part 3 of my series on OSNMA, the proposed Galileo Navigation Message Authentication protocol. This part can be read independently from part 1 and part 2, but it might be useful to read the introduction to part 1.
This post attempts to explain GPS (GNSS) jamming and spoofing, so it might be a useful read even if you don’t care about Galileo or its authentication.
As usual, I’ve been helped tremendously by Daniel Estévez &amp; many other researchers and Galileo professionals, and again I am very greatful for all the links, corrections, suggestions and knowledge you provided.</description>

      <title>Febraury 13, 2020 - Blazor TreeView GridLines and starting the FormView component</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXup9SeWjSM</link>
      <description>Today Fritz finished the GridLine implementation for the TreeView Blazor component and built a sample to show how the FormView should behave.

Questions:
15:13 - Does a TreeView really need grid lines?
44:38 - Do the TreeNodes register with the parent in Onlnitalized?
45:46 - Can TreeNodes register with the parent TreeNode as they're drawn?
47:41 - This is as close to a "Pattern" with Blazor: Child Components register with their Parent component
51:14 - Should I create my 'Creative Coding' stream? What worked for you and why did you start?
1:39:15 - Am I the only one that gets an SSL error for docs.microsoft.com?
2:07:40 - With Git push, shouldn't it be pushing the current branch if you don't provide a branch name?

      <title>February 14, 2020 - Blazor Coding with Squirrel</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbiJXs6QFZc</link>
      <description>In a fun-filled episode that was just NUTS to make, Fritz dons a squirrel costume provided by viewers as he writes code.  After about 30 minutes of shenanigans and more puns than you can shake a stick at, Fritz gets back into working on the BlazorWebFormsComponents.

He continues working on the FormView component for Blazor, adding support for FooterTemplates.  He is challenged by the viewers to use the Peanut Font while coding (http://www.fontriver.com/font/peanut/) and spends 15 minutes in that configuration.  He adds the Pager feature to the FormView along with appropriate integration tests to show it off.

1:22:11 - Would you recommend a novice developer learn command line Git? Or is a GUI acceptable in 2002?
