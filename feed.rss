      <description>
I‚Äôve just shipped StringZilla v4, the first CUDA-capable release of my SIMD-first string processing library. Which in English means that it is now fast not only on CPUs, but also on GPUs!
I‚Äôve wanted to add ROCm-acceleration for AMD GPUs ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve wanted to include a parallel multi-pattern search algorithm ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôve wanted to publish it back in December 2024, not September 2025 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So not everything went to plan, but ‚ÄúStringZilla 4 CUDA‚Äù is finally here, bringing 500+ GigaCUPS of edit-distance calculations in a free pip install-able package, and a few more tricks up its sleeve, aimed at large-scale Information Retrieval, Databases and Datalake systems, as well as Bioinformatics workloads. So in this post, we‚Äôll cover some of the most interesting parts of this release, including:</description>

      <description>I quit the startup before Figma after just 3 months. It‚Äôs not on my LinkedIn so you can‚Äôt look it up. It wasn‚Äôt the right role for me but I went for it, partly due to the higher pay. They offered way more than I made previously, which turned out to be pretty unfortunate.</description>

      <title>Fight Chat Control (@chatcontrol@mastodon.social)</title>
      <link>https://mastodon.social/@chatcontrol/115215006562371435</link>
      <description>Attached: 1 image

Germany's position has been reverted to UNDECIDED.

Despite expressing concerns about breaking end-to-end encryption, Germany refrained from taking a definitive stance on the Chat Control proposal during the September 12th LEWP meeting. A willingness to negotiate and compromise remains.

This is an unfortunate development as Germany is crucial to defeating Chat Control. 

Please make your voices heard! https://fightchatcontrol.eu/

      <title>Apple Photos App Corrupts Images</title>
      <link>https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/09/17/apple-photos-app-corrupts-images/</link>
      <description>The Apple Photos app sometimes corrupts images when importing from my camera. I just wanted to make a blog post about it in case anyone else runs into the problem. I‚Äôve seen other references to this online, but most of the people gave up trying to fix it, and none of them went as far as I did to debug the issue.
I‚Äôll try to describe the problem, and the things I‚Äôve tried to do to fix it. But also note that I‚Äôve (sort of) given up on the Photos app too. Since I can‚Äôt trust it to import photos from my camera, I switched to a different workflow.</description>
