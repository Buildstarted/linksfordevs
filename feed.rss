      <title>When Zero Cost Abstractions Aren’t Zero Cost</title>
      <link>https://blog.polybdenum.com/2021/08/09/when-zero-cost-abstractions-aren-t-zero-cost.html</link>
      <description>Rust is built around the concept of “zero cost abstraction”. The idea is that you can write human-friendly high level code and the compiler will give you for free performance at least as good as any optimized low level code you could have written yourself. With zero cost abstraction, you no longer have to trade off between maintainability and performance.</description>
