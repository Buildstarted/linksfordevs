The two are separate technologies, although ASP.NET MVC does utilize Razor as its HTML rendering engine.</description>

      <description>When you inject events into the cloud, do you care whether they come out in the same order they went in?  If you do, you’ll be
    asking for “FIFO” (rhymes with “Fly, foe!”) (stands for “First In First Out”). Some software has it, some doesn’t.</description>

      <description>What happened was, at re:Invent 2019 I gave a talk entitled
    Moving to Event-Driven Architecture, discussing a list of
    characteristics that distinguish eventing and messaging services.  It was a lot of work pulling the

      <description>When you fire an event into the cloud, can you be sure it’ll only come out again once?  It turns out that 
    sometimes they come out more often than they go in.  This may or may not be a problem in your
    application. If it is, there are techniques to help work around it.</description>
