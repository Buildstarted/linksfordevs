      <title>Drapetomania - Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania</link>
      <description>Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity.[1]:41 Contemporarily reprinted in the South, Cartwright&amp;#39;s article was widely mocked and satirized in the northern United States. The concept has since been debunked as pseudoscience[2]:2 and shown to be part of the edifice of scientific racism.[3]</description>

      <title>Tearing Down a Humidifier - Lei&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.leiy.me/post/tear-down-humidifier/</link>
      <description>Last Black Friday, I got an Apple HomePod, so I’m in the process of hooking everything onto HomeKit.
(Nesthub, a Nest Thermostat to Apple HomeKit bridge in pure Golang,
was my most recent undertaking in this department.) Winters in New England can be pretty dry,
so we have a $40 humidifier 1 at home that, well, humidifies the room. Naturally, I want a HomeKit-enabled
humidifier. However, Apple’s website lists only one model currently on sale, and that model has a very
small water tank which won’t last even a day. Meanwhile, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W lying around, so it seems
a good idea to put the Raspberry Pi into the humidifier to add HomeKit support. After all, everyone wants
a humidifier with an 1 GHz ARM processor inside, isn’t it?</description>

      <title>I&amp;#39;m tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2021/02/02/Anti-Wayland-horseshit.html</link>
      <description>What do anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, 9/11 truthers, and anti-Wayland activism
all have in common? All of them are characterized by a blithe rejection of facts
to embrace a narrative of victimization by a vague authority. In the case of
Wayland, the “vague authority” are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted tens
of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.
“Wayland sucks!” is a conspiracy theory with no basis in truth, and its
supporters have spent years harassing Wayland maintainers, contributors, and
users. And it’s time for it to fucking stop.</description>
