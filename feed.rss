      <description>Google won&amp;#39;t be mandating a five-day-a-week return-to-office plan. Employees at the tech giant were concerned about losing their hybrid work schedule after Amazon mandated staff to return to the office five days a week. </description>

      <title>Were RNNs All We Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201</link>
      <description>The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.</description>

      <description>I recently saw a video pop up in my YouTube feed, “Why I Prefer Exceptions To Errors” by ThePrimeTime. The title is a little misleading, as it refers to an article that Primeagen is reacting to. In the video, he makes a case for preferring Errors over Exceptions.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering and Dismantling Kekz Headphones</title>
      <link>https://nv1t.github.io/blog/kekz-headphones/</link>
      <description>Close to a year ago, I stumbled upon the Kekz Headphones, which seemed like an interesting approach on the whole digital audio device space. They claimed to work without any internet connection and all of the content already on the headphones itself.
I was intrigued, because there were some speculations going around, how they operate with those “Kekz”-Chips.
I invite you to join me on a journey into the inner workings of those headphones. We will talk about accessing the encrypted files on the device, breaking the crypto and discovering disclosure of data from customers.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed how much some kids love to push buttons or flip a light switch on and off? My son loved it so much I built him a button box using an Arduino, 10 mechanical keyboard switches with RGB lights, and a speaker. Here is a video of him learning his colors, the first activity I built for him.</description>

      <title>the Statistical Abstracts of the United States || cmos</title>
      <link>https://www.christianmoscardi.com/blog/2024/10/03/digitizing-us-statistical-abstracts.html</link>
      <description>Several years ago, a friend working on his PhD asked if I could help digitize the Statistical Abstracts of the United States in order to spare him the hassle of going through these documents page-by-page. These abstracts are a historical Census Bureau dataset that includes many interesting things, like how many chickens were in the United States in 1920 (the Chicken Census is now conducted and published by USDA). If you want to know, there were ~360 million chickens in the United States in 1920.</description>
