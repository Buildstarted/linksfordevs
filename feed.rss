      <title>Human evals are outsourced vibe checks</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/human-evals-are-outsourced-vibe-checks/</link>
      <description>Engineering has always been about measurement and evaluation. But when it comes to LLMs, traditional approaches to evaluation don’t work as cleanly as they do for other software systems.
Of course, evals and benchmarks are an important signal (perhaps the only signal) of raw capability. They show us improvement over time. The fact that many of the original benchmarks from a year or so ago are at or near saturation also tells us a lot.</description>

      <title>It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds - Bert Hubert&amp;#39;s writings</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/</link>
      <description>The very short version: it is madness to continue transferring the running of European societies and governments to American clouds. Not only is it a terrible idea given the kind of things the “King of America” keeps saying, the legal sophistry used to justify such transfers, like the nonsense letter the Dutch cabinet sent last week, has now been invalidated by Trump himself. And why are we doing this? Convenience.</description>

      <description>Terraform isn&amp;#39;t just a fancy tool for spinning up VMs—it’s the backbone of modern cloud automation. Whether you&amp;#39;re managing multi-cloud environments, automating disaster recovery, or deploying Kubernetes clusters, Terraform has got you covered. In this post, we’ll dive into practical use cases where Terraform truly shines, proving that Infrastructure as Code (IaC) isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer.</description>

      <description>I think it is important to have a bias for action. Like anything else, this is something you can make a habit of. Moving forward allows you to make progress. I don’t know about you, but I’ve frozen up in the past not knowing what the right path was for me. Moving forward, even the smallest possible step, helped break that stasis.</description>

      <description>Recently I wanted to speed up a demo video 10 times. Having minimum experience with video editing but convinced that such a simple action should be possible with a built-in Windows editor, I mindlessly searched &amp;quot;windows video speed up&amp;quot; on DuckDuckGo and clicked the first credible-looking result. According to the tutorial, the speed-up could be done in the native Photos app on Windows. Great!</description>

      <title>Introducing AIBrix: Cost-Effective and Scalable Control Plane for vLLM</title>
      <link>https://aibrix.github.io/posts/2025-02-20-vllm-control-plane/</link>
      <description>Open-source large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Deepseek, Qwen and Mistral etc have surged in popularity, offering enterprises greater flexibility, cost savings, and control over their AI deployments. These models have empowered organizations to build their own AI-driven applications, from chatbots and agents to content generation and recommendation systems.
However, while these models are widely accessible, turning them into cost-efficient, production-grade APIs remains a significant challenge. Achieving low-latency, scalable inference requires more than just an optimized model—it demands a holistic system approach that spans multiple layers, from the model itself to the inference engine and the surrounding infrastructure.</description>

      <description>From Google Docs to Plain Text I recently moved from using Google Docs to creating plain text files using TextEdit on my Macbook. I now have a simple content management system with all my files that lives on my desktop, and is backed up remotely using Github.
Some of my files include things like: watch lists, ideas, notes, journal entries, old writings and more. I was inspired to move over to plain text after reading a blog post by Derek Sivers, who gave me these four good reasons for doing so:</description>
