      <title>Why is it so hard to find a job now? Enter Ghost Jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21771</link>
      <description>This study investigates the emerging phenomenon of &amp;quot;ghost hiring&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ghost jobs&amp;quot;, where employers advertise job openings without intending to fill them. Using a novel dataset from Glassdoor and employing a LLM-BERT technique, I find that up to 21% of job ads may be ghost jobs, and this is particularly prevalent in specialized industries and in larger firms. The trend could be due to the low marginal cost of posting additional job ads and to maintain a pipeline of talents. After adjusting for yearly trends, I find that ghost jobs can explain the recent disconnect in the Beveridge Curve in the past fifteen years. The results show that policy-makers should be aware of such a practice as it causes significant job fatigue and distorts market signals.</description>

      <title>Nov 13th, 2024 - Ollama, Qwen2.5-Coder, Continue, and Rider: Your Local Copilot</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=lDWSzQ5V6ik</link>
      <description>On November 13th, 2024, Jamie ran a short (for him anyway) stream showing off how he had leveraged Ollama, some free language models (qwen2.5-coder and llama3.2), and Continue to create a GitHub Copilot-like experience in the entire suite of JetBrains products.

This was originally streamed on Twitch at https://www.twitch.tv/gaprogman

This stream focused on using Rider and a .NET project of his, but the Continue config (which is stored in your user area) is automatically picked up by any JetBrains product AND by Visual Studio Code if the Continue extensions are installed.

Links mentioned in this stream:

- Ollama - run large language models locally: https://ollama.com/
- Llama3.2 - a small language model created by Meta: https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2/
- Qwen2.5-Code - a large language model trained on code: https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder
- Continue - add GitHub Copilot-like functionality to VS Code or any JetBrains product: https://www.continue.dev/
- OwaspHeaders.Core - a NuGet package for adding OWASP recommended HTTP headers to ASP .NET Core applications: https://www.nuget.org/packages/OwaspHeaders.Core/
- Chillhop - the chillest music on the Internet: https://chillhop.com/
- The Modern .NET Show - the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox: https://dotnetcore.show/</description>
