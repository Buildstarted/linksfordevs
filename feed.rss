      <description>I recently ran into a snag with one of the my Windows Server installs of an upgraded .NET Core 5.0 application. It turns out I didn&amp;#39;t install .NET Core 5.0 correctly because I made some bad assumptions of what I needed to install to run my application, even though it previously ran on .NET Core 3.1. Here&amp;#39;s more detail on what the failure looks like and how to properly install .NET Core 5.0. </description>

      <title>Caching - Simply Explained</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0</link>
      <description>What is a cache? How does it work, and why is it important?

Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It&amp;#39;s found in many hardware components and throughout software. The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker.

That&amp;#39;s why browsers keep a cache: so they don&amp;#39;t have to re-download everything from the internet over and over again.

      <title>Preliminary notes on analyzing Disk and File I/O performance with ETW traces | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201125-00/?p=104480</link>
      <description>Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a powerful tool for blah blah blah. (Sometimes I get tired of writing the introduction.) Here’s a little diagram of how I/O happens. This diagram is not 100% accurate, but it’ll do for the purpose of today’s discussion.</description>

      <title>Reliably Save State &amp;amp; Publish Events (Outbox Pattern)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fOnxAxKHk</link>
      <description>What&amp;#39;s the Outbox Pattern? A reliable way of saving state to your database and publishing a message/event to a message broker.

Why do you need it? When you get into messaging, you will often find code that needs to save state to your database, and then publish an message/event to a message broker.  Unfortunately because they are two different resources, you need a distributed transaction to make these atomic.  There is another option to use the Outbox Pattern which does not require a distributed transaction and most messaging libraries support it.

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/24/Upgrading-to-NET-Core-50</link>
      <description>Over the last week I spent some time upgrading several .NET Core Web applications and libraries from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0. I&amp;#39;m happy to say that this was always a non-event as the process went very smooth for once. In this post I&amp;#39;ll talk about what I found and also offer some commentary why we should celebrate this update and push Microsoft to continue along this path.</description>
