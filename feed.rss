      <title>Tip 274 - Set Your AzContext Interactively</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip274.html</link>
      <description>If you are working with Azure, the probability of you having multiple accounts and subscriptions to work with are very high. If I look at myself, I have a personal account, a business account and my workaccount that I often use everyday. Deploying scripts through Powershell requires you to make sure you are in the right context. Especially with the rise of Azure Lighthouse, where you maybe have access to a lot of subscriptions through one account, a simple mistake is easily made.</description>

      <link>https://virtual.devintersection.com/#!/workshop/Advanced%20.NET,%20Containers%20and%20Azure/4591</link>
      <description>This workshop will walk .NET customers through all the options for hosting their code in Azure using Windows, Linux and Containers. You will learn how to develop locally on Windows and Linux and containers and then publish and diagnose your applications in Azure. Next we will take a deep dive into building API‚Äôs and gPRC services in .NET that can be called from all platforms. Including developing API‚Äôs that can be tested on the local development box with the application running in Azure. And finally we will dive into some of the new capabilities in .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 to make your web services into single file executables that are both small and easy to host. Each section will cover a topic and then have exercises you can go through on your own computer.  When your done you should understand how to build API‚Äôs and services, host them in the variety of options that Azure provides and build small and performant API‚Äôs.</description>
