      <title>Mercury: Ultra-Fast Language Models Based on Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17298</link>
      <description>We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality frontier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall. We also release a public API at https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/ and free playground at https://chat.inceptionlabs.ai</description>

      <title>Belgium is unsafe for CVD</title>
      <link>https://floort.net/posts/belgium-unsafe-for-cvd/</link>
      <description>This post is about the reason I will probably never try to warn any organisation in Belgium about any vulnerability again. Recently I have been dealing with an attempt at coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) with an organisation in Belgium. This post is not about that, because I’m not allowed to write about it. This post explains why I believe Belgium is unsafe for people trying to do CVD. I believe it’s important to warn others so that they know what to expect and can decide for themselves.</description>

      <title>We've Issued Our First IP Address Certificate</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate/</link>
      <description>Since Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt started issuing certificates in 2015, people have repeatedly requested the ability to get certificates for IP addresses, an option that only a few certificate authorities have offered. Until now, they&amp;rsquo;ve had to look elsewhere, because we haven&amp;rsquo;t provided that feature.
Today, we&amp;rsquo;ve issued our first certificate for an IP address, as we announced we would in January. As with other new certificate features on our engineering roadmap, we&amp;rsquo;ll now start gradually rolling out this option to more and more of our subscribers.</description>

      <title>ToListAsync is fast again in Entity Framework (kind of)</title>

      <description>Last year I wrote an article about how ToListAsync was slow in Entity Framework titled: "Be careful with ToListAsync and ToArrayAsync in Entity Framework Core". Things have evolved since then, so let's celebrate!

      <title>Get the location of the ISS using DNS</title>
      <link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/get-the-location-of-the-iss-using-dns/</link>
      <description>I love DNS esoterica. Weird little things that you can shove in the global directory to be distributed around the world instantly(ish).  Domain names, like www.example.com usually resolve to servers. As much as we think of "the cloud" as being some intangible morass of ethereal Turing-machines floating in probability space, the more prosaic reality is that they're just boxen in data centres. They …</description>
