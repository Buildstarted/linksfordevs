      <title>A Supermarket Bag And a Truckload Of FOMO</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/03/a-little-adventure-in-modern-frontend</link>
      <description>The day was nearing to a close. The sun has already set, but that Friday evening in Amsterdam was still warm. Unusually warm, in fact, for those late days in March ‚Äì as if spring decided to bless my piligrimage, for that piligrimage was not jovial. I was sitting at a ramen joint, sipping on the broth. To my left, a blue, crinkled supermarket shopping bag was sitting solemnly, inconspicuously. Inside that bag sat a slightly used Mac Studio, which I have just purchased to be able to edit CSS of my own application. By the time that evening descended upon the south of Amsterdam, I have lost 3 days of my life trying to figure out why I was unable to edit CSS. But let me rewind a bit.</description>

      <title>Two Years Building Workbrew, a Remote-First Enterprise Homebrew Startup</title>
      <link>https://mikemcquaid.com/two-years-building-workbrew-a-remote-first-enterprise-homebrew-startup/</link>
      <description>TL;DR: I left GitHub after 10 years to cofound Raise.dev. After an early failed experiment building IoT developer tools, we pivoted and built Workbrew: an enterprise-friendly layer over Homebrew, a project I‚Äôve maintained since 2009 and led since 2019. Two years in, we‚Äôve raised VC funding, built a remote team, and have happy, paying customers. Here‚Äôs what I learned so far.</description>

Hello, everybody. I'm Nick, and in this video, I will talk about claims that .NET will not exist in 10 years and that it's old news. .NET is one of the coolest frameworks to work with so this is clearly an opinion of someone who has an agenda.

      <title>80/20 writing</title>
      <link>https://danbartlett.co.uk/80/20-writing/</link>
      <description>A popular approach to running is the 80/20 philosophy, popularised by Matt Fitzgerald. It says that runners improve most effectively when 80% of their running is at low intensity, with the remaining 20% done at higher intensity.
This approach recognises the value of high-volume, ‚Äúeasy‚Äù runs and aims to avoid what‚Äôs known as the ‚Äúgrey zone‚Äù of training. These are runs that are too hard to be easy and too easy to be hard. Research shows that this way of training provides limited aerobic benefit, whilst contributing significantly to fatigue. It‚Äôs a poor return on investment.</description>
