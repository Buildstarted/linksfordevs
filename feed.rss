      <description>Tucked under the belly of the Perseverance rover that will be landing on Mars in just a few days is a little helicopter called Ingenuity. Its body is the size of a box of tissues, slung underneath a pair of 1.2m carbon fiber rotors on top of four spindly legs. It weighs just 1.8kg, but the importance of its mission is massive. If everything goes according to plan, Ingenuity will become the first aircraft to fly on Mars.</description>

      <title>Vertical Farming Does Not Save Space</title>
      <link>https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2021/02/vertical-farming-ecosystem-services.html</link>
      <description>If the electricity for a vertical farm is supplied by solar panels, the energy production takes up at least as much space as the vertical farm saves. Urban agriculture in vertical, indoor “farms” is on the rise. Electric lights allow the crops to be grown in layers above each other year-round. Proponents argue that growers can save a lot of agricultural land in this way. Additional advantages are that less energy is needed to transport food (most people live in a city) and that less water and pesticides are required. Which crops? The vertical farms that have been commercially active for several years all focus on the same crops. These are agricultural products with a high water content, such as...</description>

      <title>CoreWCF 0.1.0 GA Release</title>
      <link>https://corewcf.github.io/blog/2021/02/19/corewcf-ga-release</link>
      <description>After 21 months of public development, CoreWCF has finally reached its first GA release. It’s been a long path to get here, and thee is still have a long way to go. CoreWCF started off as a prototype internal to Microsoft which was started after a meeting with Scott Hunter. During that meeting Scott said something which has shaped the entire development of CoreWCF. He said that we only want one service host (the concept, not the WCF ServiceHost class) in .NET Core. ASP.NET Core had already been released, which meant there wasn’t a place for ServiceHost (the WCF class). This made a lot of sense, so I set about building a WCF prototype on top of ASP.NET Core. Eventually a decision was made to release the prototype as a community project under the name CoreWCF. The prototype focused on the developer experience so a lot of the implementation needed some love and attention, and 21 months later, we’re releasing our first GA release. Along the way, the CoreWCF project caught the attention of the Amazon AWS team and they have been contributing significantly to help make this project a success. It is thanks to the contributions from Amazon AWS that the initial release supports WS-* protocols (WS-Security, WS-SecureConversation), and some token authentication credential types with the TransportWithMessageCredentials security mode. This is a significant step towards supporting WS-Federation to enable moving enterprise WCF services to CoreWCF hosted on a cloud platform.</description>

      <title>Paying for news — Benedict Evans</title>

      <description>We’ve been arguing about newspaper business models for a decade, and none of the questions have changed, but now things are heating up. Should internet platforms ‘pay for news content’, and is this a competition problem, or is this really a tax on links, and a subsidy?</description>

      <description>I love remote work, and I’ve been working remotely for the last five years, but
I think there are some serious downsides too. In spite what all the “remote work
is the future!” articles of the last year claim, it’s not all perfect, or
suitable for everyone.</description>

      <title>Futex Reacquainted</title>
      <link>https://tabokie.github.io/tech/2021/01/30/futex-reacquainted.html</link>
      <description>To be fair, the futex (Fast Userspace muTEX) syscall has a rather misleading name, in the sense that it simply isn’t a mutex. In the original 2002 paper (Fuss, Futexes and Furwocks: Fast Userlevel Locking in Linux), it was invented specifically to implement a fast mutex, but capable of much more. I prefer to think of futex as a minimal useful subset that can fulfil most high level synchronization constructs.</description>
