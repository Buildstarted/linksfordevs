      <description>Since a few years, the Ethereum Foundation and Community are working on a massive upgrade of the Ethereum protocol, that will switch Proof of Work consensus to Proof of Stake and introduce Sharding to scale the Ethereum chain.
One of the step of this upgrade is The Merge, which main goal is to switch the consensus of the chain to Proof of Stake.
The main advantages of this consensus change are:</description>

      <title>SPAs in ASP.NET Core - Another Attempt

      <title>Planting Undetectable Backdoors in Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06974</link>
      <description>Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train
machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service
provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor
into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves
normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the
classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,
without the appropriate &amp;quot;backdoor key&amp;quot;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be
detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks
for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.
  First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature
schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the
original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to
find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the
backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.
Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained
using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU
networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the
training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is
&amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; or contains a backdoor.
  Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related
issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction
can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an &amp;quot;adversarially
robust&amp;quot; classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In
summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant
theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.</description>
