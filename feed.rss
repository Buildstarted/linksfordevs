      <title>Hacker News now runs on top of Common Lisp - Lisp journey</title>
      <link>https://lisp-journey.gitlab.io/blog/hacker-news-now-runs-on-top-of-common-lisp/</link>
      <description>Hacker News was written in the Arc lisp dialect, a dialect created by Paul Graham. Arc was implemented on top of Racket, but that has now changed. HN runs on top of SBCL since a few months.But why? For performance reasons. I recently noticed that Hacker News no longer uses paging for long threads. In the past, when a discussion grew large, we had to click &amp;ldquo;More&amp;rdquo; to load the next page of comments, and dang would occasionally post helpful tips to remind us about this feature.</description>

      <title>Lieferando.de has captured 5.7% of restaurant related domain names</title>
      <link>https://mondaybits.com/lieferando-captured-6-percent-of-restaurant-related-domain-names/</link>
      <description>I recently decided to compile a very large list of domain names for the German country code top-level domain .de. I did this with the help of the Common Crawl project which provides a free, open repository of web crawl data and web graphs for the last years.

      <title>Google Shared My Phone Number!</title>
      <link>https://danq.me/2025/05/21/google-shared-my-phone-number/</link>
      <description>When people started calling my personal mobile number with questions about a voluntary organisation I'm involved with, I was confused: we weren't sharing that number. It turns out that Google had decided to take the number I used to verify my identity for Google Business some years prior and start putting it in Google Search results. WTF, Google?</description>

      <title>Avoiding reflection in C# in way unsafer ways!</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/53691229-fbb1-48cf-95e5-f586f9800ee1</link>
      <description>For good reasons, many folks don't want to use reflection. Since .NET 8, we have a better way of dealing with this in most of the cases (when known in advance). But we can go the opposite: Make it even unsafer for a tiny bit performance!

      <title>Rich: Enrich your CSVs with new columns</title>
      <link>https://blog.marcua.net/2025/05/22/rich-enrich-your-csvs-with-new-columns.html</link>
      <description>This week a fellow B12er was performing an ad-hoc data analysis. They had a spreadsheet with some data, and wanted to classify the rows in the spreadsheet by a few different criteria along which they would look for trends. For an engineer, this would have been a quick Python script wrapping some classifier (in our case, the OpenAI API), but there wasn‚Äôt an engineer available for the project. We looked at some third-party plugins for Google Sheets, but it wasn‚Äôt clear what sorts of guarantees they made around data privacy, and we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable installing them. So, with some help from OpenAI‚Äôs o3, I created Rich, an OpenAI-powered CSV data enricher that‚Äôs a fully client-side single-page application.</description>

      <title>A SomewhatMaxSAT Solver</title>
      <link>https://blog.jak-linux.org/2025/05/24/somewhatmax-sat-solver/</link>
      <description>As you may recall from previous posts and elsewhere I have been busy writing a new solver for APT. Today I want to share some of the latest changes in how to approach solving.
The idea for the solver was that manually installed packages are always protected from removals ‚Äì in terms of SAT solving, they are facts. Automatically installed packages become optional unit clauses. Optional clauses are solved after manual ones, they don‚Äôt partake in normal unit propagation.</description>

      <description>In small to mid-sized engineering teams, unchecked diversity in backend technology stacks can lead to increased cognitive load, fragmented knowledge, and reduced team mobility. While each language or tool may offer individual advantages, the lack of alignment often results in duplicated efforts, inconsistent practices, and slower progress</description>
