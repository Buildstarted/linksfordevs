      <description>I just got my first dimmer and installed it to some leds in my living room. The problem is that the leds will not turn off completely when I turn it off in the app or on the physical switch. It only dims down to maybe 40% and when I dim it down to 1%…</description>

      <title>Behind the scenes: the struggle for each paper</title>
      <link>https://jeffhuang.com/struggle_for_each_paper/</link>
      <description>The start of my sabbatical has given me a moment to reflect on my publications. But my CV only shows a list of neatly cataloged papers: title, authors, conference. Each one appearing no different from another. But how each paper ended up published is its own story, a story about people and opportunity.</description>

      <title>Figmage: I don&amp;#39;t mess with images</title>
      <link>https://heyraviteja.com/post/projects/figmage/</link>
      <description>I hate working with images. It’s the most tedious part of making websites and writing blog posts.
In fact, sometimes I dread it so much, that I don’t publish posts because I have to make the assets for them.
 too many images everywhere
  And if you muster up the energy to make them, it’s a cycle of uploads and re-uploads till you get the right resolution, size and colors.</description>
