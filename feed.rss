      <title>Large-Scale Vehicle Classification – Pickled ML</title>
      <link>https://blog.aqnichol.com/2022/12/31/large-scale-vehicle-classification/</link>
      <description>As a hobby project over the past few weeks, I’ve been training neural networks to predict the prices of cars in photographs. Anybody with some experience in ML can probably guess what I did, at least on a high level: I scraped terabytes of data from the internet and trained a neural network on it. However, I ended up learning more than I expected to along this journey. For example, this was the first time I’ve observed clear and somewhat surprising positive transfer across prediction tasks. In particular, I found that predicting additional details about each car (e.g. make and model) improved the accuracy of price predictions. Additionally, I learned a few things about file systems, specifically EXT4, that threw me off guard. And finally, I used AI-powered image editing to uncover some interesting behaviors of my trained classifier.</description>

      <title>Improving color quantization heuristics</title>
      <link>http://blog.pkh.me/p/39-improving-color-quantization-heuristics.html</link>
      <description>In 2015, I wrote an article about how the palette color quantization was
improved in FFmpeg in order to make nice animated GIF files. For some
reason, to this day this is one of my most popular article.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi security alarm — the basics</title>
      <link>https://blog.cavelab.dev/2022/12/rpi-security-alarm/</link>
      <description>In November last year — I started building a DIY security alarm system, using a Raspberry Pi as the controller. My plan was to make a self-sustained system, using proper alarm hardware — like PIR sensors and sirens.
Integration with Home Assistant would be an add-on, not a requirement. I wanted the system to be as redundant and fault-tolerant as I could make it.
This is a pretty long story, with some twists and turns — let’s get into it &amp;#128071;</description>

      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/part-of-the-wrong-1-perecent-ostomy-surgery-part-2</link>
      <description>About 1 percent of Americans have diagnosed Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) like Crohn&amp;#39;s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis. And about 1 in 500 Americans (0.2%) have ostomies—small openings called stomas that help when their bowels get really screwed up (whether through disease, cancer, or trauma).</description>

      <description>When I was in junior high, my friends and I discovered that a Command Prompt command called net send was enabled on our school network. AIM and similar services were blocked, but if we wanted to send messages to each other we could open up the Command Prompt and type something like:
net send lab2126-24 test and get an alert that looked like: The computer names were predictable, something like lab + room number + computer number, and the computer numbers were physically written on the machines themselves.</description>
