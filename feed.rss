      <title>Why Solid?</title>
      <link>https://noeldemartin.com/blog/why-solid</link>
      <description>For five years, I&amp;#39;ve dedicated most of my side-project time to making apps and tools using the Solid Protocol. Many share its vision, but it&amp;#39;s also common to hear criticisms. I&amp;#39;m often asked why I&amp;#39;m still working on Solid, or told about another project that is doing a better job at solving similar problems.
Today, I&amp;#39;ll go through some of the criticisms, share my own concerns, and answer why after all these years I&amp;#39;m still choosing Solid.

      <description>I have been working on an emulator for early (Motorola 68000-powered) Macintosh computers. While implementing the disk drive, I noticed documentation was scattered and hard to find. Now that I have a working implementation, this post is my attempt to document everything in one place.</description>

      <title>Home - Strandbeest</title>
      <link>https://www.strandbeest.com/</link>
      <description>Theo Jansen is engaged in creating new forms of life: the so called strandbeests. Skeletons made from yellow plastic tube (Dutch electricity pipe) are able to walk and get their energy from the wind. They have evolved since their inception in 1990 and have been divided into 12 periods of evolution. Their properties determine this period. You will find the most important types of strandbeests at geneology.</description>

      <link>https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/xaml-reuse-data-templates/</link>
      <description>XAML is often criticised for being verbose, hard to read and unnecessary as an additional language for defining the interface for an application. This feedback has lead to the creation of C# markup which works with both Windows UI / Windows App SDK and &amp;#160;Uno Platform applications. However, I find that the declarative nature and ...
