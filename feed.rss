      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0020-markrendle/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Mark Rendle to chat about his experiences live-coding/streaming on Twitch! Warning: We went on a lot of tangents during the conversation! It’s all good though - as they were all awesome tangents! We not only talked about streaming, but also Blazor, C#, Unity, the rate of tech advancement, teaching kids to code, and much more!
  Mark’s Bio Mark Rendle decided he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10, became a professional programmer when he was 16, and is still a programmer 30 years later.</description>

      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2021/07/22/debugging-javascript-dom-css-and-logging-console-without-leaving-visual-studio-code/</link>
      <description>Now that Visual Studio Code has an in-built JavaScript debugger, it has become incredibly convenient to debug your project without leaving the editor. You can debug JavaScript, tweak CSS and the DOM and interact with the browser Console right inside VS Code. And you don’t need to know which extensions to install as the editor guides you along the way.</description>

      <description>To be honest, I’ve always been sceptical about AI-based autocomplete. When I program, I’m deeply focused on a problem and I have my preferences on how to write code. Suggestions that pop up here and there are a huge distraction for me. That’s why tools like Kite or Tab Nine have never worked for me.

      <title>&amp;quot;In the age of information, ignorance is a choice.&amp;quot; Or is it?</title>
      <link>https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/post/ignorance/</link>
      <description>Six years ago I read this sentence by Donny Miller and became obsessed with it. “In the age of information, ignorance is a choice”. This is the age of information. I felt empowered, inspired, and most of all, I thought it was true as well.
I am a living example of how this can be true. I have a formal Engineering education, a luxury for many families. Yet, the concepts I learned during my engineering education contribute to maybe 1% of what I do today to earn a living.</description>

      <title>Reflections as the Internet Archive turns 25 - Internet Archive Blogs</title>
      <link>https://blog.archive.org/2021/07/21/reflections-as-the-internet-archive-turns-25/</link>
      <description>As a young man, I wanted to help make a new medium that would be a step forward from Gutenberg&amp;#39;s invention. By building a Library of Everything in the digital age, I thought the opportunity was not just to make it available to everybody in the world, but to make it better-- smarter than paper. By using computers, we could make the Library not just searchable, but organizable; make it so that you could navigate your way through millions, and maybe eventually billions of web pages.</description>
