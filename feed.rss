      <description>8 years after the first commit in the git repo, at the ask of
some package managers and users, I release QBE 1.0. All targets
are at parity thanks to great work from contributors, and QBE
is used somewhat seriously by a couple people.</description>

      <title>Whatever happened to SHA-256 support in Git?</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/898522/9cf50ee3f96f90c1/</link>
      <description>The news has been proclaimed
loudly and often: the SHA-1 hash algorithm is terminally broken and should
not be used in any situation where security matters.  Among other things,
this news gave some impetus to the longstanding
effort to support a more robust hash algorithm in the Git source-code
management system.  As time has passed, though, that work seems to have
slowed to a stop, leaving some users wondering when, if ever, Git will
support a hash algorithm other than SHA-1.</description>

      <title>MEGA: Malleable Encryption Goes Awry</title>
      <link>https://mega-awry.io/</link>
      <description>MEGA is a leading cloud storage platform with more than 250 million users and 1000 Petabytes of stored data, which aims to achieve user-controlled end-to-end encryption.
                We show that MEGA&amp;#39;s system does not protect its users against a malicious server and present five distinct attacks, which together allow for a full compromise of the confidentiality of user files.
                Additionally, the integrity of user data is damaged to the extent that an attacker can insert malicious files of their choice which pass all authenticity checks of the client.
                We built proof-of-concept versions of all the attacks, showcasing their practicality and exploitability.</description>

      <title>Introducing PyScript</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/898452/357b195db1ecce28/</link>
      <description>In a keynote at PyCon 2022 in Salt
Lake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of
in-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way
to be able to write Python—instead of JavaScript—to run in web browsers, and there
have been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop
one of those earlier projects, to allow
Python scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to
much of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact
with the browser document object model (DOM) directly. 
In addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk.</description>
