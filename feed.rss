      <description>If you're around my age, you'll remember Windows Minesweeper. It was one of several games included with Windows back in the day to try to train users in the use of the then-newfangled ‘mouse’. It doesn’t come with Windows any more. You can get Minesweeper for Windows 10, but the developers have… made some choices.</description>

      <title>Stateful Hash-Based Signatures | CSRC | CSRC</title>
      <link>https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/stateful-hash-based-signatures</link>
      <description>NIST plans to approve one or more schemes for stateful hash-based signatures (HBS) as part of the post-quantum cryptography development effort. NIST is actively considering two such schemes developed through the Internet Engineering Task Force: 1) XMSS, specified in Request for Comments (RFC) 8391 in May 2018, and 2) LMS, currently specified in RFC 8554.  Background  HBS schemes were the topic for a session of talks during the first public workshop on post-quantum security, as well as the panel discussion that followed it. Participants expressed significant interest in the standardization of such schemes at that time, because the underlying technology was well understood. In particular, the security of an HBS scheme, when implemented properly, relies only on the preimage resistance of its component cryptographic hash function. This property is already the basis for the security of many NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and no quantum computing algorithms are known that would pose a...</description>
