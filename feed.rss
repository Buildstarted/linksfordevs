      <link>https://nltimes.nl/2021/09/13/uber-must-employ-its-drivers-dutch-court-rules</link>

      <title>The C++/WinRT query_interface_tearoff extension point, and using it for COM aggregation</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210913-00/?p=105680</link>
      <description>The C++/WinRT library’s implements template does the heavy lifting of implementing COM classes. One of the extension points is a method called query_interface_tearoff. This method is called as part of the implementation of the IUnknown::Query&amp;#173;Interface method if the caller is asking for an interface that wasn’t declared as part of the implements type parameter list.</description>

On the contrary, the words “corporate politics” evoke memories of cynical executives in ‘90s movies quoting The Art of War to their reports while figuring out how to undermine their peers. One of the Merriam-Webster dictionary’s definitions of the word is “political activities characterized by artful and often dishonest practices.”</description>

      <title>Ray casting in 2D game engines</title>
      <link>https://sszczep.github.io/ray-casting-in-2d-game-engines/</link>
      <description>In my opinion, ray casting is a beautiful concept that is not that hard to grasp, but the quality resources are rare. We will learn the math behind it so you can implement it in your future projects with ease. I will try to make it as comprehensible as possible, explain all the caveats and issues you may stumble upon. We will also talk about optimization and how can spatial hash maps significantly help you. I will also provide some basic live examples for you to try out. Please note that demos were written to be as simple as possible, do not expect enterprise-grade code - we only learn about the concept, not the implementation.</description>
