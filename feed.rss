      <link>https://paulosman.me/2021/10/02/sociotechnical-lenses-into-software-systems/</link>
      <description>Software systems are sociotechnical. I don’t think software professionals spend enough time discussing the challenges that span software and personal aspects. When we look at software through a sociotechnical lens, we begin to appreciate the complexity inherent in software development and operations. The systems we are building and operating are constantly being modified by different people, with different contexts, at different times, who may or may not speak to each other directly.</description>

      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2021-11-02-improvements-to-spaced-repetition/</link>
      <description>Spaced repetition is not super widespread. It’s popular among med school students and language learners, but frequently people find the benefits outweighed by the costs, the friction too high, and they stop.
I believe the following are the most pressing issues to solve for spaced repetition to allow for wider adoption:
 Card creation: Zero friction card creation Card creation: Good cards by default Card maintenance: Eject bad cards quickly Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study more Schedule flexibility: Allow people to study less Review friction: Bring the reviews to the users  If we solve these six issues, I think that could open up spaced repetition to a much wider audience.</description>

      <title>How I created a Markdown parser</title>
      <link>https://bien.ee/blog/how-i-created-a-markdown-parser</link>
      <description>Let me begin this post by saying that I&amp;#39;m no genius, and I&amp;#39;ve peeked under the hood of a few other Markdown parsers, all of which with complexity that leaves me quite stunned. So when I set out to create my very own Markdown parser, I knew I had to figure out a simpler approach, and I think I did, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t include a full feature-set of a mainstream Markdown parser (yet).</description>

      <title>Implementing CHIP-8 in Jack</title>
      <link>https://abhaynayar.com/blog/chip8-in-jack.html</link>
      <description>In this post, I will go over how I implemented a CHIP-8 emulator using the
Jack language (from the
nand2tetris course). I thought this would be a fun project since I would be
programming an emulator that would run under another emulator that I had
previously programmed.</description>

      <title>Backdooring Rust crates for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://kerkour.com/rust-crate-backdoor/</link>
      <description>Supply chains attacks are all the rage these days, whether to deliver RATs, cryptocurrencies miners, or credential stealers.
In Rust, packages are called crates and are (most of the time) hosted on a central repository: https://crates.io for better discoverability.
We are going to study 8 techniques to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on developers&amp;#39;, CI/CD, or users&amp;#39; machines. I voluntarily ignored perniciously backdoored algorithms such as cryptographic primitives or obfuscated code because this is a whole different topic.</description>
