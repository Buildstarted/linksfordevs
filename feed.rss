      <link>https://snapsec.co/blog/Lastpass-Breach/</link>
      <description>One of the largest online password manager with Over 25 million users as of 2020. LastPass suffered a massive data breach recently.

But recent developments in the investigation show otherwise.</description>

      <title>There is no secure software supply-chain.</title>
      <link>https://onengineering.substack.com/p/there-is-no-secure-software-supply</link>
      <description>Years ago, entrepreneurs and innovators predicated that “software would eat the world”. And to little surprise, year after year, the world has become more and more reliant on software solutions. Often times, that software is (or indirectly depends on) some open source software, maintained by a group of people whose only affiliation to one another may be participation in that open source project’s community. But we’re in trouble. The security of open source software is under threat and we’re running out of people to reliably maintain those projects. And as our stacks get deeper, our dependencies become more interlinked, leading to terrifying compromises in the secure software supply-chain. For a perfect example of what’s happening in the open source world right now, we don’t need to look much further than the extremely popular</description>

      <link>https://zouhairj.com/notes/two-factor-authentication-2fa-attacks-and-how-to-protect-yourself/</link>
      <description>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide an additional form of authentication in addition to their login credentials. This helps to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to accounts and is widely used to protect online accounts, including email, social media, and financial accounts. However, like any security measure, 2FA</description>

      <title>Weird stuff and how to test it</title>
      <link>https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/weird-testing/</link>
      <description>Most software is simple: you have a codebase, and existing patterns for testing at a unit and integration level. But sometimes you&amp;#39;ll face problems that aren&amp;#39;t just adding code to an existing project, and don&amp;#39;t have an existing test suite to jump into. This posts shares some problems that required out-of-box thinking to find testing strategies, and gives advice on how you could use those techniques in your code.</description>

      <description>Could you use a markup syntax
that supports the full expressive power and richness of HTML or XML,
but is more terse, easier to type, and less frankly ugly?
To emphasize text, for example,
would it be nice just to write em[emphasize]
instead of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;emphasize&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;?
If so, pleae read on.</description>

      <description>Many know that you can take ReadOnlySpan&amp;lt;char&amp;gt; objects when dealing with strings. They give you a direct way of operating on the underlying memory. Often times you can use them interchangeably, but there are scenarios where you really have to watch out what is going on.
This blog post will have a look at a major problem with ReadOnlySpan when used like a &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; string.
