      <title>Why I don’t give investment advice — Andreas Fragner</title>
      <link>https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/investment-advice</link>
      <description>When people ask for advice on personal investing, I’ve found they are either looking for confirmation that what they do is great (it’s usually not) or some sort of secret sauce for outperforming the market (which doesn’t exist). So people are inevitably disappointed by the answer. The best advice fo</description>

      <link>https://blog.govindgnana.com/2023/07/08/anything-can-be-a-weekend-hack/</link>
      <description>On the unforeseeably large gap between demo and production, and the reification of patterns derived from a willingness that anything can, in fact, be a weekend hack—it’s just a matter of perspective, and a matter of what you’re willing to sacrifice (perhaps the integrity of what you’re building itself?).</description>

      <title>How Naming Shapes Our Conversations</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/naming-things-enables-conversations/</link>
      <description>At dinner the other day my Chinese dad brought up whether English had a term for the Chinese word 鲜. In fact, there is: umami. But it’s not a word common for English learners, and I think even native speakers may not use the word frequently or have encountered it at all, unless they have an interest in cooking.
The word itself, as you may be able to tell, is loaned from Japanese, which leads me to speculate that it wasn’t a concept that anglophones thought much of until more recent times.
But does that mean the taste didn’t exist? Presumably those taste buds were there the whole time. And yet, before I knew of the word umami I would kinda just round to the nearest concept, approximately “saltiness” or “savoriness”, and my understanding is that others do the same.
But that’s less than ideal.

            Fish are very umami and salty, but a food doesn&amp;#39;t have to be both

      <title>Fast Joins in Apache Beam</title>
      <link>https://ahalbert.com/technology/2023/07/08/fast_beam_joins.html</link>
      <description>At work, I was given a task of joining two different events coming in via a real time stream in Apache Beam. While joins are simple in a SQL batch job, they are significantly more challenging in real time streaming sytems. In a batch job, the data is bounded - it is finite and eventually will be exhausted. In a real time streaming sytem, the data is potentially infinite - it must be broken up into a bounded set of records or your join will take an infinite amount of time. In addition, data comes in at different times - how long should you wait to decide the other side of the join is never coming? One solution to these problems is windowing. Windowing is breaking a real time event stream into bounded pieces. One example of windowing is a fixed window.</description>
