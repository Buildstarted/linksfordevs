      <title>What is Near-rhyme or a Partial-rhyme - Brawnywriters</title>
      <link>https://brawnywriter.com/what-is-near-rhyme-or-a-partial-rhyme/</link>
      <description>Near-rhyme, also known as slant rhyme or partial rhyme, occurs when the ending sounds of two words are similar but not identical. For example, &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; are near rhymes because they share similar vowel sounds but end with different consonant sounds. Understanding near-rhyme is essential in poetry and songwriting because it can add complexity</description>

      <title>LLM Powered Assistants for Complex Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://nickarner.com/notes/llm-powered-assistants-for-complex-interfaces-february-26-2023/</link>
      <description>Text Interfaces Aren’t Enough The last few months of LLM development have been staggering. It’s been amazing to see how powerful chat-based interfaces, heralded by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can be. It’s inspired some to postulate that text is the universal interface, and for others to say that the humble text box is going to be the most important interface component there is.
This enthusiasm, understandable though it may be, risks creating the perception that any and all user interfaces can be more or less replaced with a chatbot or text-box based interface.</description>

      <description>Many things have been written about Imposter Syndrome. A condition that results in lower self-confidence, and a constant fear of being called out for being a phony. But I believe that Impostor Syndrome is as natural a process as puberty. Only when you truly begin to grow and amass knowledge do you realize just how</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing lots of experiments with GPT, though I’ve only written about one until now… the more serious something is the harder it is to call it finished or identify the outcomes. Here I’ll describe something a bit lighter: world building, or specifically city building, with GPT.</description>

      <title>The New XOR Problem</title>
      <link>https://blog.wtf.sg/posts/2023-02-03-the-new-xor-problem/</link>
      <description>In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry. In it, they showed that a single-layer perceptron cannot compute the XOR function. The main argument relies on linear separability: Perceptrons are linear classifiers, which essentially means drawing a line to separate input that would result in 1 versus 0. You can do it in the OR and AND case, but not XOR.
  Of course, we’re way past that now, neural networks with one hidden layer can solve that problem.</description>

      <title>Recreating ANSI Art from a screenshot</title>
      <link>https://bert.org/2023/02/27/recreating-ansi-art-from-a-screenshot/</link>
      <description>In the early to mid-90s, I ran a BBS out of my bedroom. It wasn’t very popular, but I did have a lot of time on my hands and I spent a lot of that time modding it. Initially, I wrote mods for myself, but eventually I started releasing them to other people. As a teenager, this was the first software that I wrote that other people used. This was my contribution to “the scene” and now my only claim to fame from that time is that I’m part of the final member list of ACiD Productions under BBS Modifications.</description>

      <description>Naturally, as you grow in your profession, you develop a vision and think about ideas and opportunities you can take to grow and have a more significant impact.
The natural process when these ideas come to mind is to add them to a never-ending to-do list. When I have time, I’ll propose that thing I’ve been thinking about for the last two months, you might think. Sometimes, it’s even worse. You forget about them.</description>

      <title>Performance (ReadOnly)List vs Immutable collection types</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/3bd2cb74-58a4-42cd-90e3-6c3a8befe854</link>
      <description>A bit back on LinkedIn, there was a discussion about read-only collection and immutability where this is not the point I want to discuss now, as I already covered that here: &amp;quot;ReadOnlyCollection is not an immutable collection&amp;quot;.
This post is just about the performance of those types compared to our baseline, the good old List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;. It also explains why we see the results we see.

      <title>Rust Coreutils: Fixing Low-Hanging Performance Fruit</title>
      <link>https://jackson.dev/post/rust-coreutils-dd/</link>
      <description>September 13, 2022
I have been toying with learning Rust for the last few years, but since I wasn’t able to use it at work it never really stuck with me. Throughout my career I mainly worked on low-latency C/C++ systems, and on performance engineering work directly (benchmarking, optimization work, etc) and Rust is trying to play in the same ballpark. Since retiring at the start of this year I’ve had a little more free time, so I’ve been spending more time writing Rust code for my personal projects and trying to contribute to some Rust OSS projects to get a feel for the language.</description>
