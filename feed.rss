      <title>CoreWCF 1.0.0 Release</title>
      <link>https://corewcf.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/corewcf-1_0_0_release</link>
      <description>Today we&amp;#39;ve hit a big milestone and have released version 1.0.0 of CoreWCF. This is the end of the beginning of a long journey for me that started just over 5 years ago back in January of 2017. I was given 3 weeks to put together a basic prototype of what a WCF service implementation would look like built on .NET Core. At the end of the 3 weeks, I had a working implementation which could host a service using BasicHttpBinding. My prototype then sat there gathering dust as a proof of concept while it was decided what to do with it. There weren&amp;#39;t the resources to develop this into a full product with feature parity to WCF, but there were many customers blocked unable to move to .NET Core without doing a complete rewrite of their service. It was eventually decided that I would spend some time cleaning up my prototype implementation, including adding NetTcp support, and the code would be donated to the open source community to see if this was something that a community would build around for it to live outside of Microsoft.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Pair Programming</title>

      <description>In traditional pair programming, two trusted developers are assigned to work jointly on writing sections of software. This article explores an adversarial pair programming concept where two anonymous developers code together under the assumption the other person is malicious.</description>

      <title>Creating Offline Custom Style Maps With tileserver-gl - Yasoob Khalid</title>
      <link>https://yasoob.me/posts/custom-map-with-tileserver-gl/</link>
      <description>Hi lovely people! &amp;#128075; Last year, I saw a project on Product Hunt which allowed people to generate posters from maps. The website has since closed down and the company has been acquired by Airbnb. This is what the output looked like:
Now, I was interested in figuring out how they were able to render this map. My experience with maps was limited to Google Maps only so I was excited to explore the world of custom map generation.</description>

      <link>https://quix.us/essays/YourOpinionDoesntMatter.html</link>
      <description>The current &amp;quot;race&amp;quot; debate (or lack thereof) is essentially about the honoring of 
opinions from one side, but not the other. There is no equal footing here. 
The only way to get on common ground is to put both sides in an equivalent 
place - Only my opinion and worldview matters to me and the attitudes of 
others are irrelevant. Now, we are both fighting with swords.</description>

      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2022/04/27/alpine-js-for-web-interaction/</link>
      <description>After working with lots of these little JavaScript libraries, sometimes I pine for something simple

      <title>Exploring Architectural Concepts Building a Card Game </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/exploring-architecture-building-game/</link>
      <description>One of the things I missed during the pandemic were my friends, the possibility to meet them, discuss with them and, why not, play cards with them.

      <title>Microsoft finds new elevation of privilege Linux vulnerability, Nimbuspwn - Microsoft Security Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/04/26/microsoft-finds-new-elevation-of-privilege-linux-vulnerability-nimbuspwn/</link>
      <description>Microsoft has discovered several vulnerabilities, collectively referred to as Nimbuspwn, that could be chained together, allowing an attacker to elevate privileges to root on many Linux desktop endpoints. Leveraging Nimbuspwn as a vector for root access could allow attackers to achieve greater impact on vulnerable devices by deploying payloads and performing other malicious actions via arbitrary root code execution.</description>
