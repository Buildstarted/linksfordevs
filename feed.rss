      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/12/linkedin-grpc-protobuf-rest-json/</link>
      <description>LinkedIn announced that it would be moving to gRPC with Protocol Buffers for the inter-service communication in its microservices platform, where previously an open-source Rest.li framework was used with JSON as a primary serialization format.

At the request of some recent class attendees, I’m putting this online. If you’re a product manager or owner, you could use this to self evaluate and identify areas where you could improve.</description>

      <description>It is safe to assert that the majority of Apple users haven&amp;#39;t read the terms of
service they agree to when using services such as App Store, Find My, or
iCloud. Even without having read those terms, I think most users might not be
surprised to hear that Apple can revoke your Apple account permanently.</description>
