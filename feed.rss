      <title>Stop Letting Algorithms Define Your Relationships</title>
      <link>https://kwakubiney.github.io/posts/Stop-Letting-Algorithms-Define-Your-Relationships/</link>
      <description>Why do we give social media so much power over our lives? I‚Äôm fairly young, but I‚Äôve had a good experience of life without social media as it exists today. There was a time when we gauged how close certain friends were using much more realistic metrics‚Äîbut it seems that‚Äôs lost among the youth now. I recently got into an argument with a friend, mainly because she was not my number one best friend on Snapchat, and I was very confused. If you don‚Äôt use Snapchat a lot, you probably won‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, so here‚Äôs some brief context. Social media platforms like Snapchat assign ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù tags to people you interact with, based on some algorithm that obviously isn‚Äôt public. Now, was this person wrong for being jealous? Maybe not. But I‚Äôm alarmed at the level of trust and reliance people place on such tagging to make real life decisions. I‚Äôm not sure how the tagging works exactly, but the more you interact with someone, the higher they appear on your best friend list. My issue is with Snapchat. Judging who my best friend is based solely on conversation frequency is weird. Conversations have so much more depth to them‚Äîcontext matters. Overall, I just feel like I should be able to opt out of that feature entirely, so I don‚Äôt appear on anyone‚Äôs best friend list and no one appears on mine. I can only control what I can control, so I‚Äôve deleted Snapchat and ended the friendship.</description>

      <title>Ideas for Super Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/asi/</link>
      <description>This essay is about the nature and character of algorithms that would lead to artificial super intelligence (ASI) primarily through recursive self improvement. It is a window into my intuitions at the current time.
current bottlenecks OpenAI just recently released a long form podcast talking about primarily pre-training gpt4.5 and the various lessons that it taught them. I never thought I would see such transparency from OpenAI and it serves as valuable insight into the current state of ML research.</description>

      <title>How Claude avoids JSON accuracy issue in tool calling</title>
      <link>https://arcfu.com/post/claude-json-solution/</link>
      <description>There‚Äôs an article from Aider that demonstrates reduced accuracy of code generation in LLMs when using tool calls.
In essence, their exercise demonstrates that asking an LLM to return JSON reduces the accuracy of code generation.
Reduced accuracy { "file_path": "package.json", "content": "{"name": "test"}" }  Better ``` // package.json {"name": "test"} ```  The primary hypothesis is that since per-token computation is limited, a part of the computation is instead directed toward getting proper escaping.</description>

                flick of the power switch, the CRT monitor hums to life, degaussing into
                a shaky boot sequence. Lines of text scroll down the screen, and
                finally, the familiar prompt C: awaits your command.</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding without worry or care</title>
      <link>https://prashanth.world/carefree-careless/</link>
      <description>Without a worry
At this point in time, Vibe Coding is probably even past the hype cycle. Just describing to cursor what you want to do and having the editor generally get it right has been extremely liberating for me and many people. My drive to build things in software had waned, mainly because setting up new projects tended to be a lot of busywork. But with Cursor those pieces of busywork are now hyper automated. I don‚Äôt have to worry about being derailed due to e.g. updated interfaces to libraries, I can just tell Cursor to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù and continue my main quest.
