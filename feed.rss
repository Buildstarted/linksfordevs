      <title>The LLM productivity puzzle — Andreas Fragner</title>

      <description>Code generation is arguably one of the most interesting applications of LLMs, and it’s quickly gained traction (Copilot/Codex, Codegen, etc.). If you spend time on the internet these days you’ll see people claim productivity gains ranging from 0 to 100x, selection-biased to the high end. Whenever yo</description>

      <title>Delimited files are hell-- a comparison of methods to read bad files</title>
      <link>https://json.blog/2023/01/21/delimited-files-are.html</link>
      <description>Here’s a real live example of why I am stuck with R and stuck with data.table. In my work, I often receive various delimited files from customers. Mostly, these delimited files are created from Oracle or MS SQL and have all kinds of gnarly things going on. Without sharing too much, here’s a partial example of the last few fields of one line in one of those files:

      <description>Good advice is very difficult to give. This is because it is inherently context dependent. Advice is inextricably linked with the lived experience of the person giving the advice. No matter how well conceived or written, the value of advice is limited by its applicability to a given situation.</description>

      <title>Self-serve feature platforms: architectures and APIs</title>
      <link>https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/08/self-serve-feature-platforms.html</link>
      <description>The last few years saw the maturation of a core component of the MLOps stack: feature platforms. A feature platform handles feature engineering, feature computation, and serving computed features for models to use to generate predictions. Many companies -- Airbnb, LinkedIn, Snap, Meta, etc. -- have publicly discussed the architecture and use cases of their feature platforms. The first part discusses the evolution of feature platforms, how they differ from model platforms and feature stores. The second part discusses the core challenges of making feature platforms self-serve for data scientists and increase the iteration speed for feature engineering.</description>

      <title>Consciousness and Materialism | Luke&amp;#39;s Webpage</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/consciousness-and-materialism/</link>
      <description>Hume’s Parallel David Hume has often been quoted for his “Is” vs. “Ought” distinction. The argument is that fact and morality are two different domains, and from no accumulation of statements of fact alone can we ever jump to a statement of morality.
We can say statements of fact such as:
To be murdered is potentially painful. To be murdered is irreversible. Murder causes social dysfunction. Etc. … By merely my collecting these, we haven’t proven that Murder is evil.</description>
