      <title>An Empirical Study &amp;amp; Evaluation of Modern CAPTCHAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12108</link>
      <description>For nearly two decades, CAPTCHAs have been widely used as a means of protection against bots. Throughout the years, as their use grew, techniques to defeat or bypass CAPTCHAs have continued to improve. Meanwhile, CAPTCHAs have also evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming increasingly difficult to solve for both bots (machines) and humans. Given this long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is critical to investigate how long it takes legitimate users to solve modern CAPTCHAs, and how they are perceived by those users.
  In this work, we explore CAPTCHAs in the wild by evaluating users&amp;#39; solving performance and perceptions of unmodified currently-deployed CAPTCHAs. We obtain this data through manual inspection of popular websites and user studies in which 1,400 participants collectively solved 14,000 CAPTCHAs. Results show significant differences between the most popular types of CAPTCHAs: surprisingly, solving time and user perception are not always correlated. We performed a comparative study to investigate the effect of experimental context -- specifically the difference between solving CAPTCHAs directly versus solving them as part of a more natural task, such as account creation. Whilst there were several potential confounding factors, our results show that experimental context could have an impact on this task, and must be taken into account in future CAPTCHA studies. Finally, we investigate CAPTCHA-induced user task abandonment by analyzing participants who start and do not complete the task.</description>

      <description>Is your website ready to handle intense usage scenarios like DDoS attacks or black friday? Many people think that testing performance is the same as testing for load - but it&amp;#39;s not and sometimes it might even work against each other.</description>

      <title>Http.sys Delegation</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/httpsys-delegation.html</link>
      <description>Http.sys delegation is a kernel level feature added into newer versions of Windows which allows a request to be transferred from the receiving process&amp;#39;s http.sys queue to a target process&amp;#39;s http.sys queue with very little overhead or added latency. For this delegation to work, the receiving process is only allowed to read the request headers. If the body has started to be read or a response has started, trying to delegate the request will fail. The response will not be visible to the proxy after delegation, which limits the functionality of the session affinity and passive health checks components, as well as some of the load balancing algorithms. Internally, YARP leverage&amp;#39;s ASP.NET Core&amp;#39;s IHttpSysRequestDelegationFeature</description>
