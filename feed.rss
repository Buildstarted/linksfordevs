      <title>Programming with Proofs for High-assurance Software</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGIlWfnuTKA</link>
      <description>Programming critical systems with proofs, a long-standing goal of computer science, is beginning to come within reach of modern programming languages and proof assistants. I provide a brief overview of recent accomplishments in this space, related to work in the F* proof assistant and Project Everest, one of its flagship applications. Programs developed in F* with proofs of correctness are now deployed in wide variety of settings, ranging from Microsoft Windows and Hyper-V, Microsoft Azure, the Linux kernel, Firefox, mbedTLS, and several others production systems.

F* functional programming language: https://fstar-lang.org

      <title>Life is Short</title>
      <link>http://paulgraham.com/vb.html</link>
      <description>Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder
about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining
about its finiteness?  Would we be just as likely to feel life was
short if we lived 10 times as long?</description>
