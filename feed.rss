      <title>In Praise of Wasting Your Time</title>
      <link>https://shubhamjain.co/2023/12/12/in-praise-wasting-your-time/</link>
      <description>

I first felt the urge to “fix” my productivity almost twelve years back. As an anxious teen, I was only beginning to understand the number of skills that I could learn, books I could read, and things I could do. I had an overwhelming sense of preciousness of time; that wasting it was almost immoral. 

I must have toyed with all to discipline myself. Blocking websites, setting goals, and trying all sorts of productivity tricks to make sure I was cramming as many “productive things” in my day as possible. Nothing worked. I mean, it did for a while, until it didn’t. 

In every case, I ultimately succumbed to the “evil” called procrastination. A key feature of my 20s was a combination of anxiety and guilt seeing how I was failing the high standards I had set for myself. 

-----------------


Recently, the absurdity of all of it hit me. 

The expectations that I had for myself weren’t my expectations at all. They were of the society I lived in, and the stories I had consumed. The associated guilt of “wasting time” was nonsensical. There’s no one at the end of the tunnel grading me on how I used my time. Time as a resource to be used is a human invention. As Oliver Brukeman writes in his book,  “[Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54785515)”:

&amp;gt; The medieval farmer simply had no reason to adopt such a bizarre idea in the first place. Workers got up with the sun and slept at dusk, the lengths of their days varying with the seasons. There was no need to think of time as something abstract and separate from life: you milked the cows when they needed milking and harvested the crops when it was harvest time, and anybody who tried to impose an external schedule on any of that—for example, by doing a month’s milking in a single day to get it out of the way, or by trying to make the harvest come sooner—would rightly have been considered a lunatic.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; There was no anxious pressure to “get everything done,” either, because a farmer’s work is infinite: there will always be another milking and another harvest, forever, so there’s no sense in racing toward some hypothetical moment of completion. 

In rural parts of the world, it’s fascinating how casually people “waste” their time, because they are under no pressure to utilize it efficiently. 


&amp;gt; Tea or chai is a staple drink of the Afghan people and the tea house—the chai shop—is a favorite meeting place. Throughout the day you will find groups of men sitting around drinking tea and talking and this is an important and integral part of their social life. In general, the Afghan has time for himself and others. He’s not tied to 9-5 routine as most people in the west are. Here the time has quite a different meaning and it’s one thing that even the poorest man is a master of.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt; [Afghanistan before the Russian Invasion (Documentary, 1979)](https://youtu.be/fHPrU7R8L2Y?si=3062fcTtFxmbR7vp&amp;amp;t=2163)

In contrast, we are habitually in a race to keep doing more and more things, and to keep raising the bar. I look back and see how on days when I did nothing induced a tremendous amount of guilt in me. But why? How exactly had I failed? Who was I failing?

This is not to take away credit from personal growth, which is awesome, but being constantly under pressure to utilize time doesn’t sound very healthy to me. In fact, I now believe it harms more than it helps. It harms because the mind is clouded with the thoughts of ‘need’ to do something, restraining the ‘free-flowing creativity’. 

-----------------

In Chinese philosophy, specifically Taoism, [_wu wei_](https://1000wordphilosophy.com/2019/06/03/wu-wei-acting-without-desire/) (“effortless action”) is the practice of doing things without excessive effort or desired outcomes. It’s the state when our actions align with the _Dao_, an abstract concept that describes the natural order of things. The modern-day term for this would be ‘being in the flow’. We must have all experienced flow at some point, where work just flowed effortlessly. It’s because our actions are aligned with what we want deeply. We are not forcing ourselves to do things.

No surprise that productivity-obsessed mindset often gets in the way of _wu wei_. We might think reading a book was worth our ‘precious time’, but if it was finished out of compulsion, and not genuine interest, we would neither enjoy it nor get much out of it.  

Similarly, we can force ourselves to finish an article, but if our mind is utterly opposed to ‘writing the damn thing’, an eternity would be wasted ‘feeling blocked’ and the result might not even be pretty. Long term, we might even burn ourselves out. 

Seldom it’s realized that it’s easier to get things done by letting things take their due time. Most writers have experienced that writing is sometimes better served when abandoned, and returned to on the next day. Yet, they fail to connect the dots. It&amp;#39;s a difficult concept to grasp that unsolved problems are better solved when we are not thinking about them. 

-----------

I no longer define my life by how much productive I am. I do make an effort to do things, but I am happy wasting a weekend not doing much at all.  My #1 priority is to do work that feels natural to me, and keep my creative spirit alive and healthy, not finish 100 books because someone on Twitter did it too.

      <description>It’s been about a year since
the core prr features features went in. From my
perspective, one surprising thing is that there’s now a small group of
dedicated users who not only report bugs, but are also willing to
implement new features! Speaking for myself, the only thing better to a
maintainer than happy users are happy users who also send high quality
PRs.</description>

      <title>Episode 62: Speed mentoring and the power of Community - with Mia Gordon</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0062-speedmentoring/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Mia Gordon to chat about speed mentoring! I was recently invited to a speed mentoring event that she organised, and it was such a fun event and great idea and concept - that I invited her onto the show to chat about it! We also spoke about the power of community, and how big a difference it can make to your career and life.</description>

      <title>What if an SQL Statement Returned a Database?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00638</link>
      <description>Every SQL statement is limited to return a single, possibly denormalized, table. This design decision has far reaching consequences. (1.) for databases users in terms of slow query performance, long query result transfer times, usability-issues of SQL in web applications and object-relational mappers. In addition, (2.) for database architects it has consequences when designing query optimizers leading to logical (algebraic) join enumeration effort, memory consumption for intermediate result materialization, and physical operator selection effort. So basically, the entire query optimization stack is shaped by that design decision. In this paper, we argue that the single-table limitation should be dropped. We extend the SELECT-clause of SQL by a keyword &amp;#39;RESULTDB&amp;#39; to support returning a result database. Our approach has clear semantics, i.e. our extended SQL returns subsets of all tables with only those tuples that would be part of the traditional (single-table) query result set, however without performing any denormalization through joins. Our SQL-extension is downward compatible. Moreover, we discuss the surprisingly long list of benefits of our approach. First, for database users: far simpler and more readable application code, better query performance, smaller query results, better query result transfer times. Second, for database architects, we present how to leverage existing closed source systems as well as change open source database systems to support our feature. We propose a couple of algorithms to integrate our feature into both closed-source as well as open source database systems. We present an initial experimental study with promising results.</description>

      <title>House Intelligence Committee FISA “Reform” Bill Would Greatly Expand the Class of Businesses and Other Entities Required to Assist in FISA 702 Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-reform-bill-702-surveillance/</link>
      <description>Yesterday the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously approved the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 (FRRA), which would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA 702).&amp;#160;The full House is expected to vote on this bill next Tuesday.&amp;#160;Like other competing reauthorization bills that have been introduced (see&amp;#160;here&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;here), the FRRA would impose new restrictions on the government’s access to and use of information about U.S. persons that has been incidentally acquired pursuant to FISA 702, a provision that permits the government to conduct warrantless surveillance of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Although the FRRA is ostensibly a reform bill, it contains one notable provision that would&amp;#160;significantly expand&amp;#160;the government’s authority under FISA 702 by broadening the definition of “electronic communication service providers” (ECSPs) whom the government may compel to assist in FISA 702 surveillance.&amp;#160;The statutory definition of ECSP currently covers: (1) a telecommunications carrier;&amp;#160; (2)...</description>

      <description>This post is the first in an occasional series on building a distributed system using Akka.NET. Check back as I add to this series.
I was reminded of how much the Actor Model influenced me as a developer when I recently read Petabridge’s post about reflecting on 10 years of building Akka.NET. At first I thought, “oh my goodness - it’s been 10 years!!” and reflected on how much my life has changed over those 10 years.</description>
