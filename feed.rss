      <title>Running Julia on an Android Device</title>
      <link>https://rick2047.github.io/Julia-On-phone/</link>
      <description>A few days ago I was bored. The only good cure I know of boredom is smashing things together to see if they can work together. This incidentally is also why I love Julia, composability is a stated primary goal. I’ve smashed julia packages together before, and heard the satisfying click first hand. But that is a post for a later date. That day my boredom lead me to making julia work on my android phone.

The Why To oversimplify my need, I will quote this from the Readability Project
 Reading anything on the Internet has become a full-on nightmare. As media outlets attempt to eke out as much advertising revenue as possible, we’re left trying to put blinders on to mask away all the insanity that surrounds the content we’re trying to read.</description>

      <description>With the convergence between the multicore and standard runtime across OCaml 4.10.0 to 4.13.0 [6], the development of OCaml multicore has reached a point where further integration into OCaml’s main branch requires fully committing to a switch to OCaml multicore.  The OCaml team has decided that the time has come for such a commitment.  The new major version, OCaml 5, will be a multicore version of OCaml.  Moreover, OCaml 4.14 will be the last minor release of the 4.x series of OCaml.   Multicore...</description>
