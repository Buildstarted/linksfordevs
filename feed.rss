      <link>https://zeroequalsfalse.com/posts/it-is-ok-to-only-code-at-work/</link>
      <description>There is often pressure inside Software development for Software developers to code outside of work hours. Whether you are a Python, Ruby, Java, or any other developer... There is absolutely no need to code outside of work if you don't want too. Coding is considered a passion for some, but others they don't think this way. They are more than happy to not read a line of code in their spare time.</description>

      <title>The kernel and BitKeeper part ways</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/130746/</link>
      <description>Back in early 1999, your editor got a call from Larry McVoy.  He was
worried that Linus Torvalds was on the verge of burning out as the kernel
project grew.  The problems in those days were quite evident; Linus, it was
being said, did not scale.  But, according to Larry,
a complete burnout was not inevitable.  If Linus could be given the right
tools, many of his problems (and the frustrations of other kernel
developers) could be solved, and the system would run smoothly again.  The
right tool, according to Larry, was a thing called BitKeeper; if some sort
of agreement could be made on licensing, Larry (along with his company, BitMover)
was willing to make 
BitKeeper available for kernel development.  In fact, Larry wanted to see
BitKeeper used for all free software development; see this article from the 
March 25, 1999 LWN Weekly Edition for a view of how things looked at
that time.</description>

So, I created my first Chrome Extension! It shows me a list of my most recent videos and allows me to copy the link directly!

      <title>Workshop: Hack Yourself First: How to go on the Cyber-Offence - Day 1/2 - NDC TechTown 2020</title>
      <link>https://ndctechtown.com/talk/workshop-hack-yourself-first-how-to-go-on-the-cyber-offence-day-1-2/</link>
      <description>Day 1/2
&lt;br&gt;
Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>PDF: Still Unfit for Human Consumption, 20 Years Later</title>
      <link>https://www.nngroup.com/articles/pdf-unfit-for-human-consumption/</link>
      <description>Research spanning 20 years proves PDFs are problematic for online reading. Yet they’re still prevalent and users continue to get lost in them. They’re unpleasant to read and navigate and remain unfit for digital-content display.</description>

      <description>Have you ever seen a presentation using Visual Studio, but had a hard time seeing the too-small fonts in the editor, Solution Explorer and menu system? How about all the custom extensions and themes the presenter used, making it harder to figure out what exactly was going on?</description>

      <title>Reactive Extensions for .NET | endjin</title>
      <link>https://endjin.com/what-we-think/talks/reactive-extensions-for-dotnet.html</link>
      <description>The Reactive Extensions for .NET (&amp;quot;Rx&amp;quot; for short) are a set of libraries for working with asynchronous and event-based information sources. While Rx has become widely adopted in client-side code, its roots are in highly scalable server-side processing.
In this talk, Ian Griffiths shows why Rx should be a critical part of any .NET developer's toolbox, and shows a real-world application that illustrates how the powerful processing and orchestration facilities Rx provides can be applied to collect and process data in edge devices and then stream the high-value events to an Azure IoT hub for further analysis in the cloud.

      <title>Tip 273 - Getting started with Azure Image Builder</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip273.html</link>
      <description>Having standard Virtual Machine (VM) images can help you to make sure that your VMs are all configured the same and have the same properties and security policies applied to them. You can create VM images with the Azure Image Builder. This allows you to define VM images in json format, store them somewhere (like in the Azure Shared Image Gallery), build them and deploy them into VMs.</description>
