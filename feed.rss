      <title>Supporting Linux kernel development in Rust</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/829858/281103f9c6fd0dc2/</link>
      <description>The Rust programming language
has long aimed to be a suitable replacement for C in operating-system
kernel development.  As Rust has matured, many developers have expressed
growing interest in using it in the Linux kernel. At the 2020 (virtual) Linux Plumbers Conference, the
LLVM microconference track hosted a session
on open questions about and 
obstacles to accepting Rust upstream in the Linux kernel.  The interest in
this topic can be seen in the fact that this was the single most heavily
attended session at the 2020 event.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Half type! | .NET Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-half-type/</link>
      <description>The IEEE 754 specification defines many floating point types, including: binary16, binary32, binary64 and binary128. Most developers are familiar with binary32 (equivalent to float in C#) and binary64 (equivalent to double in C#). They provide a standard format to represent a wide range of values with a precision acceptable for many applications.</description>

      <title>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</title>
      <link>https://aosabook.org/en/index.html</link>
      <description>Architects look at thousands of buildings during their
            training, and study critiques of those buildings written
            by masters.  In contrast, most software developers only
            ever get to know a handful of large programs
            well—usually programs they wrote
            themselves—and never study the great programs of
            history.  As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes
            rather than building on one another's successes.</description>

One of the most common excuses is that we don’t know enough to start. We tell ourselves that we’ll start doing after we’ve learned more.

      <title>No longer looking for shortcuts!</title>
      <link>https://jamalx31.com/post/no-longer-looking-for-shortcuts</link>
      <description>When I look back at the last five years and my three failed businesses, I clearly see why they failed. It had nothing to do with the idea, the customers, or the circumstances (which I always blamed) and had everything to do with my obsession with doing things fast instead of doing things right. I was in a race with myself, and all I was thinking of was the finish line. I quit after the first try because I was looking for a shortcut to success.</description>

      <title>1st Game: Snek - Making an 8 Bit pipelined CPU</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efLzgweF958</link>
      <description>In the last video I added the UART that I've been developing as a side series. For the first time I had both input and output in the build so I spent some time writing the first game.  I chose an implementation of the classic "Snake" presented here in ASCII with ANSI color escape sequences. I'm using putty as a terminal emulator running on my pc. 

This is just a brief demo to showcase the game, it's not going to win any game development awards but it is a big milestone in the cpu build. I do throw in a few comments about the next steps. 

No, it's not Crysis.</description>

      <title>App Review process updates - News - Apple Developer</title>
      <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=84w3e5bm</link>
      <description>The App Store is dedicated to providing a great experience for everyone. To continue offering a safe place for users to download apps and helping you successfully develop apps that are secure, high-quality, reliable, and respectful of user privacy, we’ve updated the app review process as announced at WWDC20. For apps that are already on the App Store, bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal issues. You’ll instead be able to address guideline violations in your next submission. And now, in addition to appealing decisions about whether an app violates guidelines, you can suggest changes to the guidelines. We also encourage you to submit your App Store and Apple development platform suggestions so we can continue to improve experiences for the developer community.

      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/iasyncdisposable-dispose-resources-asynchronously</link>
      <description>It’s no secret that JetBrains Rider is my IDE of choice. The JetBrains team’s ability to stay current with language additions has helped me keep my C# knowledge relevant in a fast-paced world. It’s always exciting to see refactoring recommendations, and while it’s easy to hit Alt+Enter, I like to understand why I’m about to apply a change.</description>

      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/08/31/inject-service-into-system-text-json-converter/</link>
      <description>Most JSON converters are fairly simple, and typically self-contained. But once in a while, you need to do something a little more complex in a converter, and you end up needing to call a service.
