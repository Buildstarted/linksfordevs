      <description>In the summer of 1998 I graduated from college and went to work as a programmer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. I was put on the group that was building MSN Messenger Service, Microsoft‚Äôs instant messaging app. The terrible name came from Marketing, which had become something of a joke for always picking the clunkiest and least imaginative product names. Buddy List? C U C Me? MSN Messenger? No, MSN Messenger Service. I‚Äôll call it Messenger for short.</description>

      <title>InnoDB Internals - Consistent Reads</title>
      <link>https://yizhang82.dev/innodb-internals-consistent-reads</link>
      <description>Overview I‚Äôve been doing some research in this area trying to understand how this works in databases (for my upcoming project), so I thought I‚Äôd share some of my learnings here. InnoDB internally uses ReadView to establish snapshots for consistent reads - basically giving you the point-in-time view of the database at the time when the snapshot it is created. In InnoDB, all changes are immediately made on the latest version of Database regardless whether it has been committed or not, so if you don‚Äôt have MVCC, everybody will see the latest version of rows and it‚Äôll be a disaster for consistency. Not to mention you‚Äôll need to be able to rollback the changes. In order to achieve this, InnoDB maintains a undo log to track a link list of changes made by other transactions, so reading in the past with a snapshot means going from the latest record in the BufferPool, and walk backwards to find the first visible change. Rollback is similar. This also means the undo log can‚Äôt be purged if the snapshot is still active, and undo log will get longer and longer, which slows down the reads more and more. This is the infamous long running transaction issue. The fundamental issue is that you need to be able to determine visibility of changes. This is done with two things: InnoDB tracks the trx_id_t of each rows and in the undo log InnoDB internally use a data structure called ReadView to determine if a transaction is visible in the snapshot. So the algorithm becomes as simple as walking the list backwards and find the first visible record.</description>

      <title>Writing a curriculum vit√¶</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/cv/</link>
      <description>I have been giving a lot of feedback about how to write a better
curriculum vit√¶¬†(CV) recently. This post is a way of structuring
and disseminating my thoughts on this matter. As a start, let me briefly
delineate what this post is not about: I am not discussing how to
write a resume. A resume is typically only a single page long and
should provide all information pertinent to a very specific job. A CV,
by contrast, can be any length and usually contains all details
pertinent to your professional life.</description>

      <title>Reviews of distributed filesystems | Regressionist</title>
      <link>http://www.regressionist.com/2020/06/20/reviews-of-distributed-filesystems/</link>
      <description>I have a lot of data to work with, and I want to do it with just my mismatched bunch of servers, desktops, SSDs, and spinning disks. My equipment is old, so I want a filesystem that is robust not only to the failure of any drive, but also to the failure of any one machine. My preference is to build a hyper-converged system, where each machine hosts data in addition to working on compute jobs. Following are reviews I found on the main open-source distributed filesystems out there:</description>

      <description>A log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree) is a data structure that is typically used when dealing with write-heavy workloads. The write path is optimized by only performing sequential writes. LSM trees are the core data structure behind many databases including including BigTable, Cassandra, Scylla, and RocksDB.

      <description>The song draws inspiration from an incident on March 18th, 2016 involving a house in North Carolina Cole had rented to use as a studio, called the ‚ÄúSheltuh.‚Äù The house was raided by SWAT team members after complaints from neighbors who assumed the house was being used to produce and sell drugs. To the neighbors' surprise, no drugs were found in the ‚ÄúSheltuh,‚Äù just a recording studio in the basement.</description>

      <title>Wireless is a trap - LessWrong 2.0</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8hxvfZiqH24oqyr6y/wireless-is-a-trap</link>
      <description>I used to be an anti-wire crusader. I hated the clutter of cables, and my
tendency to unconsciously chew on them if they got anywhere near my face. But
running into bug after tricky wireless bug‚Äîmostly while trying to make my video
calls work better‚ÄîI‚Äôve apostasized. The more I‚Äôve learned about wifi, Bluetooth
and related protocols, the more I‚Äôm convinced that they‚Äôre often worse, on net,
than wires.

For instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet
service provider. That‚Äôs understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced
oligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However,
every time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their
connection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the
easiest fix has been to run a cable.

Wifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they ‚Äújust
work.‚Äù But if you investigate, you‚Äôll often find that the wireless link is
operating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent.
Since this degradation is silent, it‚Äôs often not obvious that the problem is the
wireless‚Äîinstead, you‚Äôll probably conclude that it‚Äôs your device/software/self.

Over and over again, I‚Äôve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go 
‚Äúwow, I had no idea how much better this could be!"

Fig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.
Recently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk‚Äôs wireless devices with
wired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and
break my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the
same level of tidiness, with much better reliability, quality and speed. I no
longer have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery,
or spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk. It‚Äôs
dramatically reduced my level of device-related agony.

To illustrate the degree of agony I‚Äôm</description>
