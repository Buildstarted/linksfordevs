      <title>Running a job board in Japan can land you in prison</title>
      <link>https://www.tokyodev.com/2020/11/27/legally-operating-a-job-board-in-japan/</link>
      <description>I started tokyodev as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, recruiting is a licensed industry, with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I&amp;#39;m mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we&amp;#39;ll be using the option to add
the files uncompressed. That means I don&amp;#39;t have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.</description>

      <description>As humans, we’re fundamentally “selfish”, for lack of a better term, as our own
feelings and experiences are our baseline. We’re also fundamentally empathic,
which is why most of us aren’t assholes.</description>

      <title>Digital Tools I Wish Existed</title>
      <link>https://jon.bo/posts/digital-tools/</link>
      <description>My digital life in a nutshell: I discover relevant content I don’t have time to consume, I find time and become overwhelmed with my scattered backlog, I wish the content were in a different format, and then I’m unable to find something again once I’ve consumed it. Not retaining enough is a valid problem but we’ll tackle that one later.
There’s a lot of generalization in my summary but the core issue is an extraordinarily high level of friction in the process of finding, organizing, and sharing digital content.</description>
