      <title>What Is Nix</title>
      <link>https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/what-is-nix</link>
      <description>Join us on May 25, 2020 at 1:00 pm EST for ShipIt! presents How Shopify Uses Nix, a discussion about how Shopify is using Nix to rebuild our developer tooling with Burke Libbey. Please register.
Over the past year and a bit, Shopify has been progressively rebuilding parts of our developer tooling with Nix. I initially planned to write about how we're using Nix now, and what we're going to do with it in the future (spoiler: everything?). However, I realize that most of you won't have a really clear handle on what Nix is, and I haven't found a lot of the introductory material to convey a clear impression very quickly, so this article is going to be a crash course in what Nix is, how to think about it, and why it's such a valuable and paradigm-shifting piece of technology.
There are a few places in this post where I will lie to you in subtle ways to gloss over all of the small nuances and exceptions to rules. I'm not going to call these out. I'm just trying to build a general understanding. At the end of this post, you should have the basic conceptual scaffolding you need in order to think about Nix. Let's dive in!
What is Nix?
The most basic, fundamental idea behind Nix is this:
Everything on your computer implicitly depends on a whole bunch of other things on your computer.


All software exists in a graph of dependencies.

Most of the time, this graph is implicit.

Nix makes this graph explicit.

Four Building Blocks
Let's get this out of the way up front: Nix is a hard thing to explain.
There are a few components that you have to understand in order to really get it, and all of their explanations are somewhat interdependent; and, even after explaining all of these building blocks, it still takes a bit of mulling over the implications of how they compose in order for the magic of Nix to really click. Nevertheless, we'll try, one block at a time.
The major building blocks, at least in my mental model of Nix, are:

The Nix Store
Derivations
Sandboxing
The Nix Language.

The Nix Store
The easiest place to start is the Nix Store. Once you've installed Nix, you'll wind up with a directory at /nix/store, containing a whole bunch of entries that look something like this:
3mfcmgmpcqjajpdhfh8pdazmmd4vskns-nix-2.3.3-man/h9bvv0qpiygnqykn4bf7r3xrxmvqpsrd-nix-2.3.3/nrb3rkvwz114053yh00r7p2dlc9igp03-nix-2.3.3.drv
This directory, /nix/store, is a kind of Graph Database. Each entry (each file or directory directly under /nix/store) is a Node in that Graph Database, and the relationships between them constitute Edges.
The only thing that's allowed to write directories and files into /nix/store is Nix itself, and after Nix writes a Node into this Graph Database, it's completely immutable forever after: Nix guarantees that the contents of a Node doesn't change after it's been created. Further, due to magic that we'll discuss later, the contents of a given Node is guaranteed to be functionally identical to a Node with the same name in some other Graph, regardless of where they're built.
What, then, is a </description>

      <link>https://caddy.community/t/composing-in-the-caddyfile/8291?u=matt</link>
      <description>Web server config files are mostly about expressing HTTP handling logic. Often, various handlers or middlewares need to be “composed” to form a cohesive HTTP handler that returns the desired responses.  Structurally, config files are basically limited to two dimensions: rows and columns (or, lines and tokens). Syntactically, a config file’s second dimension can expand into more dimensions or scopes when blocks are opened (which are usually represented by curly braces { } and/or indentation, simi...</description>

      <title>Accessify your Blazor apps - Hot accessibility techniques for Blazor apps</title>
      <link>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tRHPmdYDH1o</link>
      <description>Accessibility can be a jungle to navigate for regular websites and it becomes impenetrable for complex web applications. It doesn't need to be this way.

Ross will show three core techniques that move beyond the basics to really address how to start strong and begin to make your Blazor apps accessible.

Ross will explain why you should avoid the DIV button, the 'Frankenstein's monster' of non-semantic HTML which makes things that much difficult for a screen reader user. How to manage on-screen focus using Javascript Interop and show how accessibility can be maintained in large development teams by creating reusable components.

About the speaker:

Ross Mullen is Director of CANAXESS a web and digital accessibility company. He works with a range of organisations from charities and start-ups to governments making their digital services and platforms inclusive and accessible using best practice web accessibility techniques.</description>
