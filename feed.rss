      <title>REST Constraint #2: Why Client-Server Separation is a Game Changer - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-2-why-client-server-separation-is-a-game-changer/</link>
      <description>The internet as we know it thrives on separation—specifically, the separation of clients and servers. It’s a fundamental principle of REST and a key factor in building scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. But what exactly does this separation mean, and why does it matter? Let’s dive into the Client-Server constraint, one of REST’s six core architectural principles.</description>

      <title>Ruby, Ractors, and Lock-Free Data Structures</title>
      <link>https://iliabylich.github.io/ruby-ractors-and-lock-free-data-structures/</link>
      <description>This story is about concurrent data structures in the context of Ruby. The goal here is to demonstrate how true parallelism can be achieved with global mutable state (which at the time of writing, is not supported by built-in Ruby primitives).</description>

These are the Elon Musks, Jeff Bezoses, Donald Trumps, and Peter Thiels of the world. They are relentless in their pursuit of</description>

      <title>4 Learnings From Load Testing LLMs</title>
      <link>https://blog.christianposta.com/ai/learnings-from-load-testing-llms/</link>
      <description>The way LLMs run in Kubernetes is quite a bit different than running web apps or APIs. Recently I was digging into the benefits of the Inference Extensions for the Kubernetes Gateway API and I needed to generate some load for the backend LLMs I deployed (Llama, Qwen, etc). I ended up building an LLM load generation tool because I thought my use case needed some specific controls over how the test was run. In the end, I think about 90% of what I built was fairly generic for an LLM load test tool and I probably could have just tweaked the last 10% with an existing load tool to do what I needed. Nevertheless there were a few important things I learned about generating load against an LLM. Follow me (@christianposta /in/ceposta) for more thoughts on LLM perf as I will reslease some benchmarking results of running LLM inference workloads on GPUs in Kubernetes.

      <title>Pushing side projects forward with almost no free time</title>
      <link>https://rafaelcamargo.com/blog/pushing-side-projects-forward-with-almost-no-free-time/</link>
      <description>I once heard a programmer call GitHub a graveyard for side projects. Felt kinda unfair to all the folks out there grinding away, making progress day in and day out. But I get it. Getting a project off the ground takes the ability to push forward with something that never seems to fit into your free time. In this post, I share the strategy I have been using to push my side projects forward.</description>

      <title>Preparing for the Japan trip</title>
      <link>https://duggan.ie/posts/preparing-for-the-japan-trip</link>
      <description>As I wrote about in February, Ash and I are traveling to Japan for three months (May → August). It's a trip I've always wanted to take, and since I'm between work engagements I've been taking some time to prepare.    Three months is a long time to spend in a country you've never visited, and I'm going to go over a few ways we've been preparing.</description>

      <description>This post can be considered an advanced Zig tutorial. I will be covering some of the more unique
aspects of the language, but won't be explaining the easy part. If you haven't read the Zig
Language Reference, you might start there. Additionally,
we will also learn the foundational trick for implementing relational model.</description>

      <description>I tend to write a lot about my opinions about academia in my area (theoretical
computer science), e.g., about open access,
about general problems with academia, etc. If you are
interested in this topic, I just contributed an interview to the latest
Bulletin of the EATCS, the European scholarly
association for theoretical computer science (of which I am now a
vice-president).</description>

      <title>REST Constraint #1: The Power of a Uniform Interface - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-1-the-power-of-a-uniform-interface/</link>
      <description>A well-designed REST API isn’t just a random collection of endpoints—it follows a set of principles that make it predictable, scalable, and easy to use. One of the core constraints of REST is the Uniform Interface. This principle ensures that APIs are structured consistently, reducing complexity for both developers and systems interacting with them.</description>
