      <title>wtb: Progressive SPAs</title>
      <link>https://cra.mr/wtb-progressive-spas/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using React a long time at this point, and it&amp;#39;s by far my favorite approach to building a UI - interactive or not. Most of that time has been spent at Sentry, but whenever I start a new project, I still reach for React. I want to talk a little about what I&amp;#39;d love to see the React ecosystem adopt, and where I see some of the gaps with approaches today, particularly around the slow evolution of Single Page Applications.</description>

      <title>listening to your friends&amp;#39; jams with last.fm</title>
      <link>https://rjbs.cloud/blog/2024/06/lastfm-friendo/</link>
      <description>Quite a while ago, I wrote some Spotify code that would find places when my Discover Weekly playlist would intersect with those of my friends and coworkers. This was fun. Every once in a while, I talked about other things that might be fun, along those lines. I tend not to do too much with those ideas, because the Spotify API is often missing exactly the method I want, and I can work around it, but it becomes too much of a pain. Also, I’m a little lazy when the project will need other people to be interested, unless I’m sure they will be. Who wants to launch a flop to their friends?</description>

      <description>Like many in web development, Wordpress has been a semi-regular feature in my professional life and, for most of it, my impression was that it suffered from the usual infighting and mismanagement you see in free or open source software, but that it was otherwise as well run as you could expect of a long-running project built on layers and layers of legacy code.</description>

      <title>My Experience With LineageOS</title>
      <link>https://jadenarceneaux.com/posts/lineageos/</link>
      <description>Don’t take this post seriously, this is just me being goofy and having fun.
Some Background Recently, I embarked on a mini project. It started with my boss giving me her old OnePlus 8. Conveniently, the very next day the battery in my iPhone 11 Pro Max decided it wanted to see the world and pushed the screen off my phone. This meant that for the next two days, I got to become an Android user for the first time in almost 10 years.</description>

      <title>Latency, Tail Latency and Response time in distributed systems</title>
      <link>https://andrewpakhomov.com/posts/latency-tail-latency-and-response-time-in-distributed-systems/</link>
      <description>Response time is a metric that shows how fast software responds. This is the time between request was sent and the time response was received.
The questions arise right from the start: a sorting of 100 000 elements naturally requires more time than of 100.
How to measure a system response time in this case?
It’s natural to agree on some standard fixed request and perform a load test: send a lot of such standards requests
and measure response time.
The distribution of the response time we receive at the end of the performance test usually resembles a Log Normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Making Friends</title>
      <link>http://talhaashraf.com/making-friends.html</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s a pattern for people who want to make friends but are unable to. The thing they have in common is they have unusual views on a lot of mainstream things and therefore don&amp;#39;t talk about them. The problem with having unusual views is that people think you&amp;#39;re trying to be cool. But that&amp;#39;s not it. If you say that you don&amp;#39;t like rice, it&amp;#39;s because you don&amp;#39;t like them. And any food conversation would obviously have to involve this disclosure to have some context of what you do like. 

This is one of the things that makes unusual people introverts. They often fail to relate with what people are saying and therefore find it impossible to share what they themselves are thinking.

And the unusual views make it seem like you&amp;#39;re trying to look for attention. But you&amp;#39;re not. For you, the unusual view is like saying that you have tea 3 times a day. It&amp;#39;s just something basic about you.

That&amp;#39;s also why people with unusual views tend to talk less. Because the less they talk the less likely they are to say something that would make them appear unusual.

But this has a major downside. People that have unusual views are already very unlikely to find people like themselves. And when they don&amp;#39;t even talk about their unusual views, it is almost impossible to find similar people they might make great friends with.

So to make friends or to find people like yourself, you need to do the counterintuitive thing and talk about yourself. I&amp;#39;ve been unintentionally doing this for a while and I&amp;#39;ve found people like me who&amp;#39;ve read hundreds of books, who like stupid puns, who don&amp;#39;t plan on having kids, who get extremely obsessed about things.

P.S. Ironically, after writing this down, I thought about not sharing it fearing it may seem unusual because most people don&amp;#39;t have trouble making friends.</description>
