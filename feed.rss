      <description>It is often believed that learning is a simple matter of collecting answers and replies.  I suspect that “learn mechanistically how to answer the questions” is a great way for weak students to pass courses, and for smart students to ace courses. However, I believe that if you really want to learn the material, you have … Continue reading Good students find questions, not answers</description>

      <title>After-the-fact warnings</title>
      <link>https://emilymstark.com/2020/09/07/after-the-fact-warnings.html</link>
      <description>In my line of work, we talk a lot about security warning design and effectiveness. Usually, the task of a warning is to prevent a user from doing something dangerous, such as accepting an invalid certificate or installing malware. There’s another class of warnings which tell users that something bad has already happened, with the aim of helping them recover. I’ll call this category after-the-fact warnings.</description>

      <title>The Myth of Harmonious Indigenous Conservationism - Quillette</title>
      <link>https://quillette.com/2020/09/06/the-myth-of-harmonious-indigenous-conservationism/</link>
      <description>It seems like a long time ago. But only six months ago, pundits had convinced themselves that the great morality tale of our time was playing out in an obscure part of British Columbia. Following on an internal political fight within the Wet’suwet’en First Nation over a local pipeline project, one columnist wrote that “the Indigenous people of Earth have become the conscience of humanity. In this dire season, it is time to listen to them.” In fact, the elected leadership of the Wet’suwet’en had chosen to participate in the controverted pipeline project. The nationwide protests against the pipeline that followed were, in fact, sparked by unelected “hereditary” chiefs who long have received government signing bonuses. It’s unclear how this qualifies them for the exalted status of humanity’s conscience. Yet the whole weeks-long saga, which featured urban protestors appearing alongside their Indigenous counterparts at road and rail barricades throughout Canada, tapped into a strongly held noble-savage belief system within progressive circles. Various formulations of this mythology have become encoded in public land acknowledgments, college courses, …</description>

      <title>For the Future of Work, Look to Gaming</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/09/06/work.html</link>
      <description>In 2002, my mom started a new job in finance. One day, I visited her office. As part of the grand tour, she showed me her Lotus Notes setup on her PC, and explained that she received around 400 emails a day. This baffled my eleven year old mind: “why don’t you guys just use MSN?” My friends at school used Microsoft’s Messenger for everything. Some of my friends in the US had me hopping on AOL, but either one seemed obviously better than my mom and her highly-paid colleagues shooting one-line emails through their bulky setups. Nearly twenty years later, Slack and Microsoft Teams are finally making real-time chat commonplace even among the most traditional enterprises.</description>

      <title>Non-POSIX file systems - weinholt.se</title>
      <link>https://weinholt.se/articles/non-posix-filesystems/</link>
      <description>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and POSIX.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system semantics.</description>

      <title>Home - History of .NET</title>
      <link>https://historyofdot.net/</link>
      <description>Back in 2017, there was a party celebrating the 15th anniversary of .NET shipping.
                    I had the opportunity to do some short interviews with folks at the party that were part of .NET way back at the beginning.
                    You can see some of those interviews on Channel 9 at Happy Birthday .NET!
                    After the evening was over, it occured to me that we needed to write these stories down before they get lost.
                    That was the beginning of what has evolved into a multi-year effort to collect the tales that led to the creation and evolution of .NET.
                    The book has been coming for awhile now, sign up here to be kept up-to-date on its development and the many stories behind creating it!</description>
