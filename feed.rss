      <title>Refactoring optional chaining into a large codebase: lessons learned – Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/2020/06/refactoring-optional-chaining-into-a-large-codebase-lessons-learned/</link>
      <description>Now that optional chaining is supported across the board, I decided to finally refactor Mavo to use it (yes, yes, we do provide a transpiled version as well for older browsers, settle down). This is a moment I have been waiting for a long time, as I think optional chaining is the single most substantial JS syntax improvement since arrow functions and template strings. Yes, I think it’s more significant than async/await, just because of the mere frequency of code it improves. Property access is literally everywhere.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Module 1/4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Cyber-attacks have become a reality of running software on the web today. We find ourselves under a constant barrage of malicious activity from hacktivists, online criminals and increasingly, nation states. Successful attacks from these adversaries are predominantly via flaws in the software products they target – flaws that could have been prevented by developers understanding how online attackers work and what the appropriate defensive measures are.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Lightweight alternatives to Google Analytics</title>

      <description>More and more web-site owners are concerned about the "all-seeing Google"

we'll look at a few of the larger tools.</description>
