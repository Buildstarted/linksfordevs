      <title>Crate List - Blessed.rs</title>
      <link>https://blessed.rs/crates</link>
      <description>Compared to other programming languages such as Python and Go, Rust&amp;#39;s standard library is very small, including only core data structures in the standard library with all other functionality farmed out to 3rd party ecosystem crates, and a common complaint from new Rust developers is that they don&amp;#39;t know where to start: which crates they ought to use and which crates they ought to trust. This list attempts to answer those questions.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Frontend Monolith</title>
      <link>https://ng-journal.com/blog/2022-09-12-breaking-the-frontend-monolith/</link>
      <description>In this article, you will learn about the challenges that arise when migrating a typical frontend monolith to microfrontends. You will hear about common practices from Domain Driven Design, that will help you draw boundaries in your monolith, which in the end allows you to divide your subdomains into microfrontends.</description>

      <title>Molly Guard for Ansible | Paul&amp;#39;s page</title>
      <link>https://paul.totterman.name/posts/ansible-molly-guard/</link>
      <description>The Jargon File defines Molly
Guard as:

A shield to prevent tripping of some Big Red Switch by clumsy or ignorant
hands. Originally used of the plexiglass covers improvised for the BRS on an
IBM 4341 after a programmer’s toddler daughter (named Molly) frobbed it twice
in one day. Later generalized to covers over stop/reset switches on disk
drives and networking equipment. In hardware catalogues, you’ll see the much
less interesting description “guarded button”.</description>

      <title>Shells need strict typing</title>
      <link>https://aljaz.murerzen.eu/posts/2022-11-11-shells-need-typing/</link>
      <description>Command line shells are interactive programs for running other programs.
To run a program, just type its name followed by a list of arguments. This rudimentary language does not know any other types than strings, so the name of the program and all of its arguments are just strings, simply deliminator by spaces.
./build/my_program some-command --with-a-flag -m message input_file.txt Although very basic, this setup is easy to understand and create programs with, because these are just strings that can be handled in any programming or scripting language.</description>

      <description>For the last few years, I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find a topic to actually work on to develop a side project. I had quite a few ideas, but always got stuck on the &amp;quot;find people and understand their needs part&amp;quot;, because I did not know people in the domain to talk to, nor could I find those people online.
 You need a way to get people to discover you.</description>

      <title>Missing Apache Airflow, is that even possible?</title>
      <link>https://geopet85.github.io/2022/11/11/step-functions-airlow.html</link>
      <description>It’s been more than a year that I have been introduced to AWS Step Functions and my team decided to use them for our internal data workflows. It all started aiming to support all our ETL processes to extract data from our various databases, external platforms and APIs and eventually load and transform our tables using dbt into our Snowflake data warehouse. However since we also started implementing product facing features which required data transformations and exports to external systems, it made sense to extend our AWS Step Functions usage for those as well.</description>
