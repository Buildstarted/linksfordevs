      <description>Someone online was solving Advent of Code problems, and had a question about
last years‚Äô day 3. They had a working solution using regular expressions
(regexes) on String values, but they wanted to use ByteString values instead
for performance reasons. They were surprised, however, that there seems to be a
lack of community cohesion around regex libraries in Haskell.</description>

      <description>As individuals are hired into an organization, they are typically screened first and foremost for ‚Äúhard skills‚Äù. If you‚Äôre an engineer, do you know how to code, architect a system, or evaluate the tradeoffs of any particular implementation? If a financial analyst, do you know how to build a discounted cash flow model, or reconcile income statements to cash flows? Hard skills compose the tactile interface through which employees interact with technology and systems.</description>
