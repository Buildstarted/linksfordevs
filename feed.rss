      <title>Life Quests, not Goals</title>
      <link>https://himat.github.io/posts/life_quests_not_goals/</link>
      <description>Some people say they have goals that they want to accomplish in life.
I, however, have goals and quests.
I&amp;#39;ll explain what quests are, but I would recommend reevaluating your goals and considering turning some of them into quests. If you adopt this framing of quests and goals, then you might be able to better approach some of the things you want to do in life.
This quests and goals mindset is something I thought of in the past few years just because it seemed natural for me to think of things in this way.</description>

      <title>Facial recognition technology can expose political orientation from naturalistic facial images</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79310-1</link>
      <description>Ubiquitous facial recognition technology can expose individuals’ political orientation, as faces of liberals and conservatives consistently differ. A facial recognition algorithm was applied to naturalistic images of 1,085,795 individuals to predict their political orientation by comparing their similarity to faces of liberal and conservative others. Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%). Accuracy was similar across countries (the U.S., Canada, and the UK), environments (Facebook and dating websites), and when comparing faces across samples. Accuracy remained high (69%) even when controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity. Given the widespread use of facial recognition, our findings have critical implications for the protection of privacy and civil liberties.</description>

      <link>https://jimmybogard.com/taming-the-wsl-2-resource-monster/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve switched all of my Docker and *nix usage to use WSL 2 for a while now, and largely have been free of any issues/problems. That is, until recently, when I&amp;#39;ve been working on speeding up my team&amp;#39;s production Docker image builds (another story). This work heavily involved modifying</description>

      <title>Atlas: Our journey from a Python monolith to a managed platform</title>
      <link>https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/atlas--our-journey-from-a-python-monolith-to-a-managed-platform</link>
      <description>Dropbox, to our customers, needs to be a reliable and responsive service. As a company, we’ve had to scale constantly since our start, today serving more than 700M registered users in every time zone on the planet who generate at least 300,000 requests per second.
