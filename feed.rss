      <title>Focus</title>
      <link>https://vertigo.ai/focus/</link>
      <description>Vertigo.ai Focus is a new from-the-ground-up patent pending AI &amp;amp; GPU video CODEC that enables hi-def face to face interactions over low-bandwidth links. It is production-ready, extremely light-weight, and able to run in real-time on devices as old as the iPhone 6s. Focus builds on the Vertigo Engine, which demonstrates the power and versatility of our platform.
The core video CODEC works in combination with multiple neural networks that perform head and face tracking and real-time face recognition, to either filter away unrelated bystanders, or to allow everyone in view of the camera to be present in the call on equal footing.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/software-carbon-intensity/</link>
      <description>Since I’m keen on my farm, I choose a Farm Insights project where I used a Raspberry Pi and some sensors to collect very basic information about temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. I opened the project up to the Microsoft global community and ended up with folks from around the world. New Zealand, Germany, San Francisco, Georgia and of course - me here in Michigan.</description>

      <description>A lot of new tools that devs use seem to be written in Go. But why not C#? I know that C# and .Net is more than capable. Is it a lack of that kind of culture? How can we foster a more open source culture because it still seems like a lot of devs have old prejudices towards C# and .Net. I think having more interesting and useful open source tools written in C# would go a long way to change perceptions.</description>

      <description>Fuchsia is a general-purpose open-source operating system created by Google. It is based on the Zircon microkernel written in C++ and is currently under active development. The developers say that Fuchsia is designed with a focus on security, updatability, and performance.

      <title>Learnings from 5 years of tech startup code audits - Ken Kantzer&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/</link>
      <description>While I was leading PKC’s security practice, we did probably 20-30 code security audits, almost of all of them for startups that were just around their Series A or B (that was usually when they had cash and realized that it’d be good to take a deeper look at their security, after the do-or-die focus on product market fit).</description>

      <description>Linux and a Bluetooth Dongle My and my partner have started sharing our office space, and I decided to get some Airpod Pros to help reduce some of the background noise.

I figured I’d try and find a Linux friendly Bluetooth adapter to see if I could get something working.</description>

      <title>Google has been DDoSing SourceHut for over a year</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2022/05/25/Google-has-been-DDoSing-sourcehut.html</link>
      <description>Just now, I took a look at the HTTP logs on git.sr.ht. Of the past 100,000 HTTP
requests received by git.sr.ht (representing about 2&amp;#189; hours of logs), 4,774 have
been requested by GoModuleProxy — 5% of all traffic. And their requests
are not cheap: every one is a complete git clone. They come in bursts, so every
few minutes we get a big spike from Go, along with a constant murmur of Go
traffic.</description>
