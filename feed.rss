      <title>A Better Way to do Standups</title>
      <link>https://erikwinter.nl/notes/2020/a_better_way_to_do_standups/</link>
      <description>Most teams that do a version of SCRUM have a similar format for the Daily Standup Meeting. They last fifteen minutes and each team member takes a turn in explaining what he/she did yesterday and what is in store for the current day. This is not a surprising form, as it is an exact copy of how the meeting is described in the online scrum guide.</description>

      <description>After 65 years at Mad Magazine, comic artist Al Jaffee announced his retirement. Jaffee was best known for his Mad Fold-Ins, where folding the page would reveal a hidden message in the artwork. Plenty of examples can be found on the web. The problem is, they all show the before and after statically,</description>

      <title>The RuboCop Name Drama Redux</title>
      <link>https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/06/08/the-rubocop-name-drama-redux.html</link>
      <description>By now, if you‚Äôre part of the Ruby programming community, you‚Äôve probably heard of the proposal to rename RuboCop and the unpleasant events that followed it. I really struggled with coming up with a name for this article, as there are many topics I wanted to touch upon (e.g. the burden of OSS stewardship, being respectful and adhering to the norms that once defined the Ruby community, creating a safe collaborative environment, the final decision about the name, etc), but I‚Äôm quite limited in time right now. This generic title is the best that I could, but I hope you will forgive me and focus on the content instead. Once again I got reminded that naming is (very) hard. I don‚Äôt really want to go repeat/retell everything that has transpired. The GitHub issue and the surrounding Twitter conversations should give you a good idea. There‚Äôs also a nice summary, written by Tim Riley that you can peruse. The purpose of the article you‚Äôre reading now is to provide some closure for that topic and a path for us to move forward. So, here we go‚Ä¶</description>
