If you only read one section, perhaps make it "Discord staff are absolutely untrustworthy", or perhaps "Actual despicable actions and despicable people are not stopped", or you're privacy-minded, "Discord's business model".</description>

      <description>Microsoft has deemed C++ no longer acceptable for writing mission-critical software. The industry sorely needs to move to a performant, memory-safe language for its low-low system work. And the best choice on the market today is Rust, Levick said.</description>

      <description>Nix, the purely functional package manager.
 The Nix package manager has been, on and off, on my radar for a couple of years now, the premise of it, using “functional programing”-esque behaviours in order to create a reproducible package management, seemed very intriguing! I mean you know, it has to be cool because it has purely functional in its tagline! This post is a beginning of a group of posts as I experiment and play around with Nix, partially inspired (and tagged under the same name) by this ongoing playlist from Shopify’s Burke Libbey, who’s videos reignited my interest in Nix, enough to starts attempting to move to solely using it!</description>

      <title>Dependence</title>
      <link>https://smaslennikov.com/blog/2020/06/12/dependence/</link>
      <description>Today’s innovations and progress swoop humanity into a neat cycle of anticipation and acquisition through deceptive notions that guide it to dependence. We’re sold on products and ideas through questionable but politically acceptable marketing tactics. We buy, pre-order, take out loans, only to supposedly upgrade later to a somehow inferior product.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Bimachines</title>
      <link>https://deniskyashif.com/2020/06/12/introduction-to-bimachines/</link>
      <description>Bimachines are deterministic finite-state devices that represent the class regular string functions and are commonly used for text rewriting. What is fascinating about them is that they process the input text in both directions - from left to right and from right to left which makes them very efficient in practice as they guarantee linear time input processing.</description>
