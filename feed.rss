      <title>Cosmopolitan C Library</title>
      <link>https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html</link>
      <description>Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn&amp;#39;t require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn&amp;#39;t invent a new
  language and you won&amp;#39;t need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.</description>

      <title>How Complex Systems Fail</title>
      <link>https://how.complexsystems.fail/</link>
      <description>All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power
          generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own
          nature. The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but
          the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and
          irreducibly hazardous. It is the presence of these hazards that drives
          the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these
          systems.</description>

      <title>The Pope’s  Latin teacher - The Oldie</title>
      <link>https://theoldie.co.uk/blog/the-popes-latin-teacher</link>
      <description>​Reginald Foster was the Pope’s Latinist for 40 years –and for four Popes – from 1969 to 2009. The discalced (from a barefoot or sandal-wearing order) Carmelite priest and friar turns 80 on 14th November.

To become the Pope’s Latinist was some appointment for the plumber’s son from the American Midwest. Father Reginald, known as Reggie, was always a bright one. Whenever he did well at school, his mother used to shout, ‘I knew it! I brought the wrong baby home from the hospital!’</description>
