      <title>Watch out for .NET Core Runtime Bitness for IIS Installs</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/25/Watch-out-for-NET-Core-Runtime-Bitness-for-IIS-Installs</link>
      <description>I recently ran into a snag with one of the my Windows Server installs of an upgraded .NET Core 5.0 application. It turns out I didn&amp;#39;t install .NET Core 5.0 correctly because I made some bad assumptions of what I needed to install to run my application, even though it previously ran on .NET Core 3.1. Here&amp;#39;s more detail on what the failure looks like and how to properly install .NET Core 5.0. </description>

      <title>Caching - Simply Explained</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyXURRVmR0</link>
      <description>What is a cache? How does it work, and why is it important?

Caches are used everywhere in our modern devices. It&amp;#39;s found in many hardware components and throughout software. The goal of caching is to store data from slow memory into fast memory so it can be retrieved quicker.

That&amp;#39;s why browsers keep a cache: so they don&amp;#39;t have to re-download everything from the internet over and over again.

      <title>Reliably Save State &amp;amp; Publish Events (Outbox Pattern)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8fOnxAxKHk</link>
      <description>What&amp;#39;s the Outbox Pattern? A reliable way of saving state to your database and publishing a message/event to a message broker.

Why do you need it? When you get into messaging, you will often find code that needs to save state to your database, and then publish an message/event to a message broker.  Unfortunately because they are two different resources, you need a distributed transaction to make these atomic.  There is another option to use the Outbox Pattern which does not require a distributed transaction and most messaging libraries support it.

      <title>Upgrading to .NET Core 5.0</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Nov/24/Upgrading-to-NET-Core-50</link>
      <description>Over the last week I spent some time upgrading several .NET Core Web applications and libraries from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 5.0. I&amp;#39;m happy to say that this was always a non-event as the process went very smooth for once. In this post I&amp;#39;ll talk about what I found and also offer some commentary why we should celebrate this update and push Microsoft to continue along this path.</description>

      <description>Dustin and Mads take you on a tour of the new features in C# 9.0: Top-level programs remove clutter. Init-only properties and records improve support for immutable and value-based programming. New patterns take pattern matching to the next level.

      <title>Comparison of Email Hosting Possibilities</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/comparison-of-email-hosting-possibilities/</link>
      <description>I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve hosted my own Mailserver in various configurations since more than 6 years now. Since then I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve taken multiple breaks from hosting it myself and explored other solutions for hosting emails with your own domain names.
