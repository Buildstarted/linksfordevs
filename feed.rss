      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/azure-sql-triggers-for-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This post is about Azure SQL trigger for Azure Functions. The Azure SQL trigger uses SQL change tracking functionality to monitor a SQL table for changes and trigger a function when a row is created, updated, or deleted. Changes are processed in the order that their changes were made, with the oldest changes being processed first. Currently SQL trigger is not available as part of Visual Studio new function screen. We need to create an Azure function and modify code to support Sql triggers.</description>

      <title>Using F* to Formally Verify Programs</title>
      <link>https://maxtaylor.dev/posts/2023/05/fstar-leetcode</link>
      <description>Formal methods are currently not widely embraced due to theirperceived difficulty. However, the landscape is changing with theemergence of new technologies that make formal methods more accessiblethan ever before. F*, developed by Microsoft Research, is agroundbreaking functional language that combines dependent types andproof-oriented features. By bridging the gap between programming andproving, F* facilitates a gradual adoption of formal methods bysoftware engineers. In this post, I will provide an introduction to thebasics of F* and demonstrate how we can leverage itscapabilities to verify a solution to a LeetCode problem. I can’t coverall the background material needed to understand F* in this post. Iassume that you have some experience in a language like Haskell orOCaml.</description>

      <title>Finding your weak spots</title>
      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/weak-spots/</link>
      <description>In 2018, I was coasting. I didn’t like it.
Life was good, I was steadily employed as a senior developer. We had a good team. We were building valuable software for our customers. Everything seemed great.
But I’d been coasting for a few years. I believed I could coast for a few years more (I was wrong) but I was uncomfortable. I needed to fix it.
I went through books, articles, podcasts and more books.</description>

      <title>You Are Already There</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/you-are-already-there/</link>
      <description>I’ve been fighting my whole life. I always wanted to move forward, to get somewhere.
Once I pass that exam, everything will be ok.
Once I get my degree, I’ll be fulfilled and happy.
Once I get enough money, my life will be great.
I was always looking forward to the next stage, always wanting something more. Like if all my problems would fade away as soon as I achieved something.</description>
