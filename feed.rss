Why is it important?

      <description>A subtle source of errors and less-than-subtle source of frustration is understanding and using service lifetimes appropriately with .NET Core dependency injection. Service lifetimes, while complicated on the surface, can help developers that need to share state across different lifetimes of an application. Typically, a long-running application has three service</description>

      <title>Autoscrolling on drag, part 4: Dynamic autoscroll based on escape velocity | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210128-00/?p=104768</link>
      <description>Last time, we noted some problems with autoscroll based on the distance from the mouse to the window. An alternate design is to use the speed with which the mouse exited the window to establish the autoscroll speed. This no longer penalizes people with small screens or windows near the edge of the screen.</description>

      <description>If you’re coming from VB6 / Winforms world, one of the challenge in ASP.NET Core is lack of reporting tools. In VB6, Crystal reports was there. And if I am not wrong it was part of some Visual Studio versions. I was exploring a free reporting tool for one of old companies as they were planning to move their VB6 app to ASP.NET Core and Cloud. So lets explore Fast Report Open Source.</description>

      <title>A Quest to Find a Highly Compressed Emoji :shortcode: Lookup Function</title>
      <link>https://prilik.com/blog/post/emoji-shortcodes/</link>
      <description>Have you ever wondered what&amp;amp;rsquo;s the smallest amount of static storage (code + data) needed to map emoji :shortcodes: to emoji?
Probably not&amp;amp;hellip; but now that I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve posed the question, aren&amp;amp;rsquo;t you at least a little curious what the answer might be?
So hey, if you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve got some time to spare, why not stick around a while and learn a bit about cool topics such as perfect hashing, probabilistic data structures, and 2D dynamic programming algorithms?
Take a break from solving whatever &amp;amp;ldquo;important problem&amp;amp;rdquo; you&amp;amp;rsquo;re working on, kick back, relax, and join me on my [somewhat useless] quest to find a highly compressed emoji :shortcode: lookup function!
 Thanks to the power of WebAssembly, you can play with the final result right from your browser!
&amp;amp;mdash;-&amp;amp;gt; Check out the online demo! &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;mdash;&amp;amp;ndash;

      <title>OO in Python is mostly pointless</title>
      <link>https://leontrolski.github.io/mostly-pointless.html</link>
      <description>People bash OO a lot these days, I&amp;#39;m increasingly coming to the opinion they&amp;#39;re right, at least in Python. My point here is not to argue that OO is bad per se, more that its introduction is simply unnecessary, AKA not useful.</description>

      <title>Tip 303 - How to use GitHub Actions from Azure App Service</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip303.html</link>
      <description>When you need to manually build and deploy your app, each time that you make a change, you will make mistakes, which result in bugs and downtime for users. Automating your build and deployment processes makes them less error-prone and allows you to deploy as often as you want. GitHub Actions (opens new window) can help to automate your builds and deployments and integrates with Azure App Service (opens new window).</description>

      <link>https://2ality.com/2021/01/undefined-null-revisited.html</link>
      <description>Many programming languages have one “non-value” called null. It indicates that a variable does not currently point to an object – for example, when it hasn’t been initialized yet.</description>
