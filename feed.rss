      <title>A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport</title>
      <link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html</link>
      <description>This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC provides
applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication,
low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration. QUIC includes
security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a
range of deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the
integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary
congestion control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Using Phoenix Without Webpack</title>
      <link>https://jsonmaur.com/using-phoenix-without-webpack/</link>
      <description>Gravitating away from Javascript over the years, I’ve been exposed to many different programming paradigms and languages. One in particular is functional programming with Elixir, and building web apps with the Phoenix framework. Not only is Elixir a clean and well-designed language, Phoenix takes an HTML-over-the-wire approach similar to traditional frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails, which I prefer over the client-side SPA/server-side API approach. Phoenix also has an amazing community behind it and doesn’t make you feel like pulling your hair out at 3am over cryptic build issues (unlike a popular JS framework that shall remain nameless).</description>

      <link>https://texasexpat.net/2021/05/12-startups-in-12-months</link>
      <description>Way back in the halcyon days of September 2010, I threw my hat in the ring for the first Ludum Dare October Challenge, where a bunch of hobbyist gamedevs built indie games in public, for a month, with the end
 goal of getting them out for sale before the end of October. The idea was to turn a bunch of hobbyists (i.e., us) into professionals (i.e., what we wanted to be) -- and if the definition of a &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;someone who gets paid for their work&amp;quot;, well, 
all we had to do was make a game, release it, and earn at least $1 from it.</description>

      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/david-ortinau-on-multi-platform-app-development-using-net-maui-episode-142</link>
      <description>In this episode, Jeffrey Palermo is speaking with David Ortinau. David is a Principal Program Manager for the .NET Client Apps team at Microsoft, whose team’s primary focus is on Xamarin forms and .NET MAUI.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; David has been a .NET developer since 2002 and is versed in a range of programming languages. After several successes with tech startups and running his own software company, he joined Microsoft to follow his passion for crafting tools that help developers create better app experiences. When he’s not at a computer or with his family, he’s running trails through the woods. &amp;amp;nbsp; David takes listeners through the ins and outs of multi-platform app development using .NET MAUI in today’s episode. He shares what developers can look forward to come the November release and provides a full rundown of what it looks like to use .NET MAUI from wrapping the local environment and building to testing to packaging and deploying. Don’t miss out on learning about what makes .NET MAUI a powerful tool you should be on the lookout for! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:14] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups.

[19:30] For those who haven’t done any Xamarin forms at all, is the message with .NET MAUI that your C# code goes to Android, IoS, Mac, etc? Or is it more nuanced than that? [21:10] If someone wanted to try out MAUI today, would David recommend that someone try out the preview today or wait for a future preview? [24:12] David gives a full rundown of what the process looks like to use .NET MAUI. (how to wrap the local environment, build, test, deploy, etc.), starting off with what developers need to have locally on their computers to get started.

[32:40] David speaks about the .NET MAUI chain for packaging and deploying to devices and keeping track of builds that may be deployed.

      <description>Today we’re excited to announce the availability of TypeScript 4.3!
