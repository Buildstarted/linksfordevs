      <description>ASP.NET’s Minimal APIs are low-ceremony and require minimal lines of code to implement functional web APIs, but minimal APIs often require grand implementations. Join ASP.NET developers are they walk you behind the scenes of a minimal application, highlighting the implementation and design details needed to ship easy-to-use and approachable APIs for building web apps.&amp;#160; Breakout: BRK206H | English (US) This session was delivered as part of the Microsoft Ignite 2022 event.

      <title>A deep dive into endpoint filters in ASP.NET Core 7</title>
      <link>https://blog.safia.rocks/endpoint-filters-exploration.html</link>
      <description>One of the features that I worked on as part of the ASP.NET Core 7 release was support for endpoint filters in minimal APIs. I recently shared some of the internals of the implementation at a recent Ignite presentation, but I figured I would share the insights in a blog as well. If you’re more of a visual or audio learner, you might find the video presentation helpful.</description>

Let’s talk about why your app isn’t scaling, what you need to know about modern .NET apps, great patterns, app development in the cloud and much more. We will also ask the question “what’s the smallest .NET app possible?” and try to answer it live on stage.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Breakout: BRK203H | English (US) This session was delivered as part of the Microsoft Ignite 2022 event.

      <title>Killing one bird with two-and-a-half stones in Mac OS X Mail - Tech Reflect</title>
      <link>https://techreflect.net/2022/10/killing-one-bird-with-two-and-a-half-stones-in-mac-os-x-mail/</link>
      <description>This story is important to me because it was the first software I ever wrote that shipped to more than just a few friends or colleagues. What started as some scripting turned into Cocoa development, which is not something I ever expected to find myself doing. It never became a full-time thing for me, but it was a fun journey. Note: I joined the Mail team in June 2000, three months before the Public Beta. We shipped the first “real” version of Mac OS X (10.0) nine months later. On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).&amp;#160;The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers.&amp;#160;While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac... Read More Read More</description>

      <title>Python isn’t Used in Prod</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/10/19/python-isnt-used-in-prod/</link>
      <description>I watched a video earlier this week by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. It’s an entertaining walkthrough of some impressive optimisation of his own Python code by his community but there’s a comment about Python that I thought warranted some pushback.
That comment was that ‘Python will very rarely make it into production’. The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work.</description>
