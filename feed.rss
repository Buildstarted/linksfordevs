      <title>DRM-Free e-Books Are Now Available. Here’s Why That’s a Big Deal</title>
      <link>https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/drm-free-e-books-are-now-available-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal</link>
      <description>Since e-books first emerged as a way for readers to consume content digitally, publishers and authors have required content aggregators to apply Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to the e-books they sell to libraries to prevent the unauthorized use, copying, and redistribution of these materials. While this practice has given publishers and authors peace of mind that sales won’t be lost to piracy or other unauthorized sharing, it has placed undue restrictions on readers who rely on institutional access to e-books.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! bUnit Update with Egil Hansen</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1868</link>
      <description>What&amp;#39;s the latest with bUnit? Carl and Richard chat with Egil Hansen about his excellent testing library for Blazor. Egil digs into the ongoing improvements being made in Blazor and how bUnit can support those changes without having to rewrite tests - even .NET 8 shouldn&amp;#39;t be a huge problem! The conversation also digs into the different sorts of open-source projects out there, including tooling like bUnit. Not all open source is created the same! Great thinking from an experienced builder of testing tools to make it easier to build reliable Blazor applications.</description>

      <title>Debunking the Chessboard: Confronting GPTs Against Chess Engines to Estimate Elo Ratings and Assess Legal Move Abilities</title>
      <link>https://blog.mathieuacher.com/GPTsChessEloRatingLegalMoves/</link>
      <description>Can GPTs like ChatGPT-4 play legal moves and finish chess games? What is the actual Elo rating of GPTs? There have been some hypes, (subjective) assessment, and buzz lately from “GPT is capable of beating 99% of players?” to “GPT plays lots of illegal moves” to “here is a magic prompt with Magnus Carlsen in the headers”. There are more or less solid anecdotes here and there, with counter-examples showing impressive failures or magnified stories on how GPTs can play chess well. I’ve resisted for a long time, but I’ve decided to do it seriously! I have synthesized hundreds of games with different variants of GPT, different prompt strategies, against different chess engines (with various skills). This post is here to document the variability space of experiments I have explored so far… and the underlying insights and results. 

The tldr; is that gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct operates around 1750 Elo and is capable of playing end-to-end legal moves, even with black pieces or when the game starts with strange openings. 
However, though there are “avoidable” errors, the issue of generating illegal moves is still present in 16% of the games. Furthermore, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo and more surprisingly ChatGPT-4, however, are much more brittle. Hence, we provide first solid evidence that training for chat makes GPT worse on a well-defined problem (chess). Please do not stop to the tldr; and read the entire blog posts: there are subtleties and findings worth discussing!

It corresponds roughly to a steady rate of improvement of 34% per year on the number of transistors, or a doubling every 2.5 years.

      <title>Strange Safari bug involving cursor position leak between windows – Gabriel Sieben</title>
      <link>https://gabrielsieben.tech/2023/10/17/strange-safari-bug-involving-cursor-position/</link>
      <description>Recently, I’ve built a navigation sidebar with Tailwind that changes appearance based on a CSS hover, and I’ve found a strange bug. I’ve found Safari will, under the right conditions, leak the cursor position during a click to completely different windows, underneath the window being clicked on.</description>

      <title>Galactic Civilizations: Does N=1? | Centauri Dreams</title>
      <link>https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2023/10/18/galactic-civilizations-does-n1/</link>
      <description>I don’t suppose that Frank Drake intended his famous Drake Equation to be anything more than a pedagogical device, or rather, an illustrative tool to explain what he viewed as the most significant things we would need to know to figure out how many other civilizations might be out there in the galaxy. This was back in 1961, and naturally the equation was all about probabilities, because we didn’t have hard information on most of the factors in the equation. Drake was already searching for radio signals at Green Bank, in the process inventing SETI as practiced through radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Thousands of elderly twins assure me that my kids will be alright | Robert Heaton</title>
      <link>https://robertheaton.com/twins/</link>
      <description>I know that time spent with my kids is supposed to be its own reward, and it is. But I also want to believe that what I do in this time matters, as much as possible. Elegantly handling a tantrum feels more worthwhile if I’m helping my son learn to express his feelings, not just making it through another day. I find more contentment at the end of a long afternoon if I think that I did a good job and that this good job will echo through the ages,...</description>

      <description>The typographic scale has been used for centuries to choose harmonious font sizes. It has been likened to a harmonious musical scale. But there are *flaws* in those historical values.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with the Community Notes feature on Twitter. It&amp;#39;s an interesting solution to moderation at scale that relies on humans. For my money (and, I guess, time) it&amp;#39;s the most interesting thing going on the platform right now.</description>

      <title>Braedon McDonald</title>
      <link>https://braedonmcdonald.ca/posts/binary-adder.html</link>
      <description>My niece has a toy that I constantly find myself playing with when I visit. It&amp;#39;s a simple wooden box with some switches and LEDs on the front. Electronics wise, the switches are just wired to toggle certain LEDs but it&amp;#39;s very fun to fiddle with and I find the overall design with the wooden enclosure very satisfying. For a long time I thought it would be cool to make something with a similar wooden enclosure that does something a bit more involved. This fall, I finally got around to following through with this idea and made something in the same spirit as my nieces toy except the LEDs and switches are connected to a binary adder.</description>
