      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/infuse-machine-learning-into-your-aspnetcore-apps/</link>
      <description>This article is about infusing machine learning into your ASP.NET Core applications with ML.NET. ML.NET is a free, open source, and cross platform machine learning framework for the .NET developer platform. In this example, I am using ML.NET Model Builder with the help of Visual Studio. Few months back I wrote an article about Building mailinator clone using SendGrid and ASP.NET Core. In this example, I am integrating machine learning identify incoming emails are Spam or Not Spam.</description>

      <title>C# Pattern Matching Quick Guide And Examples</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/csharp-pattern-matching-quick-guide-and-examples</link>
      <description>With each new release of C#, pattern matching improves for C# developers. While developers do not widely use pattern matching today, we’ll likely see its adoption grow as more teams and applications move from the Full Framework (.NET 4.8) to the runtime’s newer variants (.NET 5+). Like most unique features to the language, there’s always an initial knee-jerk reaction to either embrace it, use it everywhere, or outright hate it. Regardless of what camp we fall under, we must understand some everyday use cases in the chance we want to work with C# pattern matching.</description>

      <title>Locked Files When Publishing .NET Core Apps to IIS with WebDeploy</title>

      <description>When using Visual Studio&amp;#39;s Publish Web Site feature with ASP.NET Core you may get frustrating errors when publishing to already running sites as files on the server are locked and can&amp;#39;t be updated until the site is shutdown. Turns out the default settings don&amp;#39;t unload the application before publising, but there&amp;#39;s a simple solution to unload before publishing and the restart the application.</description>

      <description>Note: this is based on craver/exception-cleanup due to how Tim had branches - we&amp;amp;#39;ll switch to being against main once #1761 is in.
