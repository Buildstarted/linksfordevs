      <title>I miss working from the office</title>
      <link>https://www.roguelazer.com/2020/11/i-miss-working-from-the-office/</link>
      <description>I went into my office yesterday for the first time in a few months to pick some stuff up. We got notified a couple of days ago to get any personal property out of the office before Thanksgiving or else it&amp;#39;d be thrown out, so I guess we&amp;#39;re moving out of the office1. It was a pretty eerie place to be; even now, 8 months later, most people haven&amp;#39;t been back and it kind of looks like the entire office was abducted by aliens in early March. Despite how weird it is, I still miss working out of the office.</description>

      <description>A new study indicates that hyperbaric oxygen treatments (HBOT) in healthy aging adults can stop the aging of blood cells and reverse the aging process. In the biological sense, the adults&amp;#39; blood cells actually grow younger as the treatments progress.</description>

      <title>Why Japanese Web Design Is So Different – Cultural, Linguistic &amp;amp; Technical Factors – Randomwire</title>
      <link>https://randomwire.com/why-japanese-web-design-is-so-different/</link>
      <description>In the mind’s eye of many people, Japan is a land of tranquil Zen gardens, serene temples, and exquisite tea ceremonies. Both traditional and contemporary Japanese architecture, books and magazines are the envy of designers worldwide. Yet for some reason practically none of this mastery has been translated into digital products, in particular websites, most of which look like they hail from around 1998.</description>
