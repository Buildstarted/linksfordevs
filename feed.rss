      <title>Can You Grok It :: dade</title>
      <link>https://0xda.de/blog/2024/04/can-you-grok-it/</link>
      <description>My friend sent me a tunnel link where he had to manually set it up with socat and his nginx ingress controller in his k8s cluster. He made an offhand comment about needing a better way to setup tunnels and it got me thinking. This post is the result of a long night of hacking away at my own tunnel solution.
If you want to jump into the nitty gritty of how it works, you can skip to Roll Your Own Tunnel.</description>

      <title>Revealed: The software scalability game | Samuel Lissner</title>
      <link>https://slissner.com/posts/the-software-scalability-game/</link>
      <description>Software scalability isn&amp;#39;t just a fancy engineering exercise. It&amp;#39;s a game where businesses need to level up. And if you can’t figure out how to play the game, you’ll probably never succeed to move your architecture to the next level.</description>

      <title>Implementing an SHA transformer by hand</title>
      <link>https://andrew.gr/stories/sha/</link>
      <description>So the first question, you, and any reasonable person, may have when
seeing this post title is &amp;quot;why?? why would you ever do this?&amp;quot; Well, I
have a pretty good reason—Andis and I came up with a scheme to insert
undetectable backdoors into transformers, but it depends on
having a &amp;quot;submodule&amp;quot; which can compute a pretty strong hash. SHA-2 is a great
candidate for this—not least because its Wikipedia article actually has
pseudocode for its implementation—so now all we have to do is make a
transformer which, given some input, places that input&amp;#39;s hash into the
residual stream.</description>

      <title>My Cat Alerted Me to a DDoS Attack</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-cat-alerted-me-to-a-ddos-attack</link>
      <description>A few years ago, my cat gave me my most memorable middle of the night software
engineering incident. I was working at a startup, and we didn’t have a formal
on-call rotation yet. That was a deliberate decision, since being on-call is
painful, and the team was good about just collectively keeping an eye out for
urgent alerts. We eventually set up an on-call rotation, but before that
happened, I had a fun night.</description>
