      <title>How Much of the Hitchhiker&amp;#39;s Guide to the Galaxy Can You Fit on a QR Code?</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/qr-code-hitchhikers-guide/</link>
      <description>I’ve been dealing with QR codes recently, as one of my side projects generates them, and I got curious about how much data you can really fit in a QR code. Specifically, I wondered how much of my favorite book I could fit on one QR code.
QR Code versions QR Codes have different versions, but they’re not versions as you’d generally think about them, version in this case just means a particular size.</description>

      <title>Piano Practice Software Progress &amp;#183; Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/piano-practice-software-progress/</link>
      <description>First an apology. I started this project because during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic business was down to a fraction of what it was before then, and I had a lot of time on my hand. But that has changed now and there is a lot of work in my ‘day job’, so I don’t have a whole lot of time to work on the piano software (or to play piano, for that matter). Even so I try to play at least an hour every day, just to unwind from the work, and while doing that I make notes of the things that I think should be improved.</description>

      <title>Writing Documentation</title>
      <link>https://tiriplicamihai.github.io/2021/03/27/writing-documentation.html</link>
      <description>Writing documentation is the kryptonite for software engineers. It’s this thing we have to do after we finish all the interesting work and since we did all the interesting work we know everything about it so why do we need to document it? This idea it’s definitely exaggerated but I did have a version of these feelings in my first years as a software engineer. And this is ironic because during that time the top learning place for me was actually documentation (I remember always having a tab open with the Django documentation site). There was difference though - it was good written documentation that was helping me while I was writing and dreading the bad kind.</description>
