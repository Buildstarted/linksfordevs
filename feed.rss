      <title>Precision Munitions for Denial of Service</title>
      <link>https://beny23.github.io/posts/precision_munitions_for_denial_of_service/</link>
      <description>There’s a metaphor about the fight between attackers and defenders in the Denial of Service cybersecurity game. It’s an “arms race” between ever bigger attacks throwing huge amounts of traffic at ever more sophisticated defenses (e.g. AWS shield).
Incidentally, I’ve just demonstrated an easy mistake: I’m not describing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, it’s a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The aim is to overwhelm the infrastructure, either the networking infrastructure or the application by sending more requests than can be handled.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Queries in MySQL: Optimizing Reads - Simple Talk</title>
      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/mysql/optimizing-queries-in-mysql-optimizing-reads/</link>
      <description>Optimizing read operations is one of the most prominent problems concerning any database administrator. No matter what kind of database management system is in use – MySQL, its flavors like Percona Server or MariaDB, MongoDB, TimescaleDB, SQL Server, or others, read queries are a concern. The primary read query example is SELECT queries, but a lot of this pertains to UPDATE and DELETE as well since they too have to fetch rows to be operated on.</description>

      <title>Preparing Fastify for Testing</title>
      <link>https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2023/jan/31/fastify-testing/</link>
      <description>One of the most popular training programs for our customers at NodeSource is the Testing Workshop, which includes a general introduction to testing but quickly dives into hands-on Fastify examples and CI/CD with GitHub Workflows. I thought I&amp;#39;d take a few essential Fastify bits from this training and have it in a blog post, for quick future reference.</description>

      <title>Using platforms encourages internet censorship</title>

      <description>Since politicians figured out how disruptive the internet in politics and how people outside of established power structures (outside government and media circles) can swing public opinion. There have been increasing attempts by governments worldwide to regulate (read as censor) it.</description>

      <title>tools for finding information on the internet</title>
      <link>https://roman.computer/finding_information/</link>
      <description>Isn’t the internet such a magically useful tool? Thirty years ago, if you wanted to know how many plays Shakespeare wrote, you would have to physically walk to your local library and find a relevant book. Now, you can find the answer in less than ten seconds, at any time, wherever you are.
However, the internet is not a truthful, superintelligent oracle. Rather, it’s a dangerous jungle of knowledge you must learn to navigate if you wish to find the truth.</description>

      <title>My first recession</title>
      <link>https://gadi.fm/posts/recession/</link>
      <description>There’s an entire generation going through a recession for the first time.
Sure, everyone says we need to adapt, and while true, I think the phenomenon in itself – going through a recession for the first time – is a key paradigm shift for all of us first-timers. I’ll try capturing some of it here through my personal experience.
I was a one-year-old when the Dotcom bubble burst, and I was 9 when the Great Recession started.</description>

      <description>I’ve been a fan of static site generation for a while. When I switch over to GitHub Pages in 2012, I used Jekyll because it was the default option. It’s still great! But there are some rough edges that bug me.</description>
