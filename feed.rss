We'll explore what neurons are doing individually and as a group to "understand" perceptions. It leads us to the Manifold Hypothesis.

      <description>One day Alan Eliasen read a fart joke and got so mad he invented a programming language. 20 years later Frink is one of the best special purpose languages for dealing with units.
‚ÄúBut why do we need a language just for dealing with units?‚Äù Glad you asked!
Intro to Units A unit is the physical property a number represents, like distance or time. We almost always are talking about SI units, or Syst√®me international.</description>

      <title>The Value of Alternative Investments ¬∑ Sturm Mabie</title>
      <link>https://cryptm.org/posts/2020/07/09/alt.html</link>
      <description>A retail investor would be forgiven for assuming that there are really
only two assets classes one should consider for personal investments:
equities (stocks) and fixed income (bonds). Wherever you look, these two
asset classes dominate the financial landscape. All robo-advisors and
most personal advisors implement a mix of bonds and equities for the
portfolio's of their clients. The idea behind this mix is simple: bonds
are low risk and will earn you a marginal return, while equities are
riskier and will be the real engine of returns in good times. In bad
times, bonds will rise, mitigating some of the losses of your equity
portfolio: it's been long known and accepted that stocks and bonds have
a negative correlation. Tying this strategy together is periodic
rebalancing, taking money off the table during bull markets (and moving
them to the safer bonds), and deploying money to the equity portion
during bear markets. This in effect overlays a mean-reversion strategy
onto the portfolio, boosting the returns of an otherwise static
portfolio. The archetypal allocation is 60% equities, and 40% bonds,
though each investor's allocation is going to differ based on his risk
tolerance, age, and personal goals.</description>
