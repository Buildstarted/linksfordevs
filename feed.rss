      <title>How to Disable GitHub Actions in a Forked Project</title>
      <link>https://seankilleen.com/2021/11/how-to-disable-github-actions-in-a-forked-project/</link>
      <description>Some GitHub repositories have GitHub Actions with helpful automation. Because actions are stored in the .github folder within a codebase, they come over along with any forks that are created. In many cases, this could be really helpful, as you get a great level of automation out of the box.</description>

      <title>Access data with managed identity - Azure App Service</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/access-data-with-managed-identity-azure-app-service/</link>
      <description>This post is about connecting and accessing data from SQL Service using Azure App Service Managed Identity feature. Azure SQL supports Azure AD authentication, which means it also supports the Managed Identity feature of Azure AD. With Managed Identity, we no longer need the User Id and Password as part of your connection string. The credential is managed automatically by Azure and allows us to connect to resources.</description>

      <title>Introducing River, a Dynamic Tiling Wayland Compositor</title>
      <link>https://isaacfreund.com/blog/river-intro/</link>
      <description>In the spring of 2020 I found myself hooked on Wayland thanks to
sway but increasingly frustrated with the
i3 style window management sway implements.
I tried several of the other more mature Wayland compositors
including hikari and
Wayfire but didn’t enjoy them any more
than sway. I wanted dynamic tiling window management similar to
dwm but on Wayland and without dwm’s configuration
through patching the source code approach.</description>

      <title>NSwag generated C# client: Open API property name clashes and decimal types rather than double | I CAN MAKE THIS WORK</title>
      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/10/31/nswag-generated-c-sharp-client-property-name-clash/</link>

This post demonstrates how to get over both issues.</description>
