      <title>Discord Should Remove Usernames Entirely</title>
      <link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/discord-should-remove-usernames/</link>
      <description>Discord&amp;#39;s Recent Announcement made a lot of people mad, mostly because of Hyrum&amp;#39;s Law - users were relying on unintended observable behavior in the original username system, and are mad that their use-cases are being broken despite very good evidence that the current system is problematic. I think the major issue here is that Discord didn&amp;#39;t go far enough, and as a result, it&amp;#39;s confusing users who are unaware of the technical and practical reasons for the username change, or what a username is even for.</description>

      <title>How to create resilient digital products.</title>
      <link>https://christianscott.io/blog/resilient-systems/</link>
      <description>Any founder with a product in production knows the pain of waking up at 0200 to outage alerts, or support interruptions at family dinner. It can be rough and scaling support is challenging. Here are some things you can do to make your systems more resilient.
Remove complexity. Simple systems are just easier to maintain. They fail less often, and in less interesting ways. Interesting failures are time-consuming, expensive, and annoying to deal with.</description>

      <title>Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes</title>
      <link>https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-grpc-liveness-probe</link>
      <description>This page shows how to configure liveness, readiness and startup probes for containers.
The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.
A common pattern for liveness probes is to use the same low-cost HTTP endpoint as for readiness probes, but with a higher failureThreshold.</description>

      <title>E7: Thoughts on &amp;quot;Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%&amp;quot;</title>
      <link>https://www.infrastructureposts.com/p/e7-thoughts-on-scaling-up-the-prime</link>
      <description>I came across this article the other day when it was all over reddit. I couldn’t help but notice that a lot of people seem to take this as “we should stop doing microservices all together and go back to building monoliths” and I want to elaborate on why I don’t think that was the point of the article at all and what we should take away instead.</description>
