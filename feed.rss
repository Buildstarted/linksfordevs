      <title>Lean Claude Code for Production | Nizar's Blog</title>
      <link>https://nizar.se/lean-claude-code-for-production/</link>
      <description>Many agentic coding demos showcase landing pages, one-off scripts, or greenfield projects. While technically impressive, they often produce single files with little thought for maintainability. Even OpenAI's ChatGPT 5 launch demo followed this pattern. At the other extreme, some content focuses almost entirely on elaborate integrations and orchestrations.</description>

      <title>Interviewing your laptop - Biased and Inefficient</title>
      <link>https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2025/08/15/interviewing-your-laptop/</link>
      <description>There’s increasing interest in (or, at least, coverage of) the idea that surveying large language models could substitute for surveying people. This has obvious advantages: to repurpose a Heinlein quote “it’s cheap, clean, convenient, and free of any possibility of wrongdoing–and you don’t have to go home in the cold”. The problem is I can’t see how it could possibly work.</description>

      <description>HS2 has become a case study in how not to build infrastructure. But what if we’d taken a different path entirely?  In this post, I imagine how the Swiss would have done it:  starting with the timetable, not the project. It’s a counterfactual, but it’s not a fantasy.</description>

      <description>Lately, I have been pondering the waste we generate as we live and the ways to reduce it. As I scale down, I fill trash bags with things I can’t use, which bothers me. The items that can be donated and have a second life are strictly excluded from this definition, though. They’re donated to people who need them.</description>

      <title>» Bullfrog in the Dungeon The Digital Antiquarian</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2025/08/bullfrog-in-the-dungeon/</link>
      <description>In January of 1995, Electronic Arts bought the prestigious British games studio Bullfrog Productions for an undisclosed sum that was rumored to be in the neighborhood of $45 million. The lives of the 35 or so people who worked at Bullfrog were transformed overnight. Peter Molyneux, the man who had build the studio’s reputation on the back of his “god game” Populous six years earlier, woke up the morning after the contract was signed with real money to spend for the first time in his life. For him and his colleagues, the new situation was gratifying, but also vaguely unsettling.</description>

      <title>We Rewrote the Ghostty GTK Application</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-gtk-rewrite</link>
      <description>We just completed
rewriting the Ghostty GTK application fully embracing the
GObject type system from Zig
and also verifying with Valgrind every step of the way.
The result is a more feature rich, stable, and maintainable Ghostty
on Linux and BSD.</description>

      <title>Typing to Think, Speaking to Prompt</title>
      <link>https://www.kvncnnlly.com/2025-08-13-typing-as-thinking-or-not/</link>
      <description>My earlier post about the rise of voice as a UI had me pondering what exactly is it that makes voice input ideal in some circumstances and entirely undesired in others. Spoken language is faster per word and, in a naive economic sense, “better”1. And yet, there are times where I have no interest in “going fast”. Why?
This topic makes me think of Andy Clark’s Supersizing the Mind, which opens with a famous Feynman quote about insisting that his “daily notes” were not simply a record of his activities but his actual thinking:</description>

      <title>Is MCP just a WSDL Reboot for LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://relantic.com/radar/mcp-wsdl.html</link>
      <description>If the Model Context Protocol gives you 2005 vibes, you’re not imagining it. MCP feels like the good part of the old web-services dream brought forward for AI agents: describe what you can do, let a generic client discover it, and integrate without bespoke glue. That was the pitch behind WSDL in the Web 2.0 era—Web Services Description Language—an XML contract where a service declared its operations, messages, and types so tools could generate clients automatically. If you’ve never seen it, the original specs still read like a time capsule: WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0.</description>

      <description>The feed-forward network in an LLM processes context vectors one at a time. This feels like it would cause similar issues to the old fixed-length bottleneck, even though it almost certainly does not.</description>

      <description>Warning: English is not my native language and I refused to ask an LLM to write this for me, so at least you got a somewhat human blogpost in exchange for some bad english :P
I’ve had an interest in photography for a long time, I remember being fascinated by it in highschool and since then I still enjoy looking at pictures, reading about photography (suffering from GAS) and most of all, taking pictures.</description>

      <link>https://ahmedhosssam.github.io/posts/why-i-quit-competitive-programming/</link>
      <description>TL;DR # I tried competitive programming for a whole year and it didn’t work out well for me, I didn’t enjoy it and didn’t achieve anything remarkable as well. So it’s better to take the L and move on and try other things I wanted to try, but I couldn’t because of competitive programming. For the rest of the article I’m going to talk about the sunk cost fallacy.</description>

      <title>Lasso Transactions as an alternative to Copyright</title>
      <link>https://rasmuskirk.com/articles/2025-06-18_lasso-transactions-as-an-alternative-to-copyright/</link>
      <description>Often, people who oppose copyright give weak
                  excuses as for how a market would sustain artists
                  creating work, without the government creating an
                  artificial monopoly on said work. In a recent
                  conversation with one of my friends who also oppose
                  many aspects of the current copyright system, we
                  brainstormed alternatives. I opposed the traditional
                  donation model as it’s highly subject to free-rider
                  problem, and demanded that a new model be
                  created1, if we should
                  reasonably expect to convince people to oppose
                  copyright.</description>
