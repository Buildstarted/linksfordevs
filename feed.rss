      <title>Memcached vs Redis - More Different Than You Would Expect</title>

      <description>Memcached and Redis. More different than first appearances would suggest.  From how they use memory to how they expire items, the differences are not as subtle as you would expect.

      <description>Say you are writing a macro that wants to behave differently depending on whether it is expanded inside a coroutine or not. Specifically, you want to expand to return in a regular function, but co_return in a coroutine. template&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T&amp;amp;&amp;amp; TraceValue(T&amp;amp;&amp;amp;</description>

      <title>The Fundamentals of Testing with Persistence Layers </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/Testing-With-Persistence-Layers/</link>
      <description>Mocking out dependencies such as databases and other persistence layers lead to ineffective tests. Unfortunately, our industry is also focused on function-level testing to the exclusion of all else, so few are trained on how to write any other type of test. This article seeks to correct the issue by reintroducing the concept of testing with databases.</description>

      <title>How the biggest consumer apps got their first 1,000 users - Issue 25</title>
      <link>https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-apps-got</link>
      <description>Considering every startup confronts this question at some point, I was surprised by how little has been written about it. Particularly anything actionable. So I decided to do my own digging. I spent the past month personally reaching out to founders, scouring interviews, and tapping the Twitterverse. Below, you’ll find first-hand accounts of how essentially every major consumer app acquired their earliest users, including Tinder, Uber, Superhuman, TikTok, Product Hunt, Yelp, and over a dozen more. Enjoy!</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/introducing-experimental-opentelemetry-support-in-the-azure-sdk-for-net/</link>
      <description>Cloud-hosted apps are often composed of many services that are integrated together in some fashion. For example, processing a single request might involve: Calling an Azure Storage service. Posting an event to Azure Event Hubs. Calling a custom authentication backend. With an increasing number of moving pieces comes an increasing number of distributed failure points.</description>

      <link>http://tomasp.net/blog/2021/popup-from-hell/</link>
      <description> What can we learn from an annoying pop-up ad that cannot be closed? In this post,
I continue theme that I started in my interactive Commodore 64 BASIC essay, which is to look
at past programming systems and see what interesting past ideas have been lost. I look at the
growing opacity of web programs and how technologies like WebAssembly and Canvas-based
rendering limit extensibility. Is this an accident, or an inevitable law of software evolution?</description>

      <title>Democracy vs Autocracy</title>
      <link>https://camhashemi.com/posts/democracy-autocracy/</link>
      <description>Every group decision falls on a spectrum, from democratic to autocratic.
Democratic decisions are derived from consensus, while autocratic decisions are made by a single person.
A dictator can be popular as much as a democracy can be tyrannical. Democracy is not inherently good as autocracy is not inherently bad. The success of each style depends on their execution within a context.
The Context Autocracy Autocracy has the advantage of efficiency.</description>

      <description>It feels as if we&amp;#39;re at the tail end of the first era of social media in the West. Looking back at the companies that have survived, certain application architectural choices are ubiquitous.
