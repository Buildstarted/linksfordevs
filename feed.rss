      <title>AI Helps Unravel a Cause of Alzheimer’s Disease and Identify a Therapeutic Candidate</title>
      <link>https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate</link>
      <description>A new study found that a gene recently recognized as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease is actually a cause of it, due to its previously unknown secondary function that triggers a pathway that disrupts how cells in the brain turn genes on and off.</description>

      <description>For years I’ve wanted to build a super-dense electronic-music compressor: keep only the loops and phase cues that really matter, then re-synthesise the track perfectly. Evenings and weekends, however, were never long enough to design the model, write the maths, and wrangle PyTorch. Recently I opened ChatGPT running the …</description>

      <title>The Programmer's Climb</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/programmers-climb/</link>
      <description>As a computer science undergrad in the mid-90s, my “Introduction to Programming” course in the very first semester was modeled after the legendary “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” by Abelson and Sussman.
For a quarter-century at MIT, Abelson, Sussman, and colleagues used Scheme to teach freshmen how to manufacture abstractions almost artisanally from scratch. Rooted in the Lisp ethos, the premise was that by understanding a handful of primitives and mastering a small set of combinators, students could build a platonic ladder of abstractions—a veritable cathedral of computation—and still reason about every brick. This pedagogical approach involved first creating abstractions to model the problem domain, effectively designing a custom language in which the final solution could then be expressed cleanly, almost self-evidently.</description>

      <link>https://taras.glek.net/posts/create-missing-rss-feeds-with-llms/</link>
      <description>It used to be that blogs all had RSS feeds. Somehow there are more blogs than ever before, but some people do not bother with setting up an RSS feed.
The following blogs have nice content, but are annoying to follow without RSS.
https://aider.chat/blog/ https://jkatz05.com/ https://getreuer.info/ Every time I stumble on one of these, it takes me a while to remember a fun workaround. I decided to write this down as a blog post so I have an easier time looking up the details.</description>

      <link>https://www.withentropy.com/blog/2025-04-21-beating_the_crowd/</link>
      <description>Suppose you are participating in an auction for a box. Nobody knows exactly what is in the box, but they are bidding on it for various reasons; some think they can make money, some might have sentimental reasons, and others might just be having fun. You yourself are trying to make money. You asked around a bit, did some research, and think that you have a good estimate for the value of the box. You think it’s worth $10,000 and decide to bid $9,000.</description>
