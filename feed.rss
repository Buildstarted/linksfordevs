      <description>Is it just me or is today&amp;#39;s internet boring and overly commercialized?

      <title>The Modern Mathematics of Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04026</link>
      <description>We describe the new field of mathematical analysis of deep learning. This
field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within
the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the
outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role
of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of
dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite
the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why
deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which
fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which
way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to
these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more
detail.</description>

      <title>Is software development really a dead-end job after age 35-40?</title>
      <link>https://www.quora.com/Is-software-development-really-a-dead-end-job-after-age-35-40</link>
      <description>Last year, my 45th, having just left Facebook and then taking a break, I wound up running a number of interviews and doing really horribly, until I found the right discipline for the eclectic set of skills I’ve developed over these years. The cutoff varies, depending on your time in the industry. Since I skipped college and went straight into the business, it really started around 40 for me. The work is there, the opportunities are there, but the interviews and expectations on you change. People are going to want more expertise and knowledge out of you than key-pressing. They’re going to expect an architect, an engineer, a solutions designer, an instructor, a risk analyzer, a mentor.. “I like to get my hands dirty” stops implying team player and starts suggesting “micro-manager” or under-development of your engineering skills (this candidate won’t build our new micro-service architecture, instead manually write html files at 10 words per minute while telling us all about the new hotness in apache from 6 years ago). The angle of many of your interviews is going to change. Your adaptability, enthusiasm for learning, those are obstacles as you shift from talking to junior managers to hiring managers and executives and CTOs. You’re also going to be increasingly likely to be interviewed as a team-match by people who are (perhaps not aware they’re going to be) junior to you. I had several Google all-day Google interviews last year which were some of the best/worst I’ve ever experienced. Acing thru the big-picture interviews, I struggled bitterly in the key-word-matching-disguised-as-coding-interview tests: The interviewer presents a fairly trivial problem with no context. ([edit] And when they say ‘imagine you’re working with a co-worker’ in these: Would you tolerate that from a co-worker? What am I, stack overflow incarnate?) Or they present a fairly specific yet abstract problem and propose a skeleton approach: “Oh, I wouldn’t take this approach because REALLY GOOD REASONS”. The interviewer feels the top of their head: was that static or a really low flying aircraft? “We could come back to that, but lets start with this”. Great: I wrote a multi-tasking operating system in assembler at the age of 14 and you want me to slog thru this 101 problem and say “linked list” at the right moment so you can ask me “when would a linked list be bad”, I can try not to quip “when it has you using it” and then you can say “what if we had billions of entries”. In these interviews I try to remember the consultants I&amp;#39;ve had to work with. Knew all the high-level jargon but couldn&amp;#39;t tell you how a pointer works. That doesn&amp;#39;t make it any less uncomfortable knowing we&amp;#39;re going to waste 45 minutes obtaining phone-screen level stuff by someone who engages you as though Linked Lists are special magic. As an interviewee, this is incredibly difficult because I&amp;#39;m applying for a senior role, and now 45 minutes of my window is spent discussing linked lists 101. What makes this grate so badly is that sense of being on a rail. I asked one interviewer: Would you have used a linked list to solve the first problem? Oh no, it obviously wouldn&amp;#39;t scale. Do you know I&amp;#39;m interviewing for a senior position? I&amp;#39;m filling in for another interviewer, I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what position we&amp;#39;re interviewing you for, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have expected a senior to struggle so much with the initial linked-list problem. He wouldn&amp;#39;t have used a linked list to solve his own linked-list problem... If this was a co-worker, I&amp;#39;d sit them down and walk them through applications and concerns with doubly vs single, circular, intrusive vs non-intrusive, figure out what facet of their requirement I’ve missed or they haven’t expressed, or what the gap in their knowledge is. In some of these 101 questions, I&amp;#39;ve actually been able to do this - come off the rail, so to speak - and that&amp;#39;s actually been great. But, again: It all comes back down to the fear that you&amp;#39;re losing 45 minutes of your window to someone&amp;#39;s script. Again: it’s the rail. It’s like being asked to do finger painting while you wait for a real interviewer. I would certainly have reservations about hiring someone who did well in one of those interviews. Seriously? You chose an algorithmX to solve that problem? And you had to have a back-and-forth with the interviewer to finally decide to use an algorithmY to solve it for stage 2 and algorithmZ to solve it for stage 3? Yeesh. A bigger challenge, the bigger the company, is the interviewers recognizing that you&amp;#39;re being interviewed because you stand out in some field; that you might be a peer. During my last round with Google, I didn’t do so well. One engineer asked me to write a very specific application, continually declined requests to clarify what part of the app he might want me to focus on, bemoaned my outlining the scope of what he’d just presented me, and then let me fall into a “well, this part is the most complex, so I’m going there” trap. Ultimately, he explicitly wanted to discuss a single function of a mundane part of the app. After the interview was officially over, he indicated that he had worked on the reference implementation of this part and had recently rewritten it with the “X Y Z algorithm” - wait: I mentioned that during the first 5 minutes of the interview! “No, you said X Z Y”. A second facet of this manifests in the sort of cloak-and-daggery aspect of people using storied examples. It can be challenging to get them to recognize &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m interviewing here precisely because I know about this kind of thing&amp;quot;. In two other cases, the engineers were put-off by my recognition of the problem and assumed I had “had this one before”. Seriously? You’ve read my resume, and you chose a question based on my experience, and then you are *surprised* that I say “oh this?” The first came in and sketched a distributed multi-process debugging problem, and I jokingly said “like, hunt the ooming java process?” He looked offended. But went ahead and gave me a 5 minute explanation of the system. I summarized “So it’s an ad-market with a web-based front end?” I spent a few seconds double-checking I had not just said something awful about his mother. I took a minute to make him aware we were on the same page because experience, and he responded really well to that. Asked me to walk him thru my thinking. But, tbh, I was frustrated at this point, so I gambled on instead showing him a totally different approach that I would build or work with producers/managers to get the engineers to build-in themselves. I wanted to get away from the “you read this on stack overflow” suspicion. Instead of treating this as a one-time issue, I identified it as a recurring issue, he argued but I pointed out: we’ve *both* done this multiple times. We know what the cause is, it’s the where and restoration-of-service that we care about. Ok, he bought that. At the end he confided that this was completely not what they were looking for in this particular question, but that he’d never had a candidate present the approach I had and that he’d actually be rethinking the question entirely. It was a difficult interview session, largely because the interviewer seemed so reluctant to consider that someone who hadn&amp;#39;t worked at Google yet could have experienced a scenario like this. The second case … Presented me with a nice solid practical problem. A variation of something I’ve had to deal with in several scenarios, but he again seemed unaware of that. This bewilders me, because translating solutions into metaphors so that they can be reapplied is a basic aspect of engineering. In retrospect, he became increasingly annoyed as I moved towards a subtly different path than the one he seemed to be pushing for, with me - at the time - misreading the pushes as discussion bait. Ultimately I arrived close to his solution with a few improvements that he credited to his guidance. His final good humor fell away during the post-interview, when I pointed out that those improvements were specifically this point I’d made and that point I’d made, and that I’d been aiming towards this particular set of approaches from the offset (pointing to one of them still on the board). He specifically intimated that, because that wasn’t the system he’d implemented 10 years ago, we couldn’t know if it would have been better. [edit] I describe the above poorly, he&amp;#39;d specifically asked for feedback, and I was describing like he&amp;#39;d been trying to push me to a particular goal. Ultimately, this was a solved problem to both of us, but this interviewer just wasn’t ready to actually be challenged on it. His solution was elegant and simple; mine was similar with with a twist rather than an increment in complexity. It also involved an informed gamble that gave it more longevity than his. -Edit: This interviewer opened saying that he wanted us to treat this as an active problem we were trying to solve, working together with myself as lead to evaluate the level of seniority I was suited for. At each step he acknowledged the directions. The problem is either an unwillingness by an engineer to see someone else has already solved their problem (a common conceit among the big tech companies) or they didn’t believe my resume and were expecting a vastly less experienced engineer that they would prove to be a fraud through not knowing the word “linked list”. In either case, it’s agonizingly painful, [edit] and something worth finding a way to practice and prepare for. Attending conventions is a good way to find peers to challenge yourself with. I told one interviewer: How much do you know about modern CPU architecture? Because if what matters to you is whether I have a linked list implementation in L1 cache rather than RAM full of years of practical experience, knowledge of the various different implementations, plus intrusive vs non-intrusive caveats, cache coherence implications, etc, etc… We can stop here. I’ve discovered that in many of these scenarios, the interviewer is possibly overwhelmed or uncomfortable with your level of experience to the degree they struggle to find a common ground, and the interview is largely an attempt to try and figure out some way that they can disprove your claims or map your experience onto theirs. Have a couple of interesting problems up your sleeve. If you sit down and work on a meaningful project, you would do far better together than trying to randomly figure out an algorithm or data-structure you can sit around and discuss like a water-cooler conversation. The key to success, for me, came in finding companies that were capable of being interview*ed*. When I interviewed at Facebook in 2014, that was still very much the case, and Facebook’s interviews, although nail biting, were also utterly engaging. Google, LinkedIn, and some of the other big-tech companies, the entire process seems to presume you are a bug under a microscope. The slightest indication you might be looking back and you scare or anger them off. You can probably expect more churn, you’ll need more persistence and patience, but it’s not because the work is no-longer there.</description>

      <description>Being a disciple to the Open Source movement I often have to explain why it is better to make code public than private. Apart from the usual arguments such as “access to better security”, “trust through transparency” or “the design is the intellectual property”, I came up with the argument of true value. Let me explain.</description>

      <title>Why does storing a set take the same space as storing a list?</title>
      <link>https://bahadirtuluce.com/why-does-storing-a-set-take-the-same-space-as-storing-a-list</link>
      <description>In a typical serialization library, encoding a collection gets carried out in the same way for lists (ordered) and sets (order-agnostic). Regardless of the collection type, the elements are simply written one after the other. This means that the encoded bytes implicitly carry the information of the order of elements. Is it possible to isolate this information, eliminate it from the encoding, therefore end up with a more compact byte representation? ...</description>

      <title>How does a fighter jet lock onto and keep track of an enemy aircraft? Can an aircraft detect that it has been locked onto, or is it just a convenient plot device in movies?</title>
      <link>https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-fighter-jet-lock-onto-and-keep-track-of-an-enemy-aircraft-Can-an-aircraft-detect-that-it-has-been-locked-onto-or-is-it-just-a-convenient-plot-device-in-movies?share=1</link>
      <description>The primary technology that a military aircraft uses to lock and track an enemy aircraft is its onboard radar.  Aircraft radars typically have two modes: search and track.  In search mode, the radar sweeps a radio beam across the sky in a zig-zag pattern.  When the radio beam is reflected by a target aircraft, an indication is shown on the radar display.  In search mode, no single aircraft is being tracked, but the pilot can usually tell generally what a particular radar return is doing because with each successive sweep, the radar return moves slightly. This is an example of the fire control radar display for an F-16 Fighting Falcon when the radar is in a search mode:   Each white brick is a radar return.  Because the radar is only scanning, not tracking, no other information is available about the radar targets.  (There is one exception: The Doppler shift of the radar return can be measured, to estimate how fast the aircraft traveling towards or away from you, much like the pitch of an oncoming train&amp;#39;s whistle can tell you how fast it&amp;#39;s coming at you.  This is displayed as the small white trend line originating from each brick.) Note that the cursors are over the bottom-most brick (closest to our aircraft).  The pilot is ready to lock up this target.  This will put the radar into a track mode.  In track mode, the radar focuses its energy on a particular target.  Because the radar is actually tracking a target, and not just displaying bricks when it gets a reflection back, it can tell the pilot a lot more about the target.  This is what the F-16&amp;#39;s fire control radar display looks like when a target is locked:   Along the top we have a lot of information about what our radar target is doing: Its aspect angle (angle between its nose position and our nose position) is 160&amp;#176; to the left,its heading is 190&amp;#176;,its airspeed is 450 knots,and our closure rate is 828 knots.With this information, the pilot gets a much better idea of what the aircraft is doing, but at the expense of information about other aircraft in the area. Note that in the above picture, the bottom-most (closest) target is locked (circle around it), the two targets further away are tracked (yellow squares), and there are two radar returns even further away (white bricks).  This is demonstrating an advanced feature of modern radars, situational awareness modes.  A radar in SAM combines both tracking and scanning to allow a pilot to track one or a small number of &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; targets while not losing the big picture of what other targets are doing.  In this mode, the radar beam sweeps the sky, while briefly and regularly pausing its scan to check up on a locked target. Note that all of this comes with tradeoffs.  In the end, a radar is only as powerful as it is, and you can put a lot of radar energy on one target, or spread it out weakly throughout the sky, or some compromise in between.  In the above photo you can see two vertical bars spanning the height of the display -- these are the azimuth scan limits.  It&amp;#39;s the aircraft&amp;#39;s way of telling you, &amp;quot;OK, I can both track this target, and scan for other targets, but in return, I&amp;#39;m only going to scan a 40&amp;#176; wide cone in front of the aircraft, instead of the usual 60&amp;#176;.  Radar, like life, is full of tradeoffs. An important thing to note is that a radar lock is not always required to launch weapons at a target.  For guns kills, if the aircraft has a radar lock on a target, it can accurately gauge range to the target, and provide the pilot with the appropriate corrections for lead and gravity drop, to get an accurate guns kill.  Without the radar, the pilot&amp;#39;s own judgement must be used. As an example of that, let&amp;#39;s take a look at the F-16&amp;#39;s HUD (heads-up display) when in the process of employing guns at a radar-locked target:    It becomes really simple: That small circle labeled &amp;quot;bullets at target range&amp;quot; is called the &amp;quot;death dot&amp;quot; by F-16 pilots.  Basically, it represents where the cannon rounds would land if you fired right now, and the rounds traveled the distance between you and the locked target.  In other words, if you want a solid guns kill, simply fly the death dot onto the airplane.  Super simple. But what if there&amp;#39;s no radar lock?  Well now the HUD looks like this:   No death dot -- but you still have the funnel.  The funnel represents the path the cannon rounds would travel out in front of you if you fired right now.  The width of the funnel is equal to the apparent width of a predetermined wingspan at that particular range.  So, if you didn&amp;#39;t have a lock on your target, but you knew it had a wingspan of 35 feet, you could dial in 35 feet, then fly the funnel until the width exactly lined up with the width of the enemy aircraft&amp;#39;s wings, then squeeze the trigger. And what about missiles?  Again, a radar lock is not required.  For heat-seeking missiles, a radar lock is only used to train the seeker head onto the target.  Without a radar lock, the seeker head scans the sky looking for &amp;quot;bright&amp;quot; (hot) objects, and when it finds one, it plays a distinctive whining tone to the pilot.  The pilot does not need radar in this case, he just needs to maneuver his aircraft until he has &amp;quot;good tone,&amp;quot; and then fire the missile.  The radar only makes this process faster. Now, radar-guided missiles come in two varieties: passive and active.  Passive radar missiles do require a radar lock, because these missiles use the aircraft&amp;#39;s reflected radar energy to track the target. Active radar missiles however have their own onboard radar, which locks and tracks a target.  But this radar is on a one-way trip, so it&amp;#39;s considerably less expensive (and less powerful) than the aircraft&amp;#39;s radar.  So, these missiles normally get some guidance help from the launching aircraft until they fly close enough to the target where they can turn on their own radar and &amp;quot;go active.&amp;quot;  (This allows the launching aircraft to turn away and defend itself.)  It is possible to fire an active radar missile with no radar lock (so-called &amp;quot;maddog&amp;quot;); in this case, the missile will fly until it&amp;#39;s nearly out of fuel, and then it will turn on its radar and pursue the first target it sees.  This is not a recommended strategy if there are friendly aircraft in close proximity to the enemy. As to the last part of your question -- yes, an aircraft can tell if a radar is painting it or locked onto it.  Radar is just radio waves, and just as your FM radio converts radio waves into sound, so can an aircraft analyze incoming radio signals to figure out who&amp;#39;s doing what.  This is called an RWR, or radar warning receiver, and has both a video and audio component.  This is a typical RWR display:   Although an aircraft&amp;#39;s radar can only scan out in front of the aircraft, an aircraft can listen for incoming radar signals in any direction, so the scope is 360&amp;#176;.  A digital signal processor looks for recognizable radio &amp;quot;chirps&amp;quot; that correspond to known radars, and displays their azimuth on the scope.  A chirp is a distinctive waveform that a radio uses.  See, if two radios use the same waveform simultaneously, they&amp;#39;ll confuse each other, because each radio won&amp;#39;t know which radar returns are from its own transmitter.  To prevent this, different radios tend to use distinct waveforms.  This can also be used by the target aircraft to identify the type of radar being used, and therefore possibly, the type of aircraft. In this display, the RWR has detected an F-15 (15 with a hat on it indicating aircraft) at the 7-o&amp;#39;clock position.  The strength of the radar is plotted as distance from the center -- the closer to the center, the stronger the detected radar signal, and therefore possibly the closer the transmitting aircraft. Detected at the 12- to 1-o&amp;#39;clock position are two surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, an SA-5 &amp;quot;Gammon&amp;quot; and an SA-6 &amp;quot;Gainful&amp;quot;.  These are Russian SAM launching radars and represent a serious threat.  The RWR computer has determined the SA-6 to be the highest priority threat in the area, and thus has enclosed it with a diamond. RWR also has an audio component.  Each time a new radar signal is detected, it is converted into an audio wave and played for the pilot.  Because different radars &amp;quot;sound&amp;quot; different, pilots learn to recognize different airborne or surface threats by their distinctive tones.  The sound is also an important cue to tell the pilot what the radar is doing: If the sound plays once, or intermittently, it means the radar is only painting our aircraft (in search mode).  If a sound plays continuously, the radar has locked onto our aircraft and is in track mode, and thus the pilot&amp;#39;s immediate attention is demanded.  In some cases, the RWR can tell if the radar is in launch mode (sending radar data to a passive radar-guided missile), or if the radar is that of an active radar-guided missile.  In either of these cases, a distinctive missile launch tone is played and the pilot is advised to immediately act to counter the threat.  Note that the RWR has no way of knowing if a heat-seeking missile is on its way to our aircraft. Aside from radar, there are other technologies that are used to lock on to enemy aircraft and ground targets.  A targeting pod is a very powerful camera mounted on an articulating swivel that allows it to look in nearly every direction.  This camera is connected to image processor that is able to tell apart vehicles and buildings from surrounding terrain, and track moving targets.  This is the SNIPER XR targeting pod:   And this is what the pilot sees when he operates it:   The pod is able to track vehicles day and night, using visual or infra-red cameras.  Heat-seeking missiles obviously use this same technology to home in on aircraft, and electro-optical missiles use this technology to track ground targets. Lastly, there are laser-guided missiles as well.  These &amp;quot;beam riders&amp;quot; follow a laser beam emanating from the aircraft to the target.  Many ground vehicles use laser rangefinders as well, and some aircraft include a laser warning system (LWS) that works similarly to an RWR, but displays incoming laser signals instead.</description>
