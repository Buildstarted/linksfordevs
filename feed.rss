      <title>Unpacking Elixir: Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://underjord.io/unpacking-elixir-concurrency.html</link>
      <description>Elixir is the thing I do most of my public writing and speaking about. It is my default programming language for the last 5-6 years. It suits my brain. Performs well for the kind of work I typically do. And using it I have experienced very few drawbacks. Rather than writing yet another post trying to widely summarize what I think is beneficial about the language I want to try and go a bit deeper on one particular aspect I like. Not incredibly technically deep, but unpack the concepts more thoroughly. I hope this will be a series of stand-alone posts. We will see. This time we unpack Elixir concurrency (and parallelism).</description>

      <title>Detecting boomerang values in zero-knowledge circuits using tag analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.zksecurity.xyz/blog/posts/boomerang/</link>
      <description>zkApps (zero-knowledge applications) are meant to be provable translations of computer programs. That is, they should behave like the computer programs they are intending to represent, while also providing proofs of correct execution that can accompany program outputs. But as we’ve talked about before, translating programs into provable programs is not a straight forward process. To prove executions, zkApps attempt to “witness” all the important parts of an execution trace. They seek to assert every nook and corner specified (explicitely or implicitely) in the original application.</description>

What is Factorio: Space Age?kovarex


 Factorio: Space Age continues the player&amp;#39;s journey after launching rockets into space. Discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms.



 Vanilla Factorio ends by launching the rocket into space, so I always expected it to be quite obvious what we are going to do next.
 Honestly the space platform related gameplay was actually planned a very long time ago, and we had shown a little bit in FFF-74.

      <description>While a system without disks or network could be useful for some purposes, before we can do very much with FreeBSD, we’re going to want those devices. Firecracker supports Virtio block and network devices and exposes them to virtual machines as mmio (memory-mapped I/O) devices. First step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Add device virtio_mmio to the Firecracker kernel configuration.</description>

      <description>As part of taking over the editorial job of the WeAreDevelopers newsletter, I needed to get all the links from older editions and import them into a spreadsheet. Eventually I will write a scraping script, but there is a much simpler way to get all the links from a web site into a spreadsheet: browser developer tools. You can follow how that’s done in this video:</description>

      <link>https://jamesg.blog/2023/06/03/website-index/</link>
      <description>At Homebrew Website Club this week, we discussed book indexes (with the Chicago Manual of Style nearby as a reference, of course!). This got me thinking about what a web index may look like for a blog: a page formatted like a book index where you can see articles that mention unique concepts on your blog. Book indexes are useful tools for navigating information. Given a concept, the index tells you where to find out more. I was curious about what this may look like for a blog.</description>
