      <title>Linux on Apple Silicon with Alyssa Rosenzweig - Software Engineering Daily</title>
      <link>https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/10/15/linux-apple-silicon-alyssa-rosenzweig/</link>
      <description>Asahi Linux is a project that aims to port Linux to Apple Silicon chips, which use a custom ARM-based architecture. The project is fundamentally important given the popularity of Apple Silicon Macs, and it’s also a heroic effort because Apple Silicon is an entirely undocumented platform. Alyssa Rosenzweig is a well-known computer scientist who describes</description>

      <title>LIVE CODING - WordPress Migration to Blazor - PART 3</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=yOppdLvXYk8</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s time! WordPress on AWS LightSail has been non-stop problems for nearly 2 years now.

Time for a change.

I&amp;#39;ll be looking into using LinkDotNet.Blog by Steven Giesel as my blog engine of choice. But migrations are never easy, so this will be the first of many sessions trying to figure out how I can get my blog setup before going live.

Remember -- I need to keep as many links active as possible so I don&amp;#39;t ruin my SEO!

      <description>This post is an exploration of the open data available at the Swedish parliament. They have done an amazing job classifying and making the data accessible though an API. The post is inspired by Umar Butlers post Mapping (almost) every law, regulation and case in Australia which explained every step along the way in a very thorough manner.</description>

      <description>Thousands of jobs get slashed, but CEO payouts keep growing. Why are workers bearing the brunt while execs walk away richer than ever? Here’s how to fix the “shared sacrifice” myth.

      <description>Basing how likely you are at succeeding at something on statistics(let&amp;#39;s call it the frequentist worldview) is part of one of the worst types of ideas, it&amp;#39;s the type of idea that is very wrong and has very bad consequences but simultaneously sounds reasonable and scientific.</description>

      <title>.NET Conf 2024 - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JbbgsNTjPoo</link>
      <description>NET Conf has been a virtual event since the beginning, and this year we’re celebrating our 14th online conference. We always strive to create a world class, engaging, virtual experience for all our attendees no matter where they are. Over the years we&amp;#39;ve expanded our content and our reach. We now draw over 100 thousand live viewers and sponsor hundreds of local events around the world.

Over the course of the three days we provide a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. We have sessions streaming 24/7 between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee parties where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.

      <title>Consuming Amazon AWS Notifications using MassTransit</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=UVg6tLPsR3Y</link>
      <description>Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses its Simple Notification Service (SNS) extensively to route all types of events. In this video, I cover a new sample that shows how to consume SNS events using MassTransit and Amazon SQS. The Simple Email Service (SES) sends bounce and complaint notifications via SNS, and this sample consumes those notifications so that they can be handled by your application domain.

Sample: https://github.com/MassTransit/Sample-AmazonSES
