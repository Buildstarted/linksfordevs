      <title>The Failed Commodification Of Technical Work — Ludicity</title>
      <link>https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/the-failed-commodification-of-technical-work/</link>
      <description>The most talented data engineer I know, and my first manager, is a man that loves cooking. I mean, you might think you love cooking, but this guy loves cooking. The most excited text message I received this year was from him, proudly sharing the goddamn analytics on the heat distribution of chicken in his oven with his newly imported thermometer. We&amp;#39;re talking about a culinary madman, capable of anything. The first book he gave me was not remotely related to any technical stack we ran, but was instead a 2,438 page manifesto on cooking. My current relationship is built on the back of a meal he advised me to prepare on the third date.</description>

      <title>The Story of Titanium</title>
      <link>https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-story-of-titanium</link>
      <description>The earth contains a lot of titanium - it’s the ninth most abundant element in the earth’s crust. By mass, there’s more titanium in the earth’s crust than carbon by a factor of nearly 30, and more titanium than copper by a factor of nearly 100. But despite its abundance, it&amp;#39;s only recently that civilization has been able to use titanium as a metal (titanium dioxide has been in use somewhat longer as a paint pigment). Because titanium so readily bonds with oxygen and other elements, it doesn’t occur at all in metallic form in nature.</description>

      <title>Clostridioides difficile spores tolerate disinfection with sodium hypochlorite disinfectant and remain viable within surgical scrubs and gown fabrics</title>
      <link>https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.001418</link>
      <description>&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;Clostridioides difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea globally. Its spores have been implicated in the prevalence of &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; infection due to their resistance and transmission ability between surfaces. Currently, disinfectants such as chlorine-releasing agents (CRAs) and hydrogen peroxide are used to decontaminate and reduce the incidence of infections in clinical environments. Our previous research demonstrated the ability of &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores to survive exposure to recommended concentrations of sodium dichloroisocyanurate in liquid form and within personal protective fabrics such as surgical gowns; however, the present study examined the spore response to clinical in-use concentrations of sodium hypochlorite. Spores were exposed to a 10 min contact time of 1000, 5000 and 10 000 p.p.m. sodium hypochlorite, and spore recovery was determined. To understand whether biocide-exposed spores transmitted across clinical surfaces in vitro, biocide-exposed spores were spiked onto surgical scrubs and patient gowns and recovery was determined by a plate transfer assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to establish if there were any morphological changes to the outer spore coat. The results revealed that viable biocide-exposed &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores can be recovered from surgical scrubs and patient gowns, with no observable changes to spore morphology, highlighting the potential of these fabrics as vectors of spore transmission. This study demonstrates that alternative strategies should be urgently sought to disinfect &amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160;C. difficile&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#160; spores to break the chain of transmission in clinical environments.</description>
