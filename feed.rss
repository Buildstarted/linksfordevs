      <title>Visualize Your Software Architecture With The C4 Model</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/visualize-your-software-architecture-with-the-c4-model</link>
      <description> Software architecture diagrams are a great way to communicate how you are planning to build a software system or how an existing software system works.
However, the majority of software architecture diagrams I&amp;#39;ve seen are a total mess.
If only there was a standard way to visualize your software architecture...
Enter the C4 model, which stands for context, containers, components, and code.
The C4 model is a lightweight approach to describing your software architecture.
And it&amp;#39;s essentially just two things, a predefined set of common abstractions and four diagram types: - Context diagram - high-level view of the system - Container diagram - shows the objects running inside a system - Component diagram - shows the building blocks that make each container - Code diagram - rarely used, typically UML or ER diagram
Let&amp;#39;s see how we can use the C4 model to visualize our software architecture.</description>

      <title>Configure Auto Scaling in Azure App Service</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/configure-auto-scaling-in-azure-app-service/</link>
      <description>This post is about configuring automatic scaling in Azure App Service. Automatic scaling is a new feature available in Azure App Service scale out configuration. The feature of automatic scaling is a novel way to expand the capacity of your web applications and App Service Plans without having to make scaling decisions yourself. It differs from the existing Azure autoscale, which allows you to specify scaling rules according to schedules and resources. With automatic scaling, you can modify scaling settings to enhance your application’s performance and prevent delays in starting up. This Automatic scaling feature is in preview. And it is available for Premium Pv2 and Pv3 pricing tiers, and supported for all app types: Windows, Linux, and Windows container.</description>

      <link>https://douglasorr.github.io/2023-03-deep-metaphors/article.html</link>
      <description>As a deep learning researcher, I find my self doing metaphor thinking quite a lot. Metaphor thinking is where you leap into a metaphor, a figure of speech, and use it to explore a subject as if it exists wholly within the metaphor. I suppose &amp;quot;to leap in &amp;amp; explore&amp;quot; in that sentence was itself metaphor thinking (or metaphor speaking).</description>

      <description>Functor Early into learning Haskell, we’re introduced to the Functor typeclass and how to fmap our way around with it. fmap is a structure-preserving operation that lets us transform the value wrapped by the structure:
class Functor f where fmap :: (a -&amp;gt; b) -&amp;gt; f a -&amp;gt; f b Maybe has a Functor instance:
maybeFunctor :: Maybe Int -&amp;gt; Maybe String maybeFunctor mInt = fmap show mInt [] also has a Functor instance:</description>

      <title>The kind of thinking computer science enables</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2023-05-11_thinking_cs/</link>
      <description>I believe computer science plays as integral of a part to a well-rounded liberal arts education as does mathematics and linguistics. Why? A liberal arts education is designed to help you think in new and better ways. Computer science teaches novel ways of thinking, reasoning, and approaching problems that are hard to get anywhere else.
I took a class on pedagogy when I encountered this puzzle. I answered the question easily, and I caught myself using reasoning patterns from work in programming coming to the forefront.</description>
