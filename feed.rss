      <title>Pushing UI changes from Blazor Server to browser on server raised events</title>
      <link>https://swimburger.net/blog/dotnet/pushing-ui-changes-from-blazor-server-to-browser-on-server-raised-events</link>
      <description>Blazor Server is built on SignalR, and SignalR is built on websockets among other techniques. The combination of these technologies allow Blazor Server to push UI changes into the client without the client requesting those changes.</description>

      <title>14,000x Speedup - James Hiebert&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>http://james.hiebert.name/blog/work/2015/09/14/CS-FTW.html</link>
      <description>In my job as a scientific software developer, I tend to write a lot of code. And most people who haven’t been through a Computer Science degree tend to think that CS is “just” about slinging code at the screen and then running it. I have a good working relationship with many of my colleagues and co-workers with other backgrounds… Physics, Climate Science, Biology, etc. But when it comes to developing software, I get the distinct impression that people think, “Hey, how hard could this be?! We just write down a few instructions about what we want the computer to do, hit the execute button and the, ‘Blamo!’, we get our answer!”</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX8wT0mO5qg</link>
      <description>Back in the State of the Union, we mentioned an upcoming live meeting open to all. We have scheduled the first of these for Tuesday, October 13th, at 11:30-12:30 Eastern Daylight Time. For this first meeting, the format will be a panel discussion with the Board of Directors, Committee Chairs, and the Executive Director. The event will feature live Q&amp;amp;A from questions submitted from the public. We&amp;#39;ll also take questions in advance.

We recognize that the audience for .NET is global and as we continue to hold these quarterly, we will vary the time to accommodate different time zones. The full recording will always be available afterwards.</description>

      <title>JDK 15 Security Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://seanjmullan.org/blog/2020/10/13/jdk15</link>
      <description>JDK 15 was released on September 15, 2020! As with
my previous blogs for JDK 14,
JDK 13,
and JDK 12, I
have compiled a list of what I think are the most interesting and useful
security enhancements in this release.  I have also grouped
them into appropriate categories (crypto, TLS, etc) which should make
it easier to find out what has changed in each specific area.
The JDK 15 Release Notes
also contain further details on these and other enhancements.</description>

      <title>Advice to my young self: forget side projects and focus on your job</title>
      <link>https://manuel.darcemont.fr/posts/focus-on-jour-job/</link>
      <description>I’ve always been suspicious of the idea of being attached to a company.
It could be because of the leftist spirit of my generation in France, or because of my readings during my student years, or because of my familial history (which saw way more self-employed, farmers, nurses or teachers than company employees), but I’ve never accepted the idea of giving even a tiny portion of my independence of mind to a company.</description>

      <description>Ran into a problem with properly activating a WPF when launching from Explorer and indirectly trying to activate an already running instance &amp;#39;from within itself&amp;#39;. It seems simple, but windows focus-stealing restrictions can cause problems with actually getting focus into an application window. Here&amp;#39;s how.</description>

      <title>Differential Analyzer</title>
      <link>https://sinclairtarget.com/differential-analyzer/</link>
      <description>The differential analyzer was an analog computer invented between
        1928 and 1931 by Vannevar Bush, then a professor of engineering at MIT.
        The machine was built to solve differential equations, which are often
        used in engineering and physics to model the behavior of dynamic
        systems. Some kinds of differential equation are trivial to solve, but
        most others are so complex that it is hard to even express their
        solutions in concrete mathematical terms.</description>
