      <title>New Signals Proposal Seeks to Formalize Reactive Programming Primitives in JavaScript </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/06/javascript-signals-proposal/</link>
      <description>The JavaScript language recently added the Signals proposal (currently in Stage 1) to the list of candidate features striving to improve the language. The Signals proposal seeks to provide common primitives primarily for framework maintainers to implement reactive programming patterns. It reflects input from authors/maintainers of Angular, Ember, MobX, Preact, Qwik, RxJS, Solid, Svelte, Vue.</description>

      <title>Why Do Electronic Components Have Such Odd Values? – Digilent Blog</title>
      <link>https://digilent.com/blog/why-do-electronic-components-have-such-odd-values/</link>
      <description>If you’ve been around electronics for a while, you’ve probably noticed that components like resistors, capacitors, zener diodes, and inductors come in some odd values. Looking at the chart below, there seems to be no clear rationale&amp;#160;behind the values, but there is a pattern. 47kΩ resistors and 22μF capacitors are everywhere, but not 40kΩ or 50kΩ resistors, or 20μF or 30μF capacitors. So what’s the deal? It all has to do with preferred numbers.</description>

      <description>People often ask me, how am I able to read and share so many articles and videos. I use RSS for more than 16 years since the days of Google Reader and until now I have not found a better way to access the internet. Social network tried but went broke pretty fast with algorithms and not chronological timelines.</description>

      <title>My simple theory on why we stopped building beautiful buildings (and why many other things suck more than you’d expect) – Daniel Frank</title>
      <link>https://danfrank.ca/my-simple-theory-on-why-we-stopped-building-beautiful-buildings-and-why-many-other-things-suck-more-than-youd-expect/</link>
      <description>I recently read a post on Marginal Revolution discussing why we stopped building beautiful buildings. I have a very simple theory that I think explains part of why we stopped building beautiful buildings, and why many other things are much worse than you’d otherwise expect, despite our tremendous wealth.</description>

      <title>Chorex: Guaranteeing Deadlock Freedom in Elixir</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-06-03_chorex_0_1/</link>
      <description>Chorex is a brand-new Elixir library for choreographic programming [3]: Chorex provides a macro-based DSL that lets you describe how processes communicate to perform a computation. This top-down description of interacting processes is called a choreography. From this choreography, Chorex creates modules for each process that handle all the message-passing in the system. The interactions performed by the generated code will never deadlock by construction because the choreographic DSL ensures that no processes will be waiting on each other at the same time.</description>

      <description>There are two types of knowledge: knowledge of ‘that’ and knowledge of ‘how’. The first is called declarative knowledge, which is concerned with facts. The latter is called procedural knowledge, which is concerned with how to perform a task. Knowing what the capital of Australia is declarative knowledge and knowing how to coding is procedural knowledge.</description>
