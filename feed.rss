To validate the result produced by the API, developers mainly use an external tool</description>

      <title>The Gemini protocol seen by this HTTP client person</title>
      <link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/05/28/the-gemini-protocol-seen-by-this-http-client-person/</link>
      <description>There is again a pull-request submitted to the curl project to bring support for the Gemini protocol. It seems like a worthwhile effort that I support, even if it is also a lot of work involved and it might take some time before it reaches the state in which it can be merged. A previous attempt at doing this was abandoned a while ago.</description>

      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/azure-sql-triggers-for-azure-functions/</link>
      <description>This post is about Azure SQL trigger for Azure Functions. The Azure SQL trigger uses SQL change tracking functionality to monitor a SQL table for changes and trigger a function when a row is created, updated, or deleted. Changes are processed in the order that their changes were made, with the oldest changes being processed first. Currently SQL trigger is not available as part of Visual Studio new function screen. We need to create an Azure function and modify code to support Sql triggers.</description>
