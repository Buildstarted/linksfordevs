      <title>Datetime Made Easy with This ONE C# Dapper Trick!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=84pgpQAHv2k</link>
      <description>DateTime, DateTimeOffset, and... well, ANYTHING with dates, times, and time zones can be a huge pain in the butt in DotNet.

DateTimeOffset has made some of this stuff feel much better in our applications because it can carry around with it the time zone offset along with the DateTime itself. Awesome!

But have you found in your applications that you&amp;#39;re writing UTC DateTimes to databases and then reading those DateTimes back?

If you&amp;#39;re not careful, you&amp;#39;ll lose the implicit UTC time zone information. But there&amp;#39;s a handy trick we can use with Dapper as we&amp;#39;ll see in this tutorial!

      <description>Blazor is a solid framework in the #dotnet ecosystem that enables us to create robust web applications. I especially like the approach to SSR taken by the Blazor team. I wanted to showcase its power and I tried to write from scratch 3 Blazor apps in 30 minutes. Did I succeed?

      <title>3 Things That CATAPULTED My Software Engineering Journey</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=oWO2jn_Nrug</link>
      <description>Reflecting on our journeys isn&amp;#39;t always about learning from failures...

Sometimes things actually worked REALLY well!

In this video, I wanted to share three things that I think worked really well for me in my software engineering journey.

Remember: everyone will have their own journey. Just because these worked well for me doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you need to mirror them.

      <title>Superhuman Speech</title>
      <link>https://www.zachocean.com/posts/superhuman-speech/</link>
      <description>Sometimes it feels like superhuman text to speech (and generative audio in general) is solved.
But it’s not—even though TTS models are close or even superior to average humans in tasks like audiobook narration, they’re still way worse than the best humans in most speech domains.
What follows is a collection of links that I believe represent the highest level of human speech generation.
This list was made off the top of my head in just a few minutes, so please send me more that come to mind.</description>

      <title>What I Learned Scaling Transformer Models at Cohere</title>
      <link>https://vgpu.io/blog/transformer-scaling-at-cohere/</link>
      <description>&amp;#128075; Introduction
Hello, I&amp;#39;m Arthur Rasmusson. I&amp;#39;ve contributed to open-source projects for GPU virtualization at LibVF.IO and Open-IOV.org. In 2023, I joined Cohere&amp;#39;s model efficiency team. Over the past year, I dedicated myself to projects aimed at enhancing our GPU cluster for AI inference capabilities and large-scale machine learning tasks.
This is the story of my journey at Cohere, from initiating the GPUDirect Storage project to defining new standard bars for efficiency and power in GPU &amp;amp; AI infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Tips for creating merge commits</title>
      <link>https://www.brandonpugh.com/blog/tips-for-creating-merge-commits/</link>
      <description>I’ve reviewed quite a few pull requests in recent years and I’ve noticed some less-than-ideal practices when it comes to creating merge commits so I thought I’d list some things you can do to make life a little easier for someone reviewing your code.
Make the commit message as useful as possible A lot has been written about how to write good commit messages, but I rarely see the advice applied to merge commits.</description>

      <title>Using an 8K TV as a monitor</title>
      <link>https://daniel.lawrence.lu/blog/y2023m12d15/</link>
      <description>For programming, word processing, and other productive work, consider getting an 8K TV instead of a multi-monitor setup.
An 8K TV will have superior image quality, resolution, and versatility compared to multiple 4K displays, at roughly the same size.
As a bonus, an 8K display is also suitable for gaming at 4K 120 Hz, or for full screen media consumption, which is not possible with multiple smaller monitors.</description>

      <title>Avoiding boilerplate and architecture erosion with Metalama</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=x7IZ2skLYoQ</link>
      <description>Explore the challenges of boilerplate code in large C# codebases and the complexities of architecture erosion with Gael Fraiteur, the mind behind PostSharp and Metalama.

In this talk, we will discuss how meta-programming can help address code repetition and quality.

We will see how aspects can encapsulate concerns that cannot be handled by traditional object-oriented programming, thereby reducing boilerplate code.

You will also learn how to validate your code against architecture rules in real-time, directly from the IDE, which can help prevent architecture erosion.

The goal of this talk is to broaden your software development horizon. Attend if you want to improve your ability to deliver clean, concise, and maintainable code.
