      <title>A billion deaths at two degrees? Why climate activists should make a special effort to get the science right - Mark Lynas</title>

      <description>The world owes a great debt to Extinction Rebellion. XR&amp;#39;s heyday protests in London helped deliver a UK net zero commitment, forcing many other countries to adopt similar targets. XR has already changed the world - if governments stick to these targets, we have a significantly higher chance of avoiding climate catastrophe and many lives</description>

      <title>Not Always the Best Idea – view source</title>
      <link>https://viewsrc.blog/2023/10/21/no-stored-procedures/</link>
      <description>In the context of data engineering we have our share of foot guns. One of those foot guns that I run into the most are stored procedures and views. In a team data engineering environment their nature is not conducive to effective work.</description>

      <title>Integrating dynamic binaries in macOS apps - Alin Panaitiu</title>
      <link>https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Integrating-dynamic-binaries-in-macOS-apps</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s morning, 8:01am. A bit cold, as the fire has long stopped burning in the fireplace and the stone has lost its heat. Cora, the dog, is sleeping alone on the floor. Belly up as well, she seems to enjoy the cold. My wife is still snoozing so I have to carefully choose my activities if I want to avoid her angry “why aren’t you sleeping” stare. I choose the only silent activity, I grab my phone and stare at the lockscreen. Ten (10) notifications (in order of appearance): ...</description>

      <title>Iterating on a business idea</title>
      <link>http://www.adambourg.com/software/business/startups/2023/10/20/Iterating-on-a-business-idea.html</link>
      <description>I’m a man of many, many, many ideas. I have a long list and a variety of interests. I’ve always wanted to start and more importantly run a successful small business. To build a product, get it to market and run with it. I’ve been apart of a few consultancy companies and a few unsuccessful start ups.</description>

      <title>People Can&amp;#39;t Care About Everything</title>
      <link>https://erikmcclure.com/blog/people-cant-care-about-everything/</link>
      <description>I originally posted an even more snarky response to this, but later deleted it when I realized they were just a teenager. Kids do not have decades of experience with buggy drivers, infuriating edge-cases, and broken promises necessary to understand and contribute to the underlying debate here (nor do they have the social context to know that Xe and I were just joking with each other). Of course, they also don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s generally considered poor taste to interject like this, as it tends to annoy everyone and almost always fails to take into consideration the greater context in which someone might be using Windows, or Mac, or TikTok, or Twitter, or whatever corporate hellscape they are trapped in.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of LLM-Powered personal assistants: pioneering a new platform economy</title>
      <link>https://blog.owulveryck.info/2023/10/16/the-dawn-of-llm-powered-personal-assistants-pioneering-a-new-platform-economy.html</link>
      <description>The article delves into the evolving platform economy where digital platforms, such as ChatGPT powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), serve as intermediaries connecting stakeholders. These platforms, unlike traditional pipelines, leverage digital technology to create value through mass personalized interactions.
Using a hypothetical use-case, the article demonstrates how ChatGPT can be an intuitive personal assistant, bridging users with various service providers.
However, with the rise of such platforms, challenges akin to SEO in search engines are anticipated.
Approaches like Prompt Engineering and Automatic Choice Optimization will become pivotal.
Lastly, a critical challenge for providers is to be chosen by AI systems in a landscape dominated by a few digital giants.
