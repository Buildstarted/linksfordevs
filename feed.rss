      <title>Llama&amp;#39;s Legal Labyrinth</title>
      <link>https://merlijn.sebrechts.be/blog/2024-08-06-problematic-meta-llama-3-1-license/</link>
      <description>Meta just introduced the Llama 3.1 AI model and accompanied the launch with a blog post explaining “Open Source AI is the path forward” [a]. But buyer beware: Llama 3.1 itself is a legal labyrinth.
Despite what Meta is implying, Llama 3.1 is not open source. The model is licensed under the Llama 3.1 license and the Llama 3.1 acceptable use policy. These heavily restrict who can use the model and for what purpose.</description>

      <description>Have you noticed that the technology of the world is rapidly growing, we went from horses and buggies in 1890s to super sonic jet airplanes by the 1970s. Since 1970 we’ve seen a massive increase of technology from airplanes, cars, the internet and medicine. We’ve got vaccines based off of custom engineered MRNA strands to kill viruses-how neat is that!</description>

      <title>You don&amp;#39;t need NordVPN (if you have SSH) &amp;#183;</title>
      <link>https://blog.lasne.pro/posts/bypass_country_restrictions_with_ssh/</link>
      <description>Let’s say, hypothetically, you want to see the replay of Teddy Riner kicking ass at the Olympics.
But you’re not in France, so France TV blocks you if your IP is not French.
Your operator locates you in an area where this video is not available (Denmark).
At this point, you might think about taking a VPN subscription or find a free shaddy VPN that will inject malware into unencrypted HTTP pages.</description>

      <title>Ten years of this site</title>
      <link>https://www.clintonboys.com/ten-years/</link>
      <description>In August 2014, during my transition from studying mathematics in Sydney to working in tech in Tel Aviv, I deployed the first version of my personal website. The site looked pretty similar ten years ago to how it looked yesterday, the main difference being that every post had a photograph at the top, of some different part of the world I had travelled to. These photos were quite nice, and a little differentiating feature from other bland text-based personal websites of tech folks, but at some point around five years ago, I decided to conform to the unwritten international bland text-based personal website standard, and removed the images, justifying it with my desire for a minimalist aesthetic, and improved loading times.

      <link>https://ashdnazg.github.io/articles/24/Solving-Super-Six</link>
      <description>Super Six (a.k.a Rio and plenty of other names) is not a good game, it’s repetitive, heavily luck dependent, and repetitive. Nevertheless, it has two major qualities - it’s short and simple. These qualities translate into a much more interesting one - it’s solvable for two players! While the game itself is a mediocre subject for a blog post, the maths behind solving it are not only interesting themselves, but they can also be used to solve other two-player games.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Model in LLVM - Part I</title>
      <link>https://myhsu.xyz/llvm-sched-model-1/</link>
      <description>Instruction scheduling is essential to modern compilers. It tries to hide latencies and increases the throughput of a straight line code by reordering the enclosing instructions. In order to do that, compilers have to know a whole bunch of information, ranging from individal instruction’s latency to microarchitecture details. The system that describes these is called a scheduling model. In LLVM, a scheduling model is used by not just the instruction scheduler, but also target-specific optimizations like MachineCombiner and components like MCA (Machine Code Analyzer)1.</description>
