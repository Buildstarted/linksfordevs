      <title>20 Years of WordPress &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/wordpress-20th/</link>
      <description>In the early days, the web had many beautiful, romantic phases, in which things were simpler and people online, less prone to aggression, more innocent and/or prone to the good things in life.
In the early 2000s, the technical side of the web was also going through an interesting moment. Suddenly, sites went from being static to becoming dynamic.
Among the many systems of that period, on May 27th 2003, a small CMS for blogs called WordPress appeared.</description>

      <title>Extreme Bevy: Making a p2p web game with rust and rollback netcode</title>
      <link>https://johanhelsing.studio/posts/extreme-bevy</link>
      <description>In my previous post, Introducing Matchbox, I explained how Matchbox solves the problem of setting up peer-to-peer connections in rust web assembly for implementing low-latency multiplayer web games. I said I&amp;#39;d start making games using it and I figured it&amp;#39;s about time I make good on that promise, as well as write a tutorial while at it. I&amp;#39;ll explain step-by-step how to use Bevy, GGRS, and Matchbox to recreate the old classic Extreme Violence by Simon Green with online p2p multiplayer using rollback netcode.</description>
