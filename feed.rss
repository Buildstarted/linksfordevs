      <title>Unit testing and mocking with Azure SDK .NET | Azure SDK Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/unit-testing-and-mocking/</link>
      <description>Unit testing is an important part of a sustainable development process because it enables developers to prevent regressions. Things get complicated when the code you are testing communicates with an Azure service over a network. How can you reliably test code with external dependencies?</description>

      <title>Data Deficient Messages</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/data-deficient-messages/</link>
      <description>In distributed applications and microservices that send events or notifications to other apps or services, take care to include sufficient information in the messages themselves. Failure to do so will likely result in downstream services needing to call back to request additional details. This can result in a flood of incoming requests responding to each message, essentially denial-of-service attacking the source app.</description>

I have selected most of the text, and on the right side you can see two copy&amp;amp;paste results. In the upper half is the result directly after scanning, right after the bundled ABBYY FineReader that comes with the iX500 did its magic. In the lower half is the result after modifying (removed a blank page) and saving that same PDF in Preview.</description>

      <title>AIR-FI: Generating Covert Wi-Fi Signals from Air-Gapped Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06884</link>
      <description>In this paper, we show that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped
computers via Wi-Fi signals. Malware in a compromised air-gapped computer can
generate signals in the Wi-Fi frequency bands. The signals are generated
through the memory buses - no special hardware is required. Sensitive data can
be modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that
nearby Wi-Fi capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) can
intercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the
Internet. To extract the signals, we utilize the physical layer information
exposed by the Wi-Fi chips. We implement the transmitter and receiver and
discuss design considerations and implementation details. We evaluate this
covert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and present a set of
countermeasures. Our evaluation shows that data can be exfiltrated from
air-gapped computers to nearby Wi-Fi receivers located a distance of several
meters away.</description>

      <description>There are many concerns about Mozilla right now, and reason to be concerned. While I am no longer with Mozilla, it’s still a place that supported me for many years; I believe in Mozilla and want the project to&amp;#160;succeed.</description>

      <title>Why does PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED return false even when virtualization is enabled in the firmware? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201216-00/?p=104550</link>
      <description>The Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present function has a processor feature called PF_VIRT_FIRMWARE_ENABLED. A customer enabled virtualization in their firmware, but calling Is&amp;#173;Processor&amp;#173;Feature&amp;#173;Present with that feature still returned FALSE. Why is this function lying? It’s not lying. Even if you enable virtualization in firmware, it may not actually be available.</description>
