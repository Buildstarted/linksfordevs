      <title>Get the location of the ISS using DNS</title>
      <link>https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/get-the-location-of-the-iss-using-dns/</link>
      <description>I love DNS esoterica. Weird little things that you can shove in the global directory to be distributed around the world instantly(ish).  Domain names, like www.example.com usually resolve to servers. As much as we think of "the cloud" as being some intangible morass of ethereal Turing-machines floating in probability space, the more prosaic reality is that they're just boxen in data centres. They ‚Ä¶</description>

      <link>https://mht.wtf/post/aicohol/</link>
      <description>The ethics1 of LLMs is a contentious topic.
I think this is mainly because of the current reach of the technology (it's everywhere),
the hype (people claim it can do anything),
and that it's succesful (it's hard to ignore).
Unfortunately, a lot of things are mixed into disussions around the ethics of LLMs,
and so I've struggeled with figuring out what I think.</description>

      <title>Two And A Half Years In GameDev</title>
      <link>https://smyachenkov.com/posts/two-and-half-years-in-gamedev/</link>
      <description>About 3 years ago, I joined a GameDev company, without any prior experience making games or hands-on exposure to this industry.
Statistically, this time is not even enough to release a single game. But during that window, I was lucky to meet many talented people deeply involved in modern GameDev, who shared with me their career journeys, war tales, and anecdotes, and helped me shape my vision.
One unexpected outcome of this switch was that many friends and former colleagues reached out to me curious about what it was like and how it is comparable to my previous experiences. A surprising amount of them revealed to me that they were secretly planning to pursue this path later in their career, or explore it as a passion project.</description>

      <title>üí£Making Explainable Minesweeper</title>
      <link>https://sublevelgames.github.io/blogs/2025-07-06-making-explainable-minesweeper/</link>
      <description>Many Minesweeper situations that seem like 50/50 luck are actually solvable through logical deduction. Inspired by ‚Äò14 Minesweeper Variants,‚Äô I created ‚ÄòExplainable Minesweeper‚Äô - a game that generates only logically solvable puzzles and explains the reasoning in natural language.</description>
