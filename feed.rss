      <title>Tutorial: Build gRPC &amp;amp; OData in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/odata/tutorial-build-grpc-odata-in-asp-net-core/</link>
      <description>Introduction gRPC (google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance remote procedure call framework that helps developers to build and consume remote services using the same way as calling local APIs. Different from gRPC, OData (Open Data Protocol) is an&amp;#160;OASIS standard&amp;#160;that defines a set of best practices for developers to build and consume RESTful APIs using HTTP request/response.</description>

      <title>A File Format to Aid in Security Vulnerability Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116</link>
      <description>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by
researchers, proper reporting channels are often lacking. As a result,
vulnerabilities may be left unreported. This document defines a machine-parsable format
(&amp;quot;security.txt&amp;quot;) to help organizations describe their vulnerability disclosure practices
to make it easier for researchers to report vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language, and consists of a core compiler, together with extensions, kits and other resources, a number of outlying tools, and documentation, along with applications presenting the system in a friendly way on MacOS, Windows and Linux. This software had been used extensively since 28 April 2006, but by 2016 its source code was in considerable need of modernisation. In part that was wear-and-tear, but it was also the effect of year...</description>

      <title>2022 Mac Studio (20-core M1 Ultra) Review</title>
      <link>http://hrtapps.com/blogs/20220427/</link>
      <description>I do a lot of writing as an engineer, but it’s technical writing.  It’s all about documenting facts and data in a direct manner, in tables and charts, without much emotion or creativity.  So when I get to review new        
pro 
Macs, I always look for some sort of inspiration, some sort of creative hook that leads me to an interesting theme.  With the Mac Studio Ultra, the theme was direct and turned out to be technical after all: this 8x8x4&amp;quot; supercomputer is off the charts. More on that in a bit.</description>

      <title>Real World Cryptography Conference 2022</title>
      <link>https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/04/26/real-world-cryptography-conference-2022/</link>
      <description>The IACR’s annual Real World Cryptography (RWC) conference took place in Amsterdam a few weeks ago. It remains the best venue for highlights of cryptographic constructions and attacks for the real world. While the conference was fully remote last year, this year it was a 3-day hybrid event, live-streamed from a conference center in charming central Amsterdam with an audience of about 500 cryptographers.

Some members of our Cryptography Services team attended in person, while others shifted their schedules by six hours to watch the talks live online. In this post, we share summaries of some of our favorite talks. Have a stroopwafel and enjoy!</description>
