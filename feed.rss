      <title>Wave Curves: Simulating Lagrangian water waves on dynamically deforming surfaces (SIGGRAPH 2020)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7SqHnfV8rI</link>
      <description>This is the video accompanying the SIGGRAPH 2020 paper "Wave Curves: Simulating Lagrangian water waves on dynamically deforming surfaces" by Tomáš Skřivan, Andreas Söderström, John Johansson, Christoph Sprenger, Ken Museth, Chris Wojtan.

Project page: https://visualcomputing.ist.ac.at/publications/2020/WaveCurves/

Abstract:
We propose a method to enhance the visual detail of a water surface simulation. Our method works as a post-processing step which takes a simulation as input and increases its apparent resolution by simulating many detailed Lagrangian water waves on top of it. We extend linear water wave theory to work in non-planar domains which deform over time, and we discretize the theory using Lagrangian wave packets attached to spline curves. The method is numerically stable and trivially parallelizable, and it produces high frequency ripples with dispersive wave-like behaviors customized to the underlying fluid simulation.</description>

      <description>Before, I was a train wreck that ate too many cinnamon rolls and watched Netflix while laying in sweats on the couch. Today, I ran 3 miles, did 40 minutes of yoga, meditated, ate steel cut oats with berries for breakfast, then turned on my favorite business podcast while I showered, all before work.</description>

      <title>Why is Artificial Intelligence So Useless for Business?</title>
      <link>https://mebassett.info/ai-useless-for-business</link>
      <description>Today's work in artificial intelligence is amazing.
We've taught computers to beat the most advanced players in the most
complex games.
We've taught them to drive cars and create photo-realistic videos and
images of people.
They can re-create works of fine-art and emulate the best writers.
Yet I know that many businesses still need people to, e.g., read PDF
documents about an office building and write down the sizes of the
leasable units contained therein.
If artificial intelligence can do all that, why can't it read a PDF
document and transform it into a machine-readable format?
Today's artificial intelligence algorithms can recreate playable
versions of Pacman just from playing games against itself 1.
So why can't I get a computer to translate my colleague's financial
spreadsheet into the format my SAP software wants?</description>
