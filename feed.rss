      <description>Over recent months, tech companies have been laying workers off by the thousands. It is estimated that in 2022 alone, over 120,000 people have been dismissed from their job at some of the biggest players in tech — Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and soon Google — and smaller firms and startups as well. Announcements of cuts keep coming.</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Basics: Roles and Privileges - Simple Talk</title>
      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/postgresql/postgresql-basics-roles-and-privileges/</link>
      <description>Information security, whether in databases, applications, or larger IT systems, is based on the principles of Authentication and Authorization, often referred to as AuthN and AuthZ respectively.   Likewise, PostgreSQL security involves creating roles that allow access to server resources (AuthN) and then granting privileges to database objects appropriately (AuthZ). Understanding how each of these components work together is essential to effectively manage security in a PostgreSQL cluster.</description>

      <link>https://json.blog/2023/01/21/delimited-files-are.html</link>
      <description>Here’s a real live example of why I am stuck with R and stuck with data.table. In my work, I often receive various delimited files from customers. Mostly, these delimited files are created from Oracle or MS SQL and have all kinds of gnarly things going on. Without sharing too much, here’s a partial example of the last few fields of one line in one of those files:

      <description>Good advice is very difficult to give. This is because it is inherently context dependent. Advice is inextricably linked with the lived experience of the person giving the advice. No matter how well conceived or written, the value of advice is limited by its applicability to a given situation.</description>
