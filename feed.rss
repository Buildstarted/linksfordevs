      <title>Replacing Zoom with Open Broadcaster Software</title>
      <link>https://rgoswami.me/posts/rep-zoom-obs/</link>
      <description>A post on local recordings
 Background Since the advent of the COVID-19 situation, there has been an increase in the demand for recorded materials. Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.
  Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement
  At this point, given that I was to set up a pre-recorded video for PyCon India 2020, I decided to look into alternatives.</description>

      <title>SLOs for Open Source</title>
      <link>https://mjpitz.com/blog/2020/09/30/slos-for-oss/</link>
      <description>Open source software has been used to build organizations for years.
From libraries to complex infrastructure systems, the open source landscape provides a vast sea of solutions.
For larger infrastructure projects, organizations are asking maintainers for service level objectives (SLOs).
Many do not publish or provide any, even when projects come from organizations who likely had SLOs in place.
In this post, I walk through my process for developing indicators and objectives for open source projects.</description>

      <description>India government is reportedly planning to develop its own App Store to end the duopoly of the mobile ecosystem by Google and Apple. In recent weeks, several start-ups and app-makers have been voicing concern over Google&amp;#39;s policy, which made it mandatory for all developers to give 30% commission for all billings on apps registered on the Play store. Even some popular apps such as Zomato and Swiggy were also sent a notice for violation of store policy. Even Paytm was suspended for several hours and only after complying with Google&amp;#39;s policy, was restored.</description>
