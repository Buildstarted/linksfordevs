      <title>Work on interesting problems. Not interesting technologies - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://ruky.me/2021/09/15/work-on-interesting-problems-not-interesting-technologies-part-2/</link>
      <description>Recently I wrote a short post about why you should work on interesting problems instead of interesting technologies. I never thought that it would reach front page on HN and receive so many responses. 



Since I wrote that post in a hurry, I think there are some points that I missed, and some clari</description>

      <title>Syntax highlighting is backwards</title>
      <link>https://www.benkuhn.net/syntax/</link>
      <description>Most code editors color different pieces of your program in different ways. For instance, they’ll make keywords like if bold and bright so that you notice when you’ve misspelled them. They’ll make non-executable parts like comments and documentation fainter so that you know that the computer isn’t seeing that part of the program. But isn’t that exactly backwards?</description>

      <title>advanced shell packaging: resholve YADM&amp;#39;s nixpkg</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been working on resholve to improve Nix packaging for shell projects since early 2020, but the new v0.6.0 release is a decent leap forward in the fraction of Shell scripts and programs resholve can handle.</description>

      <link>https://xtdb.com/articles/strength-of-the-record.html</link>
      <description>The computer is a curious gadget. It is one of few human inventions which can exist purely — yet accurately — in the imagination. Prior to the existence of a real computing machine, mathematicians could hypothesize how it might behave. They even understood the unbounded, fractal potential of computers: If human beings have machines for computation we also have the atom of computation and we can recombine these atoms to great effect. Our largest and most complex computers were borne of tiny, simple computing components.</description>

      <title>How We Made Playable Quotes for the Game Boy</title>
      <link>https://joel.franusic.com/playable_quotes_for_game_boy</link>
      <description>Imagine there’s a specific moment in a Game Boy game that you want to share with a friend. You could share a screenshot or a video, but that’s not the same as letting your friend grab the controls and try it for themselves. Many Game Boy emulators have a notion of a save state file, but in order for your friend to use one of these, they need to have access to the original game. It would be overkill (and likely illegal) to post the entire original game just so that your friend can play for a few seconds. What if you could share a playable quote from the game in the way that you can share readable quotes by just copy-pasting the specific text you want?</description>

      <title>Go&amp;#39;ing Insane Part One: Endless Error Handling</title>
      <link>https://jesseduffield.com/Gos-Shortcomings-1/</link>
      <description>I’ve been using Go for a few years now, mostly in my open source project Lazygit. In my day job I use Ruby and Typescript, and I’ve also spent some time with Rust. Each of those languages have design quirks that can grind a developer’s gears, and although my own precious gears have been ground by every language I’ve used, Go is the only language that has made me feel indignant.

      <title>Should Controllers Reference Repositories or Services</title>
      <link>https://ardalis.com/should-controllers-reference-repositories-services/</link>

      <description>We have a lot of work to do in the tech industry to create inclusive work environments at scale.
