      <title>Why don’t we do more prescribed burning? An explainer. - Kevin Drum</title>

      <description>Prescribed fires—or the lack of them—are on everybody&amp;#39;s lip these days. Most people are just parroting talking points for political purposes, but perhaps you&amp;#39;d actually like to be a little smarter about it? Sure you would. It&amp;#39;s a weekend and you have some spare time. So let&amp;#39;s go through some history and then some current events. It&amp;#39;s a little long…</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming from Scratch</title>
      <link>https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/</link>
      <description>Differentiable programming has become a hot research topic, and not only due to the popularity of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Many fields apart from machine learning are finding differentiable programming to be a useful tool for solving optimization problems. In computer graphics, differentiable rendering, differentiable physics, and neural representations are all gaining popularity.</description>

      <title>Cosine Similarity: Not the Silver Bullet We Thought It Was | Shaped Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.shaped.ai/blog/cosine-similarity-not-the-silver-bullet-we-thought-it-was</link>
      <description>In the world of machine learning and data science, cosine similarity has long been a go-to metric for measuring the semantic similarity between high-dimensional objects. However, a new study by researchers at Netflix and Cornell University challenges our understanding of this popular technique, exposing the underlying issues that could lead to arbitrary and meaningless results. This is particularly concerning for recommendation systems and other AI models that rely on cosine similarity to quantify semantic similarity. As Netflix continues to innovate in enhancing user experiences, understanding these limitations is essential for refining algorithms to deliver more accurate and reliable insights, ultimately improving user engagement and satisfaction.</description>

      <link>https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/10/dev-experience.html</link>
      <description>The field of LLM inference is advancing at an unprecedented pace. With new models and features emerging weekly, the traditional software release pipeline often struggles to keep up. At vLLM, we aim to provide more than just a software package. We’re building a system—a trusted, trackable, and participatory ecosystem for LLM inference. This blog post highlights how vLLM enables users to install and develop with ease while staying at the forefront of innovation.</description>

      <title>David A. Wheeler&amp;#39;s Review of &amp;quot;Debugging&amp;quot; by David J. Agans</title>
      <link>https://dwheeler.com/essays/debugging-agans.html</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s not often you find a classic, but I think I&amp;#39;ve found
a new classic for software and computer hardware developers.
It&amp;#39;s David J. Agan&amp;#39;s
Debugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding
Even the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems
(ISBN 0814471684).
This book explains the fundamentals of finding and fixing bugs
(once a bug has been detected), rather than any particular technology.
It&amp;#39;s best for developers who are novices or who are only moderately
experienced, but even old pros will find helpful reminders of things they
know they should do but forget in the rush of the moment.
This book will help you fix those inevitable bugs,
particularly if you&amp;#39;re not a pro at debugging.
It&amp;#39;s hard to bottle experience; this book does a good job.
This is a book I expect to find useful many, many, years from now.</description>

      <title>Equipping 3rd party types with debugging capabilities</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/48d50101-fa20-4f26-9a59-5c1229302460</link>
      <description>Debugging is important, and it&amp;#39;s often useful to be able to inspect the state of objects in the debugger.
However sometimes you&amp;#39;re working with 3rd party types that don&amp;#39;t have any debugging capabilities, so you can&amp;#39;t see their internal state easily. In this blog post we will have a look on how to equip 3rd party types with debugging capabilities.

      <description>Intelligent agents are considered by many to be the ultimate goal of AI. The classic book by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Prentice Hall, 1995), defines the field of AI research as “the study and design of rational agents.”</description>

      <title>Why some DVLA digital services don&amp;#39;t work at night</title>
      <link>https://dafyddvaughan.uk/blog/2025/why-some-dvla-digital-services-dont-work-at-night/</link>
      <description>Every few months or so, somebody asks on social media why a particular DVLA digital service is turned off over night. Rather than answering it every time, I’ve decided to write this post, so I can point people at it in future. It’s a great case study to show why making government services digitally native can be quite complicated.</description>

      <title>Uv has a killer feature you should know about</title>
      <link>https://valatka.dev/2025/01/12/on-killer-uv-feature.html</link>
      <description>In my view, neither performance nor trying to be Python-aligned is what sets uv apart. Don’t get me wrong — try switching from uv to Poetry, and you’ll quickly notice how sluggish it (poetry) feels. uv goes extra miles to adhere to PEPs, and IMHO it’s the go-to package manager for Python these days. But these aren’t the features that surprised me most.</description>
