      <title>Navigating the Future of AI: Strategies for Survival</title>
      <link>https://dzidas.com/ml/2023/03/19/chatgtp-eats-the-world/</link>
      <description>Lately, reading the news and following updates about advancements in AI, specifically in Generative AI and chatGPT, gave me mixed feelings - on one hand, we are on something big and impactful, but at the same time it feels like a potential threat to the future. And I’m not alone - NLP students lost their field of research overnight, meanwhile some orgs at FAANG became obsolete. It is an old news that chatGPT can pass a software developer tests at FAANG, an exam to become a lawyer or generate inspirational phrases for your YouTube shorts. But I’m sceptical that we will experience a radical transformation in a short time of a few years, but rather, it will be an iterative change which can take a decade or more. But as a story goes, a slowly boiled frog was too comfortable to jump out of a pot, the fate we shall avoid.</description>

      <description>If you are reading this article, you are most likely using a web browser, and you have some expectations or beliefs about online privacy and security. For example, I do not know what you are reading on other tabs on your web browser, and you would like to keep it that way. But the websites themselves know that you are reading a particular page on their website. They most likely know your IP address and if you are signed in to their website, they also know your identity. This is not unreasonable because you chose to identify yourself in exchange for certain services. That’s how web works.</description>
