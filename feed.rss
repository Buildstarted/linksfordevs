      <title>Why do companies that sell APIs have such low churn rates?</title>
      <link>https://matt-rickard.com/api-company-churn-rates/</link>
      <description>You would expect otherwise. An API is a stationary target - stability is a key value driver. It has well-defined inputs and outputs (which are not IP according to the Supreme Court). In theory, this makes it an easy target for competitors to offer a drop in replacement.  Yet, companies</description>

I will not be discussing &amp;quot;how to build MVP&amp;quot; part because that&amp;#39;d be a waste of time for everybody. I&amp;#39;ve validated multiple products on Reddit and built one of them.

      <title>GCC drops its copyright-assignment requirement</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/857791/</link>
      <description>The GCC compiler, like other GNU projects, has long required contributors
to complete paperwork assigning the copyrights on their work to the Free
Software Foundation.  That requirement has just been dropped, and
contributors can now attach a Signed-off-by tag indicating use of the
Developers Certificate of
Origin instead.  &amp;quot;This change is consistent with
the practices of many other major Free Software projects, such as the
Linux kernel.&amp;quot;  Initial discussion
suggests that some developers 
were surprised by this change and are yet to be convinced that it is a good
idea.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/conversation-about-net-interop/</link>
      <description>Interop is the subsystem in the runtime that enables interoperability with other systems, like native C libraries or Objective-C. In some cases, it includes a full interop implementation like via P/Invoke or COM interop. In other cases, like for WinRT, it provides the building block APIs such that another (external) component can provide an end-to-end implementation.</description>

      <description>I just finished the writing part of the new edition of the Developer Advocacy Handbook. I wrote the original almost 15 years ago, and this edition is a heavy re-write. A lot has changed in the world of Developer Advocacy and I tried to add my findings over the last few years to the book. It gives you all the basics of becoming a Developer Advocate and explains which channels to cover and how. I deliberately moved away from favouring certain products or social networks as these things change at a fast pace.</description>
