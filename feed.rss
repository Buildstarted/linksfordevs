      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip344.html</link>
      <description>Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestrator technology that enables you to run a solution with many containers. Azure Arc (opens new window) can make your Kubernetes cluster part of Azure so that you can manage it from Azure, just like an Azure Kubernetes Service (opens new window). And you can use that Kubernetes cluster as compute to run other services, like App Service (opens new window), Event Grid (opens new window), and API Management Gateway (opens new window).</description>

I’ve been focused solely on the non-MS developer experience, which means Python, Ruby, Node, etc. Up until now, I’ve been using Postgres as a database (as one should), but I also know that Mongo DB has a massive following - so I decided to focus on that for this latest experiment, specifically with respect to Node.</description>

      <title>But What About the Bus Factor?</title>
      <link>https://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/but-what-about-the-bus-factor/</link>
      <description>The term “bus factor” refers to the number of project maintainers who, if hit by a bus and incapacitated, would cause that project to stall. You can replace the bus crash with any other form of physical or mental incapacitation or even changes in life circumstances or priorities. The lower the bus factor, the greater the risk that a project might suddenly become unsustainable.
