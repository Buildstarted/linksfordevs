      <title>Modern .NET NuGet Packaging with Scott Harden</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=0QMVaLX8vDc</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;So a lot of these features are new features that probably weren&amp;#39;t there when you first made your package. But I&amp;#39;d like to just briefly talk through what each of these are and talk about how to fix them. So before jumping into the complexity of those red Xs, let&amp;#39;s just take a little step back and talk about how to edit what appears in a NuGet package. Because it might be a little bit confusing for someone who&amp;#39;s brand new.&amp;quot;— Scott Harden

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I&amp;#39;m Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.

 In this episode, Scott Harden joined us for the final part in a special three part series. This final part of our conversation takes the major points from the previous two episodes and applies them specifically to authoring NuGet packages.

 We start by discussing what NuGet packages are, cover the NuGet Package Explorer (which you can run in your browser, by the way), and finally wrap everything up by taking a look at a PR that Scott had provided for one of Jamie&amp;#39;s open-source packages: OWASP Headers.Core.

 &amp;quot;So in this case, it&amp;#39;s like, well, okay, what icon do we use? A lot of developers are like, &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m a programmer. I&amp;#39;m not a graphic designer.&amp;#39; But—I just want to encourage everyone. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter. First of all, no one&amp;#39;s downloading your NuGet package because you&amp;#39;re a graphic designer. Some of the most popular NuGet packages have really, really, really simple icons. And I&amp;#39;m not going to call any by name but it&amp;#39;s kind of a joke where a lot of people make a really simple one-off icon when their project gets small and they kind of feel like they can never change it later because the project got big, so you have a lot of really great projects with really simple icons, so don&amp;#39;t be intimidated by that&amp;quot;— Scott Harden

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <description>Have you heard that having decoupled systems is paramount to dealing with complexity at the heart of software?
Have you also seen companies waste piles of cash and lots of developer time trying to build decoupled systems?
This article might be of your interest, since my goal is to teach you how to build decoupled systems cheaply and using technology that is battle tested and that will keep you in control.</description>

      <title>Reward Hacking in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking/</link>
      <description>Reward hacking occurs when a reinforcement learning (RL) agent exploits flaws or ambiguities in the reward function to achieve high rewards, without genuinely learning or completing the intended task. Reward hacking exists because RL environments are often imperfect, and it is fundamentally challenging to accurately specify a reward function.
With the rise of language models generalizing to a broad spectrum of tasks and RLHF becomes a de facto method for alignment training, reward hacking in RL training of language models has become a critical practical challenge. Instances where the model learns to modify unit tests to pass coding tasks, or where responses contain biases that mimic a user’s preference, are pretty concerning and are likely one of the major blockers for real-world deployment of more autonomous use cases of AI models.</description>
