      <title>This AI Restores Old Photos with Damages AUTOMATICALLY</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVo400nmZfc</link>
      <description>A week ago Microsoft released a new paper called: Bringing Old Photos Back To Life. This is probably the best physical damage restoration for images I've ever seen. It also includes facial enhancement which is really accurate too. A pretty big contribution from Microsoft to the open-source realm.

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep 5: Collections, Generics, and Introducing LINQ</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7Q-OeWKBew</link>
      <description>This is episode 5 of C# with CSharpFritz. Jeff introduces arrays, collections, generics and starts talking about LINQ in this beginner-friendly 'talk radio style' episode.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:20:17 - What's the fastest way of initializing an array with the same value?
00:32:13 - What type are collection elements when you reference them using var?
00:35:51 - Is there an "Add" method for a Queue?
00:42:18 - What is difference between Stack and Queue?
00:43:46 - Can you pick any element from a Queue or Stack? For example from the middle?
00:46:05 - Can you foreach (enumerate) over a Stack?
00:48:20 - Can you peek into the n-Item of a Stack or Queue?
01:11:30 - How is a Dictionary different than the prior example with the file extensions?
01:15:22 - Is it possible to make a generic object with type Object?
01:39:21 - With LINQ, do you prefer two Where clauses or &amp;&amp;?

      <title>Indy Xamarin User Group - The Best Way to Architect Your Xamarin.Forms App</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW_aGvSQ5oQ</link>
      <description>The title of this talk is a lie. There is no one single way to architect an app. If the app works well, is robust for future expansion, and maintainable - it's architected just fine.

You can mess things up though. And then everything is terrible.

So, tune in to this talk to find out about some ways you can go about architecting your Xamarin.Forms app so you don't hate yourself before development of the app is complete.

      <description>With the job hunting season well under way, I thought I would give a list of tips, tricks, and guiding principles I‚Äôve learned from hunting both this season and seasons past.

      <description>Andrew Lock joins us to talk about testing.  We started out by talking about should you test API/MVC controllers?  The discussion then turned into test for messaging, databases, and much more.

Should you unit-test API/MVC controllers in ASP.NET Core?

      <description>I've been trying to make our house and specifically the yard have more of a resort/getaway location feel during this current pandemic situation and the lockdowns that have been in place. Setting up the hot tub area to feel like somewhere else has been on top of the priority list. I've already added some bamboo screening so the next logical step was to add some tiki lights.</description>

      <title>Nate Rose - Innovating on OUR STEM Education [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2eg2L4eCII</link>
      <description>What is an IQ? Why do we take the SATs? How did it end up even being a metric of childhood success? Senior Software Engineer walks through 100 years of modern education and how it has been systematically flawed for underrepresented communities. NSBE Jr. Bay Area takes on this challenge by innovating outside of the parameters of the education system.

My talk challenges the status quo of common core, standardized tests and looks to technologists, innovators and entrepreneurs as a call to action to remodel education for people of color.

Nate Rose is a Senior Software Engineer with a background in DevOps, Data Engineering, and Distributed Cloud Infrastructure Systems. Outside of engineering at Ripple, he does research in neurotechnology, casually overfits ML models and works with building education equity through non-profits like AI4ALL and NSBE.
