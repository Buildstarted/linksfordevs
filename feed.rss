      <title>What If We Could Rebuild Kafka From Scratch?</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/what-if-we-could-rebuild-kafka-from-scratch/</link>
      <description>
The last few days I spent some time digging into the recently announced KIP-1150 ("Diskless Kafka"), as well AutoMQ’s Kafka fork, tightly integrating Apache Kafka and object storage, such as S3. Following the example set by WarpStream, these projects aim to substantially improve the experience of using Kafka in cloud environments, providing better elasticity, drastically reducing cost, and paving the way towards native lakehouse integration.


This got me thinking, if we were to start all over and develop a durable cloud-native event log from scratch—​Kafka.next if you will—​which traits and characteristics would be desirable for this to have? Separating storage and compute and object store support would be table stakes, but what else should be there? Having used Kafka for many years for building event-driven applications as well as for running realtime ETL and change data capture pipelines, here’s my personal wishlist:

      <title>The #1 Pattern You Need To Know When Publishing Events</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=6YwSKMvTgDU</link>
      <description>Hi, I'm James Eastham and it this video I dive into the intricacies of the outbox pattern. Event-driven architectures can seem straightforward, but managing state and publishing events requires careful consideration.

You'll learn about two key methods: the traditional approach involving transactional writes to separate tables, and the modern approach utilizing Amazon DynamoDB streams. I share hands-on code examples and highlight common pitfalls, offering a thorough guide to building resilient event-driven systems. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to ensure reliable state management while publishing events effectively.

      <title>Korea TSPs</title>
      <link>https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/korea/index.html</link>
      <description>We have solved a traveling salesman problem (TSP) to walk to 81,998 bars in South Korea.
The problem was created using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) to build a table of the 3,361,795,003 point-to-point travel times, one for each pair of bar locations.
Our computation produced a tour together with a proof that it is a shortest-possible route to visit all 81,998 stops when measured with the OSRM times.</description>
