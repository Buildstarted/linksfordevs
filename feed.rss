      <title>Searching 1 billion embeddings from disk in 15 ms on a single machine</title>
      <link>https://blog.wilsonl.in/corenn/</link>
      <description>In my last post, I built a semantic map of 4 million Hacker News posts and dived deep into semantic search and AI embeddings. Continuing the fun research and hacking in this space, in this post, I'll deep dive into how vector search works with interactive visualizations (and the interesting theory behind them), the limitations of current approaches, and how I ended up building a vector DB called CoreNN. It's able to search through 1 billion Reddit comment embeddings in 15 ms from a 4.8 TB index on disk—all time is spent embedding the query and fetching results:</description>

      <title>Language model benchmarks only tell half a story</title>
      <link>https://blog.mastykarz.nl/language-model-benchmarks-story/</link>
      <description>When it comes to language models, we tend to look at benchmarks to decide which model is the best to use in our application. But benchmarks only tell half a story. Unless you're building an all-purpose chat application, what you should be actually looking at is how well a model works for your application.</description>

      <title>Verified Dynamic Programming with Σ-types in Lean</title>
      <link>https://tannerduve.github.io/blog/memoization-sigma/</link>
      <description>1. IntroductionIf you’ve taken an algorithms class, you have likely seen dynamic programming, specifically a technique called memoization. Memoization works to optimize recursive algorithms by caching the solutions to subproblems in a table, and when a subproblem is encountered, it queries the table instead of recomputing the solution. This gives us an exponential performance boost.</description>

      <description>I recently set up a phone line for my 9-year-old. Why? I liked the idea of her being able to connect with others in a way she has control over, but with some of the natural limitations built in to a traditional landline and without the distractions of a smartphone. Okay, it also just seemed … Continue reading Setting up a landline phone for kids</description>

      <title>GETting Conditionally - The Bare Basics</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/06/getting-conditionally</link>
      <description>A while ago, a prominent Vercel employee (two, actually) posted to the tune of: Developers don’t get CDNs Exhibit A etc. It is often that random tweets somehow get me into a frenzy – somebody is wrong on the internet, yet again. But when I gave this a second thought, I figured that… this statement has more merit than I would have wanted it to have. It has merit because we do not know the very basics of cache control that are necessary (and there are not that many)! It does not have merit in the sense that force-prefetching all of your includes through Vercel’s magic RSC-combine will not, actually, solve all your problems. They are talking in solutions that they sell, and what they are not emphasizing is that the issue is with the “developer slaps ‘Cache-Control’” part. Moreover: as I will explain, a lot of juice can be squeezed out of you by CDN providers exactly because your cache control is not in order and they offer you tools that kind of “force” your performance back into a survivable state. With some improvement for your users, and to the detriment of your wallet. But first, let’s rewind and see what those CDNs actually do. CDNs use something called “conditional GET requests”. Conditional GET requests mean: Cache-Control. And even I, in my hubris, haven’t been using it correctly. After reviewing how it worked on a few of my own sites, I have overhauled my uses – and built up a “minimum understanding” of it which has been, to say the least, useful. So, there it is: the absolute bare minimum of Cache-Control knowledge you may need for a public, mostly-static (CMS-driven, let’s say) website. Strap in, this is going to be wild. And be mindful of one thing: I do not work for Vercel, CloudFlare, AWS or Fastly. I just like fast websites and I think you deserve to have your website go fast as well.</description>

      <link>https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-06-16-ban-asn</link>
      <description>More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers, since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter based on IP numbers won’t catch them. But if we can determine their autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.</description>

      <title>Beyond Token Limits: Why the Apple LRM Rebuttal Misses the Point :: Victor's Blog</title>
      <link>https://victoramartinez.com/posts/why-claudes-comment-paper-is-a-poor-rebuttal/</link>
      <description>Recently Apple published a paper on LRMs (Large Reasoning Models) and how they found that “that LRMs have limitations in exact computation” and that “they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles.” I would consider this a death blow paper to the current push for using LLMs and LRMs as the basis for AGI. Subbaro Kambhampati and Yann LeCun seem to agree. You could say that the paper knocked out LLMs. More recently, a comment paper showed up on Arxiv and shared around X as a rebuttal to Apple’s paper. Putting aside the stunt of having Claude Opus as a co-author (yes, I’m not kidding), the paper in itself is a poor rebuttal for many reasons which we shall explore, but mainly for missing the entire point of the paper and prior research by AI researchers such as Professor Kambhampati.</description>
