      <title>C++ coroutines: Associating multiple task types with the same promise type | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210423-00/?p=105146</link>
      <description>We created two very similiar promises for hot-start and cold-start coroutines. It turns out that we can unify them. The association between a promise and a task is not one-to-one, but rather one-to-many: A single promise can back multiple tasks. But how can you do that?</description>

      <title>Cerebras’ New Monster AI Chip Adds 1.4 Trillion Transistors - IEEE Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/processors/cerebras-giant-ai-chip-now-has-a-trillions-more-transistors</link>
      <description>Almost from the moment Cerebras Systems announced a&amp;#160;computer based on the largest single computer chip ever built, the&amp;#160;Silicon Valley startup declared its intentions to build an&amp;#160;even heftier processor. Today, the company announced that its next-gen chip,&amp;#160;the Wafer Scale Engine 2 (WSE 2), will be available in the 3rd quarter of this year. WSE 2 is just as big physically as its predecessor, but it has enormously increased amounts of, well, everything. The goal is to&amp;#160;keep ahead of the ever-increasing size of neural networks used in machine learning.</description>
