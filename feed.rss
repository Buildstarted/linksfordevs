      <description>Deep Learning has changed the game in speech recognition with the introduction of end-to-end models. These models take in audio, and directly output transcriptions. Two of the most popular end-to-end models today are Deep Speech by Baidu, and Listen Attend Spell (LAS) by Google. Both Deep Speech</description>

      <title>Is BGP safe yet? · Cloudflare</title>
      <link>https://isbgpsafeyet.com/</link>
      <description>On the Internet, network devices exchange routes via a protocol called BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Unfortunately, issues with BGP have led to malicious actors being able to hijack and misconfigure devices leading to security problems which have the potential to cause widespread problems. BGP security can be greatly improved by using technologies such as RPKI to sign Internet routes. This page attempts to track the progress of major Internet players (ISPs, transit operators, and content providers) in their progress to adopt RPKI and other technologies.</description>

      <title>How I made a basketball hoop that always goes in</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtN4tkvcBMA</link>
      <description>I've wondered if it is possible to make a basketball hoop where the ball always goes in. Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often. In this video I show how I wrote a program to calculate the optical backboard then machined and fabricated it. It worked out better than I was expected so I'm really happy with it!

*Sorry for the re-upload to anyone who saw the first one. I made a major rookie mistake and uploaded the wrong file. yikes! Lesson learned.*

      <description>Over the last few months I have been trying to push my understanding of Physically Based Shading, by actively exploring every corner and turning over every stone, to uncover any area where I lack knowledge. Although this is still an ongoing process and I still have a lot to do, I thought I could already share some of what I have learned in the process.</description>

      <title>Trains․NET - Episode 25 - Fighting with Blazor to JavaScript interop to try to extract some speed</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaEhO8dVAjc</link>
      <description>Originally streamed at https://twitch.tv/davidwengier

In this episode we finish off drawing on a HTML canvas and hook up some mouse events, only to be hit by the brick wall of terrible performance with interop between .NET running on WASM and trying to call JavaScript in the browser. Technically it works, just not very well 😀</description>
