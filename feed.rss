      <title>irhum.github.io - Tensor Parallelism with jax.pjit</title>
      <link>https://irhum.github.io/blog/pjit/#partitioning-in-jax?utm_source=hnblogs.substack.com</link>
      <description>With proper sharding, LLMs can scale far beyond the memory capacity of a single GPU/TPU. We explore the math underpinning this from the ground up, and then implement a fully working implementation with JAX/Flax.</description>

      <title>Hush WKWebView</title>
      <link>https://josh.blog/2023/04/hush-wkwebview</link>
      <description>If you’re building an iOS app with webviews, you need to decide whether to use WKWebView or SFSafariViewController. The WebView version gives you a lot more control, but you can’t use Safari Extensions. On the other hand, the Safari version automatically gets some of the features of Safari like content blocking extensions, but customization options are pretty limited and it doesn’t support loading local HTML files.</description>

      <title>Unearthing lessons from 2008: My first Mac apps</title>
      <link>https://notes.npilk.com/lessons-from-first-apps</link>
      <description>I reminisce about the first software I ever shipped—a pair of Mac apps created when I was in high school. Despite their simplicity and flaws, these apps gained surprising popularity, leading me to reflect on the lessons I can learn from their success and apply to my current projects.</description>

      <description>Deploying with Ansible is easy. Just copy files over, restart services, and observe a new version of the app. But that might break some connections if some user was just waiting for the server&amp;#39;s response. What to do then?   Base infrastructure</description>

      <title>UB Might Be a Wrong Term for Newer Languages</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2023/04/02/ub-might-be-the-wrong-term-for-newer-languages.html</link>
      <description>A short note on undefined behavior, which assumes familiarity with the subject (see this article for the introduction).
The TL;DR is that I think that carrying the wording from the C standard into newer languages, like Zig and Rust, might be a mistake.
This is strictly the word choice, the lexical syntax of the comments argument.</description>

      <title>Magnon-based computation could signal computing paradigm shift</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2023-03-magnon-based-paradigm-shift.html</link>
      <description>Like electronics or photonics, magnonics is an engineering subfield that aims to advance information technologies when it comes to speed, device architecture, and energy consumption. A magnon corresponds to the specific amount of energy required to change the magnetization of a material via a collective excitation called a spin wave.</description>

      <link>https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2023/04/extending-structural-functions-to-scalars/</link>
      <description>Traditionally, the set of monadic reversing or reflecting primitives,&amp;#160;Reverse-First (⊖), Transpose (⍉), and Reverse&amp;#160;(⌽) apply to entire arrays and are defined as identity functions on scalar arguments. Dyalog v19.0 extends the definitions to provide equivalent reflections on scalars.</description>

      <title>Michael Tsai - Blog - HomePod Late Adopter</title>
      <link>https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/03/31/homepod-late-adopter/</link>
      <description>We’ve been using an Amazon Echo Dot in our kitchen for several years, principally for timers and answering basic questions. Lately, it has not been responding as reliably. Also, it never worked well as a Bluetooth speaker for my iPhone because the phone would always reconnect to the Echo, even when I was in a different room trying to use my AirPods or just the built-in speaker. I decided to finally give HomePod a try and ordered a HomePod mini about a month ago. This is my experience as someone who has read about HomePod and Home.app since the beginning but never actually used them until now.</description>

      <description>I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.</description>
