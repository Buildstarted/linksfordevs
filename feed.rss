      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been around long enough now to remember when we used different words to refer to our favorite apps and websites. Long before the words Platform, Service, or Ecosystem infected our discourse there were Tools. And I think we need fewer of the former and more of the latter.</description>

      <title>static vs dynamic types</title>
      <link>https://breadchris.com/thinkies/static-vs-dynamic-types/</link>
      <description>The debate between statically and dynamically typed languages has always been a hot topic in software development. Designing types for a problem can feel like solving a puzzle—fun for some and frustrating for others. But the real question is: Do you know how to represent the domain? While the alpha engineer may claim they do, understanding a domain comes from observing patterns over time.
The challenge in business, where code is most commonly used, is collecting and understanding the data needed to define these types accurately.</description>

      <title>Daily Driving Ubuntu Asahi for Over a Month</title>
      <link>https://www.feliciano.tech/blog/daily-driving-ubuntu-asahi-for-over-a-month/</link>
      <description>I recently got laid off and got 100% custody of my MacBook Pro. I’m not a fan of macOS, but I run it because Apple’s systems are locked down. Not anymore. Asahi Linux has come a long way, spawning Fedora Asahi and, more recently, Ubuntu Asahi. Ubuntu has been my primary operating system for ~14 years, so the chance of running it natively on my MacBook Pro was appetizing.
With full admin access to the laptop, I installed Ubuntu Asahi.</description>

      <title>Poking at Threads in the Fediverse</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2024/03/22/poking-at-threads-in-the-fediverse</link>
      <description>Yesterday, the Threads team started rolling out their fediverse integration to users in the US, Canada, and Japan. I tried signing up for this when I saw that some users were boosting their first cross-network posts. Sadly, the sign-up process 1 didn’t work all Thursday for me. It all worked this morning though, and I’ve spent some time poking at it. The sign-up process is quite nice when it’s working. There’s a nice overview of federated networking as part of the sign-up/consent flow.&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <description>Okay, I don’t actually hate sexy, I’m just not into “sexy” businesses. If I’m rolling into a pitch with a pair of shades saying, this is the “hottest new thing - like sex but with computers”, I’ve done something wrong.
After working for and with many startups, the things I am most interested in are businesses that don’t ooze sex appeal. I like businesses that enable positive changes or facilitate important aspects of our life.</description>
