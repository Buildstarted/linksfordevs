      <description>Every six months or so, this neat group called the International Earth 
Rotation Service issues a directive on whether there will be a leap 
second inserted at the end of that six month period.  You usually find 
out at the beginning of January or the beginning of July, and thus would 
have a leap second event at the end of June or December, respectively.</description>

      <title>C# Socket Programming Essentials: Creating and Configuring Sockets - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/c-socket-programming-essentials-creating-and-configuring-sockets/</link>
      <description>If you’ve ever wondered how applications like chat messengers or multiplayer games keep us connected, sockets are the unsung heroes behind the scenes. The concept of socket programming dates back to the early days of the internet, when developers needed a way to establish communication between different devices. In this post, we’ll dive into the essentials of socket programming in C#, focusing on creating and configuring sockets. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just getting your feet wet in network programming, these fundamentals will help you get started.</description>

Want to build a rock-solid .NET project that won&amp;#39;t give you headaches later? This video shows you how to set up your project the right way from day one. We&amp;#39;ll cover everything from basic setup to some really cool tools - like using .editorconfig to keep your code clean, managing all your packages in one place, and catching bugs early with code analysis. You&amp;#39;ll also learn how to package your app with Docker, orchestrate it using Docker Compose or the shiny new .NET Aspire, and automate your builds with GitHub Actions. Perfect for anyone who wants to level up their .NET game and build projects like a pro.

      <description>Missing out of jobs because of LeetCode
At the end of the last year, my previous workplace ( Weaveworks ) went bankrupt. I found myself without a job.
I didn’t have to interview for a long time and I certainly wasn’t planning on it any time soon. I enjoyed my
work.
Thus, I started to learn a bit because I forgot how to interview. I refreshed my knowledge on LeetCode, I
did some exercises, I read some books, post, whatever. I refreshed my algo knowledge because that’s what people
most likely will ask, right?</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Power of AI: Jim Bennett on Pieces for Developers</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=_CGh61pdhMs</link>
      <description>RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software&amp;#39;s Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes &amp;quot;So we&amp;#39;re dealing with code bases that are getting bigger and bigger every day. You know, those million line code bases, two million line code bases is not unusual. We are being pushed to do more. I remember when I was working at Microsoft a couple of years ago, Satya Nadella, CEO, his favourite phrase was, &amp;quot;you have to do more with less.&amp;quot; But yeah, so Satya was big on this idea of do more with less. And this has kind of resonated across the industry as a whole.&amp;quot;— Jim Bennett

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I&amp;#39;m Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.

 In this episode, Jim Bennett returns to the show after a six-year absence. In his previous appearance, Jim introduced us to Xamarin, but in the time since that appearance, Xamarin has been sunsetted. So it felt natural to start our conversation about the wonderful outpouring of support over on X with the hashtag #XamarinGaveMe.

 The main topic of conversation is about Generative AI, Large Language Models, and how the new startup, Pieces, can help developers to keep the context of what they are working on at the front of their mind at all times; both when they are online and off.

 &amp;quot;If I said to you, &amp;quot;which character from the Pixar movie Up are you?&amp;quot; The answer is going to be, &amp;quot;Doug,&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;re all Doug. We&amp;#39;re all like, &amp;quot;squirrel!&amp;quot;

 So if we have to go from our IDE to a browser to ask a question, we&amp;#39;re reading email on the way. We are looking at chat tools on the way. Oh, we&amp;#39;re in a browser. &amp;quot;Oh, I&amp;#39;ve got a notification on Blue Sky. I&amp;#39;m going to have a look at that.&amp;quot; We are context switching. We are distracted. We are drinking coffee. We are losing our productivity&amp;quot;— Jim Bennett

 Anyway, without further ado, let&amp;#39;s sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we&amp;#39;ll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

 My voice was created using Generative AI.

      <description>Large language models like ChatGPT &amp;amp; Claude have become
ubiquitous in today’s world. I visited a friend for the New years eve
and was impressed by how ChatGPT was being extensively used within the
family. The friend’s little kid is going to grow up in a world, where
turning to large language models (LLM) for quick answers is going to be
the norm rather than the exception.</description>

      <title>Trying and failing to interpret sentence embeddings</title>
      <link>https://timbrell.dev/ai/2025/01/09/trying-and-failing-to-interpret-embeddings.html</link>
      <description>I was born with congenital anosmia i.e. I cannot and have never been able to smell. Farts, flowers, cookies, and perfume; I have no personal experience of any of these smells. Yet, I can tell you that farts take over a room and cookies smell like home. This is all picked up through context. It’s picked up from watching my friends retching at the stench of the small animal that died in the vents of my middle school. For me, a smell is defined by its relation to other smells and the emotive descriptions of others. This is not altogether different from a sentence embedding.</description>
