      <title>RAID-Z Expansion Feature for ZFS Goes Live | FreeBSD Foundation</title>
      <link>https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/raid-z-expansion-feature-for-zfs-goes-live/</link>
      <description>How it works The feature reflows existing data, essentially rewriting it onto a new arrangement of disks – meaning the original group plus a newly added disk. In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical […]</description>

      <link>https://www.adainese.it/blog/2022/02/08/auditing-active-directory-passwords-against-haveibeenpwned/</link>
      <description>Any password policy, even with strict rules, can be easily bypassed with simple tricks: Passw0rd!, Passw0rd$, Password!1 can be all valid passwords for length and complexity.
It this common scenario it’s useful to regularly audit Active Directory passwords against password dictionaries (like RockYou) and/or HaveIBeenPwned.</description>

      <description>C# 10.0 lets us annotate the nullability aspects of generic code more naturally than older versions. Some places where the AllowNull attribute was once required can now just use the obvious nullability syntax.</description>

      <title>Dolphin Progress Report: November and December 2021, January 2022</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/02/08/dolphin-progress-report-nov-and-dec-2021-jan-2022/</link>
      <description>This year, we&amp;#39;ve hit an important milestone that&amp;#39;s been in the works for nearly a decade. In late 2012, Sonicadvance1 began work on Dolphin&amp;#39;s ARM JIT. Back then, there weren&amp;#39;t any devices that had even a sliver of hope of running Dolphin close to full speed, but that wasn&amp;#39;t really the goal. All he wanted to do was see if it could be done; it sounded like a fun, challenging project. However, as time passed the idea turned into more than just a passing curiosity. Users were more than happy to donate to cover the hardware cost of staying on the bleeding edge of a rapidly evolving ecosystem, allowing ARM development to flourish. By 2015, Sonicadvance1 astounded developers and the community alike with footage of Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&amp;#39;s time trial mode running close to full speed.
On that note, we&amp;#39;re happy to announce that Dolphin&amp;#39;s AArch64 JIT has finally reached feature parity with Dolphin&amp;#39;s x86-64 JIT. This means that every PowerPC instruction that the x86-64 JIT supports along with every major JIT feature are now supported in the AArch64 JIT! And this is a great time for ARM in general, with each generation of processor pushing the boundaries and companies like Apple adopting the architecture for larger and higher power devices like their M1 Mac line. For those on mobile phones and tablets, Adreno powered devices provide decent enough graphics drivers to get a reasonable experience at this point. And with a critical bottleneck getting fixed just days ago, performance on Adreno GPUs has skyrocketed. You won&amp;#39;t have to scroll far for that news, we promise.
But that&amp;#39;s only the tip of the iceberg; we&amp;#39;ve had three months worth of changes pile up and some other important infrastructure news. We&amp;#39;ve improved the user experience on macOS significantly and restored support for older devices. In fact, enough has happened that we&amp;#39;ll be detailing the status of Dolphin&amp;#39;s macOS support near the end of the report.
And... we haven&amp;#39;t even talked about any emulation fixes yet. The past three months have had tons of changes that would have normally been the highlight of a Progress Report. The three month gap between reports was not because of a lack of changes. Want to take Riivolution games on netplay? You can. Hate the EA VP6 bugs? Make them a thing of the past with a new option. Wish your favorite LogicOp game worked on GLES or MoltenVK? Odds are, it does now! The list goes on, but outlining everything would take way too long, so let&amp;#39;s just dive in. Please enjoy the November, December, and January Progress Report!</description>

      <description>I started programming when I was 13 years old. I stole my brothers HTML and Javascript book and built some simple web forms. I had no idea that a backend was needed or even what a backend was. I just knew I had some gray buttons on the screen and it did things. I went on to play with some web forum software, launching my own unsuccessful internet forum.</description>
