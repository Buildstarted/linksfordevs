      <title>PyTorch Performance Features and How They Interact</title>
      <link>https://paulbridger.com/posts/pytorch-tuning-tips/</link>
      <description>PyTorch in 2023 is a complex beast, with many great performance features hidden away. Simple top-N lists are weak content, so I’ve empirically tested the most important PyTorch tuning techniques and settings in all combinations. I’ve benchmarked inference across a handful of different model architectures and sizes, different versions of PyTorch and even different Docker containers.</description>

      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/leverage-richness-http-status-codes/</link>
      <description>If you’re not a REST expert, you probably use the same HTTP codes over and over in your responses, mostly 200, 404, and 500. If using authentication, you might perhaps add 401 and 403; if using redirects 301 and 302, that might be all. But the range of possible status codes is much broader than that and can improve semantics a lot. While many discussions about REST focus on entities and methods, using the correct response status codes can make your API stand out. 201: Created Many appli</description>
