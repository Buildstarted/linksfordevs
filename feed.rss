      <title>Predicting Barrel Rate with Fast Swing Rate ‚Äì Running on Numbers</title>
      <link>https://runningonnumbers.com/posts/fast-swings-and-barrels/</link>
      <description>In this article, we will explore the relationship between swing speed and barrel rate in Major League Baseball (MLB) players. Barrel rate is a key metric that measures the percentage of batted balls that are classified as ‚Äúbarrels,‚Äù which are hits with a high probability of resulting in extra-base hits. According to MLB, batted-ball events classified as Barrels had lead to a ‚Äúminium 0.500 batting average and 1.500 slugging percentage‚Äù ‚ÄúStandard Stats  Glossary‚Äù (2025). By understanding how swing speed impacts barrel rate, we can gain insights into player performance and potentially identify areas for improvement. We will use a linear regression model but with an added twist: we will apply a square root transformation to capture non-linear relationships between swing speed and barrel rate. I refer you to my previous article on linear regressions for a refresher on the topic.</description>

      <title>Artificial, not intelligent - Max van IJsselmuiden</title>
      <link>https://www.maxvanijsselmuiden.nl/artificial-not-intelligent</link>
      <description>The tech industry's rush to cram AI into every product is making software worse and more expensive, forcing users to pay for features they don't want or need. From AI buttons on mice to mandatory chatbots in browsers, these integrations prioritize revenue extraction over user experience. Good software should respect users' time and intelligence, not exploit them through forced feature bloat.</description>

      <title>Interfaces That Augment or Replace</title>
      <link>https://zehfernandes.com/posts/interfaces-that-augment-or-replace</link>
      <description>There's a scene in a movie that captures the concept of Tools for Thought perfectly. The film Searching (2018) ¬π unfolds entirely from the perspective of computer screens. After a frustrating call to the police about his missing 16-year-old daughter, the father decides to investigate on his own. To organize his thoughts, he opens an Excel spreadsheet and begins laying out everything that's in his head. As the investigation progresses, we watch him continuously update the spreadsheet with each new piece of information.</description>

      <title>Clowns to the left of me ‚Ä¶</title>
      <link>https://blog.korny.info/2025/07/19/clowns-to-the-left-of-me</link>
      <description>I‚Äôve had the song ‚ÄúStuck in the Middle with You‚Äù in my head for a few weeks. (R.I.P. Michael Madsen!)  1  But not because of Reservoir Dogs - but because of the public discussion about AI coding tools. (Yes, I know‚Ä¶ feel free to walk away if you are sick of the whole thing).  I feel like there‚Äôs this strange culture war, or something like it, playing out - with wild statements on both extremes - and I‚Äôm stuck in the middle.  Hype To the left of me  There is just so much AI Hype.  I‚Äôm talking here mainly about software development tools. There‚Äôs plenty more ludicrous hype when it comes to other AI areas, but I‚Äôm trying to limit this to software engineering.  And the hype, as well as the na√Øvet√©, is extreme. You get people vibe coding their entire business applications with no thoughts of security. You get people claiming 50x speed improvements, or indeed ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need developers at all‚Äù. You get people posting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a programmer but I used Copilot to build my entire product and it‚Äôs awesome‚Äù, with multiple variations of this. Online discussion forums seem to be full of highly risky advice - ‚ÄúI just turn on --dangerously-skip-permissions‚Äù or ‚Äúuse this MCP server which gives write access to your git repo and reads user-supplied comments‚Äù2 or even worse.  Amusingly there‚Äôs also quite a few comments like ‚Äúoops I deleted my whole file system, what do I do now?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a programmer and I got Copilot to build my product but now it‚Äôs broken and won‚Äôt change anything - I want my money back‚Äù. There‚Äôs some tasty schadenfreude here but I also feel a bit sorry for some of these people, where things started so nicely, but now technical debt, AI slop, and a lack of the knowledge of what ‚Äúgood‚Äù looks like, are making it all fall apart.  A lot of the hype is just marketing - astroturfing from fake users, or just plain press releases breathlessly reported by the media, or marketing via dubious research articles. ‚ÄúLook at our amazing new model, it has so much more data than the last one, it is reasoning now! We ran these benchmarks to prove it!‚Äù  A lot of the hype though does seem to be genuine users - lured by the quick result, the slick prototype, the dopamine hit of seeing all that code produced, without the boring course-corrections that feel like waste. Once you are high on the ‚Äúlook how much code I can make‚Äù drug, it‚Äôs hard not to evangelise it to everyone else.  And as the last year or two have shown us, it‚Äôs very easy for people to be fooled by LLMs, which excel at looking like something they are not. People anthropomorphise the tools all the time - ‚ÄúWhy did Claude do this dumb thing? Can‚Äôt it see the example I‚Äôm looking at of how to do it?‚Äù - they start to think this is genuine intelligence that can reason and learn, not a specific set of tools.  LLMs are wonderful machines that read your data and questions and produce results in a way that feels like intelligence, but is actually just really clever pattern matching and a surrounding ecosystem of context sources and tools. Sometimes the results are amazing, occasionally they are terrible, and you always need to check the results because the process is fundamentally nondeterministic, and just because 99% of the time something worked, there‚Äôs always that 1% chance it was confidently wrong.  Skeptics to the right  On the other side - the anti-AI sentiment is also pretty wild.  I think most of these folks are well meaning - far more so than the pro-AI hypers; my sympathy is with healthy skepticism in general. But they are also prone to jumping on hype - for one example the Your Brain on ChatGPT paper, which is still in pre-print, not peer reviewed, and has had some serious criticism, still got a huge amount of coverage, including Time Magazine - this includes some classic moral panic language:     Her team did submit it for peer review but did not want to wait for approval, which can take eight or more months, to raise attention to an issue that Kosmyna believes is affecting children now.   Oh my goodness, will nobody protect our children?!  Similarly the recent study on experienced open-source developer productivity is being waved around to say ‚Äúthis proves they don‚Äôt work‚Äù - I think this has been shared multiple times on every single tech forum I frequent. The authors of the paper evidently expected this, and provided this table, which doesn‚Äôt seem to get as much mention as their headlines:    And this interesting breakdown of likely contributing factors:    This study is actually pretty interesting - and it does show where we should be cautious to assume self-assessment of how good these tools are. And probably real limitations in large complex codebases. But it‚Äôs no ‚ÄúAh-ha! The emperor has no clothes!‚Äù moment, as far as I can tell. (After I wrote this, I found that Simon Willison has a good discussion of this paper as well - and there‚Äôs a rather more severe critique at Cat Hick‚Äôs blog )  I also see quite a few people who have tried the most basic, un-assisted, low-context tools, and get terrible results; and then rule out AI tools as fundamentally broken. ‚ÄúI used copilot and its suggestions are wrong 40% of the time, often ludicrously wrong‚Äù. This was where I was at 6 months ago - Copilot seemed like a handy yet often irritating Clippy, no big deal. I think this drives a lot of skepticism, people who feel they gave it a go, it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype, so they‚Äôve made up their minds.  And generally there‚Äôs just a lot of anger and frustration, in reaction to the constant flood of hype:    As I said before, I‚Äôm more sympathetic to the skeptics than the hypers. Especially when it comes to the broader AI industry - I‚Äôm always keen to read David Gerard‚Äôs Pivot to AI or any of Ed Zitron‚Äôs rants - see also my downsides section later.  But - I do find that there‚Äôs a lot of talk about AI software development tools, that just plain conflicts with my personal experience.  Stuck in the middle  So here‚Äôs the problem - every day I‚Äôm flooded with articles that are ludicrously positive and ludicrously negative. But what I‚Äôm seeing doesn‚Äôt match either.  I personally find the tools helpful, powerful, and a definite boost. Maybe, as per the METR study, I‚Äôm losing more time learning the tools, and tweaking the context, and reading and experimenting and correcting when they get wrong, compared to the time actually saved.  But some of this is the startup costs with any new technology; some will only be paid once, some will be a slow gradual tax, especially with a technology that is changing so fast. And some will be a learning curve for us to learn when to say ‚ÄúOk, this task isn‚Äôt suited to LLMs and I should just do it by hand‚Äù.  And they are already giving me a bunch of obvious speedups, small and large. Claude is fixing the links in this blog as I type. Claude wrote the tiny python script I use daily to list our project‚Äôs outstanding pull requests.  Claude wrote a little visualisation of git activity I needed for management. Claude is drawing simple Mermaid diagrams in our docs. Claude helped me use Snyk to find that our project had an insecure dependency, and Sourcebot to find that another project of ours had the same dependency and had a viable workaround.  And for a larger example, I‚Äôve written up a separate blog post detailing how I used Claude Code to implement a Kafka messaging feature in an ASP.Net Core application. This demonstrates what can actually be done with AI coding tools today - not the wild hype, not the complete dismissal, but practical reality.  What‚Äôs next?  I‚Äôm still learning - I‚Äôve made masses of progress in the couple of months since I started using the tools in anger, and there‚Äôs a lot more to learn!  I also want to learn how to guide our organisation, so our developers know how to use these tools effectively, carefully, and productively.  It‚Äôs an exciting time - I‚Äôm having more fun with these tools than I expected. There are so many benefits already, and so much potential for more.  But‚Ä¶  Don‚Äôt forget the downsides  I need this standard disclaimer at the end of any AI post. We must remember the context behind these tools - there are giant tech companies pushing these hard into every corner of our lives. They are run by horrible tech broligarchs3 whose interests are personal power and destabilising democracy, not helping the world.  They consume vast amounts of power, which due to our failure to charge for externalities, mean they are burning fossil fuels, consuming scarce water, and accelerating the climate crisis. And there are many signs that the funding for this is an unsustainable bubble and the companies and tools may collapse, or start charging significantly more and/or enshittifying the experience of users.  Further reading  I‚Äôm not alone, stuck here in the middle. For some good sensible approaches I‚Äôd also recommend Birgitta B√∂ckeler and Pete Hodgson and of course Simon Willison‚Äôs blog is essential reading.

      <description>Hoot is an iOS app that I created for the benefit of my partner, Alana. She gave me the idea for an app that prompts users once per day with a question. Everyone answers that question at the same time, then sees each others' answers. The purpose is to stimulate conversation among friends. As Alana said "my friends are moving to different cities. Our regular chats will become more infrequent if we don't have something to prompt conversation." She used to use Twitter with her friends for this purpose, but none of them use it anymore.</description>
