      <title>Figuring out round, floor and ceil with integer division</title>
      <link>http://blog.pkh.me/p/36-figuring-out-round%2C-floor-and-ceil-with-integer-division.html</link>
      <description>Lately I&amp;#39;ve been transforming a float based algorithm to integers in order to
make it bit-exact. Preserving the precision as best as possible was way more
challenging than I initially though, which forced me to go deep down the rabbit
hole. During the process I realized I had many wrong assumptions about integer
divisions, and also discovered some remarkably useful mathematical properties.</description>

      <title>From Ubuntu to NixOS the story of a mastodon migration</title>
      <link>https://gianarb.it/blog/from-ubuntu-to-nixos-history-of-a-mastodon-migration</link>
      <description>Twitter is not at its best. Developers are looking for an alternative as many others. Mastodon with its decentralized and feel of ownership is raising in popularity. I started with a hands crafted self hosted Ubuntu server because I felt the pressure about joining as early as possible but the end goal was to use NixOS for that. This is the story of how I moved my Mastodon instance to NixOS</description>

      <title>Ask What, Not How: Why you should write declarative code</title>
      <link>https://yusufbirader.com/blog/content/ask-what-not-how/</link>
      <description>It is a well-known fact that code is read far more than it is written. Maintaining code readability is a key object for every writer of software.
And so any approach which allows us to achieve this should be adopted with fervour.
In the early days of structured programming, most code was written using an imperative approach.
Imperative code describes how a problem should be solved. In other words, imperative code specifies each step to be taken by the computer to transform input to output.</description>

      <title>A No Nonsense Guide to Unicode</title>
      <link>https://yusufbirader.com/blog/content/a-no-nonsense-guide-to-unicode/</link>
      <description>“Software is eating the world”, Marc Andreessen famously declared in 2011.
The ability to represent text in any of the world’s languages is crucial to modern applications.
The Unicode standard provides this capability, improving upon early character sets such as ASCII, which ignore the 94% of the world’s non-English speaking inhabitants.
Understanding Unicode is key to working with text in modern digital systems.
The Basics of Character Encodings Let’s start from the beginning.</description>

      <description>For a while now I’ve been keeping a close eye on the structure logging proposal making its way through Go’s language proposal process. Last month an experimental version of the proposal was released under the golang.org/x/exp package (see documentation here) and I decided to experiment with it and decided to summarise my learnings in a blog for others to learn more about this proposed addition to the Go standard library.</description>
