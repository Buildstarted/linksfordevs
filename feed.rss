      <title>How I ruined my vacation by reverse engineering WSC</title>
      <link>https://blog.es3n1n.eu/posts/how-i-ruined-my-vacation/</link>

Even though this is most likely not what you expected to see here, but rather than going into full technical details on how everything works, I will describe what rabbitholes I went through and how painful everything was due to my ‚ú®special‚ú® environment.</description>
