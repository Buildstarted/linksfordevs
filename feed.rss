      <title>Giphy CLI - BuiltWithDot.Net</title>

      <description>Unofficial Giphy CLI as a global dotnet tool. 

Search for a giphy from the command line and just copy the url or markdown. It even has preview for iTerm2. Wrote this because I always forget the markdown syntax for images.</description>

      <title>Paths to the Future: A Year at Google Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.debugmind.com/2020/01/04/paths-to-the-future-a-year-at-google-brain/</link>
      <description>I am currently a PhD student at Stanford, studying optimization and machine learning with Stephen Boyd, but from 2017 through 2018 I was a software engineer on the Google Brain team. I started three months after receiving a Master’s degree in computer science (also from Stanford), having just spent the summer working on a research project—a domain-specific language for convex optimization. At the time, a part of me wanted to continue working with my advisor, but another part of me was deeply curious about Google Brain. To see a famous artificial intelligence (AI) research lab from the inside would, at the very least, make for an interesting anthropological experience. So, I joined Google. My assignment was to work on TensorFlow, an open-source software library for deep learning.</description>

      <title>Why I Did Not Go To Jail - Andreessen Horowitz</title>
      <link>https://a16z.com/2014/02/06/why-i-did-not-go-to-jail/</link>
      <description>BY BEN HOROWITZ
A lot of people have been asking me what my upcoming book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things, will be like. Here&amp;#39;s a piece that I wrote for the book that did not make the cut. I still think it&amp;#39;s a pretty good story and gives you a flavor.

I just tell the truth so I&amp;#39;m cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain&amp;#39;t ever met a good cop
—Drake, “I’m Goin In”

After we transitioned the business from Loudcloud to Opsware, we needed a head of finance. Therefore, when the CFO from one of the best-run enterprise software companies became available, I jumped at the chance to hire her.

Michelle (note: her name has been changed) comprehensively understood software accounting, business models, and best practices, and she was beloved by Wall Street in no small part due to her honest and straightforward reporting of her previous company’s business. In my reference checking, at least a dozen investors told me that they made far more money when the numbers disappointed than when the company outperformed, because they trusted Michelle when she said that things were not worse than they appeared and bought on the dips.&amp;#160;MORE</description>

      <link>https://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Negative_2000_Lines_Of_Code.txt</link>
      <description>In early 1982, the Lisa software team was trying to buckle down for the big push to ship the software within the next six months.  Some of the managers decided that it would be a good idea to track the progress of each individual engineer in terms of the amount of code that they wrote from week to week.  They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week.</description>

      <description>A fully featured C# wrapper for the pinboard.in API. 

Pinboard.in is a clean bookmarking website that lacked a good .Net API and I decided to write one.

Since it is written on the Netstandard platform, it can be used across multiple types of projects.</description>
