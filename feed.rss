      <title>CSS Animation with offset-path</title>
      <link>https://yuanchuan.dev/css-animation-with-offset-path</link>
      <description>This is from last year when I tried to recreate Rach Smith's P5.js animation using CSS.
    The animation seemed like it could be implemented in a breeze, but there's an illusion of simplicity.
    The process of manually updating the positions and directions of each box was
    a bit tricky.</description>

      <title>On Product-Market Fit</title>
      <link>https://cra.mr/on-product-market-fit/</link>
      <description>One of the most difficult challenges I've faced in my career is figuring out product-market fit. I'd wager most of us have gotten there through sheer dumb luck. What do we do if we're not lucky, if we don't strike gold on our first try? I don't know if I have the answer. What I can do is try to break down what worked for Sentry's error monitoring - a reverse engineering of sorts - and reason about how we'd apply that to new products.</description>

      <title>Structure And Meaning</title>
      <link>https://shrsv.github.io/p/structure-and-meaning/</link>
      <description>‚ÄúUp, down, up, down, up, down, ‚Ä¶‚Äù
What comes next?
You know the answer - it is ‚ÄúUp‚Äù
How did you know it?
Your mind inferred some sort of structure, and made a guess
I mean - we do not know - what truly will come next.
But we are pretty sure - due to the repetition - and we expect it to be ‚Äúup‚Äù.
There could be a breakage of pattern, but the fact that we expected an outcome - that hints at underlying structure.

      <title>OCaml‚Äôs Standard Library (Stdlib)</title>
      <link>https://batsov.com/articles/2025/03/14/ocaml-s-standard-library/</link>
      <description>Every programming language comes with some ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù included - mostly in the form of its standard library. That‚Äôs typically all of the functionality that‚Äôs available out-of-the-box, without the need to install additional libraries. (although the definition varies from language to language) Usually standard libraries are pretty similar, but I think that OCaml‚Äôs a bit ‚Äúweird‚Äù and slightly surprising in some regards, so I decided to write down a few thoughts on it and how to make the best of it.</description>

      <title>How To Validate Email Addresses in C#? - Oli De Bastiani</title>
      <link>https://debastiani.net/Blog/how-to-validate-email-addresses-in-csharp</link>
      <description>Numerous applications rely on email addresses to recognize users. Since email addresses are unique, they serve as a reliable way of verifying the authenticity of a user. However, sending emails to incorrect addresses can result in errors. This is why the format of an email address is typically checked after it is entered. While some developers utilize RegEx for this purpose, is it truly the best practice?</description>

      <title>Does unsafe undermine Rust's guarantees?</title>
      <link>https://steveklabnik.com/writing/does-unsafe-undermine-rusts-guarantees/</link>
      <description>When people first hear about unsafe in Rust, they often have questions. A very
normal thing to ask is, ‚Äúwait a minute, doesn‚Äôt this defeat the purpose?‚Äù And while
it‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable question, the answer is both straightforward and has a
lot of nuance. So let‚Äôs talk about it.</description>

      <title>.NET Aspire for Mobile Apps?!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=RCIM6qagZ-U</link>
      <description>You probably know about .NET Aspire by now and how great it is for web applications, containers and cloud apps. What if I told you that it can also be VERY useful for mobile app development? Insights in metrics, tracing those HTTP requests and no more fumbling with endpoint addresses? All possible with .NET Aspire!

In this video I will show you how to get started with .NET MAUI and .NET Aspire and how that can make your life a lot easier. I'd love to hear from you if this is something you would want to see supported and if and how its working for you if you decide to try it.

      <title>REST Constraint #2: Why Client-Server Separation is a Game Changer - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>

      <description>The internet as we know it thrives on separation‚Äîspecifically, the separation of clients and servers. It‚Äôs a fundamental principle of REST and a key factor in building scalable, maintainable, and flexible applications. But what exactly does this separation mean, and why does it matter? Let‚Äôs dive into the Client-Server constraint, one of REST‚Äôs six core architectural principles.</description>
