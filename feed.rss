      <description>'If you look at what people actually do to be happier, it seems nearly everyone tries to change the external facts: we try to become richer, thinner, more successful, to find a better house in a nicer area, and so on. A few of us think about trying to spend less time working, and more time on hobbies or with friends and family. Almost no one thinks about actively retraining the way they think. In fact, I don’t think this last idea even crosses most of our minds.'</description>

      <title>Sleep Tracking: My Oura Ring Review (After Two Years) — Remo Uherek</title>
      <link>https://remo.org/2020/06/25/sleep-tracking-oura-ring-review/</link>
      <description>I have been using the Oura sleep tracking ring for almost two years now. I immediately fell in love with the form factor, as I can’t stand watches or bracelets. When do I wear it? I used to wear it all the time, but then switched to night-only. I’m not interested in tracking my steps...</description>

      <title>The illusion of statelessness</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/illusion-statelessness/</link>
      <description>Some libraries, frameworks, components, and architectures either encourage statelessness, or make it a requirement. While statelessness has a lot of benefits, it’s unfortunately rarely possible in the real world. In this post, I’d like to detail this stance of mine a bit. State in Functional Programming Functional Programming is based on a set of principles. Among those principles are pure functions: A pure function is a function that has the following properties: Its return </description>

      <description>In this post, I want to describe the strategy I've used in the last
implementation of one of my side projects. The side project is not important at
all, it's mostly a TODO/GTD task manager, but I use it as a test bed for
anything I'm interested in learning or trying out. The source code is
here and it is deployed
here if you want to try this out.</description>

      <link>https://ymohamedahmed.github.io/post/pca/</link>
      <description>In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into PCA, from both a mathematical and implementation perspective. We’ll derive the equation from the ground up, look at how we can compute it and finally end with what it can be used for. This post is primarily targeted at those with a basic understanding of PCA but want to know the assumptions it relies on, its properties and derive how it can be computed.</description>

      <title>What accomplishments sound like on software engineering resumes</title>
      <link>https://jacobian.org/2020/may/8/engineering-resume-accomplishments/</link>
      <description>Effective resumes need to contain two things: responsibilities and accomplishments. The first tells the read what your job was; the second, what your results were. Unfortunately, most people fail at the second part. I’ve seen thousands — maybe tens of thousands — of resumes, and most don’t contain accomplishments. This makes it difficult for a hiring manager to get excited about your resume: knowing what you were supposed to do doesn’t tell a reader how well you did that thing.</description>

      <title>Linear scalable read-write lock</title>
      <link>https://blog.the-pans.com/shared-mutex/</link>
      <description>The basic concept of a read-write lock is simple. It allows multiple readers to
access the resource simultaneously, but at most one thread can have exclusive
ownership of the lock (a.k.a write lock). It's supposed to be an optimization,
comparing to simple mutex (e.g. std::mutex). As in theory, multiple readers do
not contend. Naively, read performance should scale linearly. However, this is
not the case in practice for most read-write locks, due to cacheline
pingpong-ing.

publications. Here, we examine how the number of downloads from Sci-hub as well
as various characteristics of publications and their authors predicts future
citations. Using data from 12 leading journals in economics, consumer research,
neuroscience, and multidisciplinary research, we found that articles downloaded
from Sci-hub were cited 1.72 times more than papers not downloaded from Sci-hub
and that the number of downloads from Sci-hub was a robust predictor of future
citations. Among other characteristics of publications, the number of figures
in a manuscript consistently predicts its future citations. The results suggest
that limited access to publications may limit some scientific research from
achieving its full impact.</description>
