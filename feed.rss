      <title>Junior Developers Can Lead Too! - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=rjBlMGjE5Is</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m only a junior -- is there any way I can demonstrate leadership skills?

This is a question I received on my Discord community, and I think it&amp;#39;s a great one.

Too often we associate things like leadership with titles, such as manager. But the reality is leadership is not a role or a title, it&amp;#39;s action that you can take.

Let&amp;#39;s see how leadership can show up regardless of your level as I discuss which things I&amp;#39;d recommend focusing on.

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>How decentralized is Bluesky really? -- Dustycloud Brainstorms</title>
      <link>https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/</link>
      <description>Recently due to various events (namely a lot of people getting off of
X-Twitter), Bluesky has become a lot more
popular, and excitement for its underlying protocol,
ATProto, is growing.
Since I worked on
ActivityPub which connects
together Mastodon,
Sharkey,
Peertube,
GotoSocial, etc, etc, etc in the present-day
fediverse, I often get asked whether or not I have opinions about
ATProto vs ActivityPub, and the answer is that I do have opinions, but
I am usually head-down focused on building what I hope to be the
next generation of decentralized (social) networking tech,
and so I keep to myself about such things except in private channels.</description>

      <title>Digital Sustainability and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://janikvonrotz.ch/2024/11/22/digital-sustainability-and-llms/</link>
      <description>This week I experienced:


Dinacon 2024 - a yearly conference about digital sustainability
Playing the game Factorio Space Age
Not having access to Codeium and therefore writing code “offline”
Not being able to buy an H100 GPU


And even though these events seem unrelated, I think they have a lot in common. This is all about over consumption and resource availability. Let me elaborate …</description>

      <title>Should Programming Languages be Safe or Powerful?</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-11-21_powerful_or_safe_languages/</link>
      <description>Should a programming language be powerful and let a programmer do a lot, or should it be safe and protect the programmer from bad mistakes? Contrary to what the title insinuates, these are not diametrically opposed attributes. Nevertheless, this is the mindset that underlies notions such as, “macros, manual memory management, etc. are power tools—they’re not supposed to be safe.” If safety and power are not necessarily opposed, why does this notion persist?</description>

      <description>Look, I’m no marriage counselor. But after a few years of navigating the complexities of married life, I’ve distilled my hard-won wisdom into two deceptively simple lines of code. If you can grasp these, you’ll be well on your way to a harmonious existence, even if your spouse insists on reorganizing the spice rack alphabetically.</description>

      <title>MassTransit SQL Transport Dashboard - ResQueue</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=I6_MMVdiFPM</link>
      <description>Using the SQL Transport with MassTransit is a great way to reduce infrastructure costs and dependencies. To go along with it, the community has created a dashboard front-end that visuals the queues and their message counts, and even allows browsing the queues, viewing headers, and tracking queues/messages that are used by job consumers (including recurring job consumers).
