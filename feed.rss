      <description>The South Korean megahit Squid Game is about a group of down-and-outers competing for life-altering sums of money (with the added risk of death). It&amp;#39;s bonkers and addictive but also, crucially, emotionally resonant</description>

      <title>Christians in Game Dev / Journalism</title>
      <link>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH6WT5RiJ6_Ovj3qWd1TvsM5bx4ZNjyVw-sP9w8uqF_V6R1A/viewform</link>
      <description>The information you put in here will be kept completely confidential. I may contact you in the future if there is sufficient interest in starting a more intentional community (think: mailing list / email pair-ups / Discord / Slack / whatever the kids are doing these days), but only ever with your permission. Otherwise, this will never become public, nor will your individual responses be seen by anyone who is not me. (With the standard disclaimer that if you say you&amp;#39;re going to hurt yourself or someone else I can&amp;#39;t keep that secret. I don&amp;#39;t think any of the questions here will lead you that way, but my training as a mandated reporter means I instinctively add this caveat.)

Who am I, then, that you should trust me? I&amp;#39;m Shane Liesegang (https://shaneliesegang.com, https://twitter.com/OptimistPanda). I worked in games and adjacent fields for 10+ years (Walt Disney Imagineering, EA [LMNO if that means anything to you], Bethesda [Skyrim, a bit of the Fallouts], Sony [God of War]), but in 2015 I entered the Jesuits on my way to being a Catholic priest. At the moment I&amp;#39;m doing refugee aid work in the Middle East. (Whether you trust me based on any of that is up to you.)

I still love games and care about people who make them and write about them. (Sometimes I even still make / work on games!) Lately I&amp;#39;ve had a few folks reach out to me asking about other Christians in the gamedev world, and sadly, beyond a couple of people, I mostly have just rumors and guesses. I know of and am a part of a few communities that have an intersection of creative folks and Christianity, but am curious to know who else is out there.

I know that &amp;quot;Christian&amp;quot; is a wide net, especially these days. But if you are or have ever thought of yourself as Christian and you are someone who spends their days working on or thinking about games, I&amp;#39;m curious to hear about you.</description>

      <title>The subtleties of Create&amp;#173;Stream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal, part 2: Suppressing the deletion of an unknown HGLOBAL</title>

      <description>Last time, we looked at the easy case of the Create&amp;#173;Stream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal function, where you just hand an HGLOBAL to the stream and wipe your hands of it. The weird case is where you pass fDelete&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;Release = FALSE. For now, let’s look at the case where you pass a null HGLOBAL,</description>

      <title>How to visualize decision tree</title>
      <link>https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html</link>
      <description>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of gradient boosting machines and Random Forests(tm), probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data. Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models. Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn&amp;#39;t find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. So, we&amp;#39;ve created a general package (part of the animl library) for scikit-learn decision tree visualization and model interpretation.</description>

      <title>About Offline First &amp;#183; RxDB</title>
      <link>https://rxdb.info/offline-first.html</link>
      <description>Offline-First is a software paradigm where the software must work as well offline as it does online.
To implement this, you have to store data at the client side, so that your application can still access it when the internet goes away.
This can be either done with complex caching strategies, or by using an offline first database (like RxDB) that stores the data inside of IndexedDb and replicates it from and to the backend in the background. This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.</description>

      <title>What the GNU?</title>
      <link>https://ariadnavigo.xyz/posts/what-the-gnu/</link>
      <description>OK, this is a post I’ve been planning for months, I think? Several past drafts have been injured and killed before I gave birth to this one, the succesful one. So, let’s jump straight into it: I wanna talk about GNU.
GNU. Not the FSF, not RMS… Why are all these three letter acronyms? Are all of these cover operations of some three letter agency? I hope saying that doesn’t get me into any trouble, so you better read my post before I suddenly disappear… Just kidding!</description>

      <description>Papers about programming languages involve complex notations, systems, and proofs. Static PDFs offer little support in understanding such concepts. I describe Nota, a framework for academic papers that uses the browser&amp;#39;s interactive capabilities to support comprehension in context. Nota uses hover effects, tooltips, expandable sections, toggleable explanations, and other interactions to help readers understand a language&amp;#39;s syntax and semantics. I demonstrate the use of Nota by rewriting a PL paper using its primitives, and also by writing this paper in Nota.</description>
