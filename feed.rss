      <title>TypeScript-Go: A 10x Faster TypeScript without .NET but in Go</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/a36cc4df-4dce-47e0-b154-9a4a9e4a7a37</link>
      <description>Recent news came out that Microsoft is working on a new TypeScript compiler written in Go (or golang - whatever you prfer). It promises to be 10x faster than the current compiler that is written - well in TypeScript itself. While this is certainly good news, why isn&amp;#39;t Microsoft betting on .NET and C#?

      <description>In this article I want to share my experience of using search engine consoles, continuing an idea from a recent Telegram post. Maybe this could reduce frustration for someone, reassuring them that they’re not alone - or even save them some time.

      <title>Downtown Doug Brown &amp;#187; Apple’s long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found</title>
      <link>https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/03/apples-long-lost-hidden-recovery-partition-from-1994-has-been-found/</link>
      <description>In my last post about hard drives that go bad over time, I hinted at having rescued a lost piece of obscure Apple software history from an old 160 MB Conner hard drive that had its head stuck in the parked position. This post is going to be all about it. It’s the tale of a tad bit of an obsession, what felt like a hopeless search, and how persistence eventually paid off. There’s still an unsolved mystery too, so I’m hoping others will see this and help to fill in the blanks!</description>

      <title>Career advice in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/career-advice-2025/</link>
      <description>Yesterday, the tj-actions repository, a popular tool used with Github Actions was compromised (for more background read one of these two articles). Watching the infrastructure and security engineering teams at Carta respond, it highlighted to me just how much LLMs can’t meaningfully replace many essential roles of software professionals. However, I’m also reading Jennifer Palkha’s Recoding America, which makes an important point: decision-makers can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. (Or, in this context, remain employed.)</description>

      <description>The internet runs on a lot of things—electricity, servers, cat videos—but when it comes to how web applications communicate, REST has been leading the way for over two decades. But where did REST come from? And how did it go from an academic concept to powering the world’s most significant web services? Let’s dive into the origin and evolution of REST.</description>
