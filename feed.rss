      <title>DevExpress Reports: Localization with Azure Text Translator API</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4gkCl5eOA</link>
      <description>If you’ve watched our first Report Localization-video, you know that v20.1 – set to ship in May 2020 – allows you and your end-users to quickly translate individual reports for global distribution.  In this video, we’ll describe a v20.1 feature we did not have time to document in our first video – Specifically, we’ll describe how you can use Azure Text Translation API and your own custom localization service within the DevExpress Web End-User Report Designer.

      <title>I could do that in a weekend!</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/</link>
      <description>I can't think of a single large software company that doesn't regularly draw internet comments of the form “What do all the employees do? I could build their product myself.” Benjamin Pollack and Jeff Atwood called out people who do that with Stack Overflow. But Stack Overflow is relatively obviously lean, so the general response is something like “oh, sure maybe Stack Overflow is lean, but FooCorp must really be bloated”. And since most people have relatively little visibility into FooCorp, for any given value of FooCorp, that sounds like a plausible statement. After all, what product could possible require hundreds, or even thousands of engineers?</description>

      <title>INotifyPropertyChanged with C# 9.0 Source Generators</title>
      <link>https://jaylee.org/archive/2020/04/29/notify-property-changed-with-rosyln-generators.html</link>
      <description>In a design meeting far, far away, source generators were designed to be part of C# 6.0, but sadly never came to be. At the time, wanting that source generation feature pretty badly, I went on implementing the specification which later became Uno.SourceGeneration, and it turns out it was the right decision to stick with a very similar API.

I could port the INotifyPropertyChanged (INPC) generator I built a while back that uses Uno.SourceGeneration package, convert it to use Roslyn’s shiny new C# 9.0 feature in a matter of minutes. Amazing!

      <title>To Microservices and Back Again - Why Segment Went Back to a Monolith </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/</link>
      <description>When Segment moved to a microservices architecture, they gained environmental isolation, but at a cost of higher operational overhead. Three years later, the costs were too high, and the team migrated back to a monolith. At QCon London, Alexandra Noonan told the cautionary tale, and emphasized the importance of evaluating trade-offs in architectural decisions.</description>

      <title>C# interop with C/C++ and Rust in WebAssembly - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/c-interop-with-c-c-and-rust-in-webassembly/</link>
      <description>Having the ability to call code written in other languages is increasingly important, as there are many very useful libraries that are getting ported over to WebAssembly. In .NET, the common defined way for doing interop is P/Invoke and DllImport, and .NET for WebAssembly has support for it in the form of static linking of LLVM Bitcode object files. In this article, I will walk through how to call some simple C/C++ and Rust code from C# in a WebAssembly app. In the general .NET sense, P/Invoke was built to perform dynamic linking with Windows PE Dlls, but has been extended in mono to allow for static linking. This technique is also used by mono on iOS to call native code, and allows for a single executable package to contain the code to execute the application. This is what is used for the demos in this article. Setting up the C# WebAssembly project First let’s create create a .NET WebAssembly app, using the Uno WebAssembly Bootstrapper. Note that macOS is not yet supported for the static linking scenario, and that on Windows 10 you’ll need to have WSL installed. Create a .NET Standard 2.0 Library in Visual Studio for Windows …</description>

      <description>In this third part of our deeper look at 3D game rendering, we'll be focusing what can happen to the 3D world after the vertex processing has done and the scene has been rasterized. The majority of the visual effects seen in games today are down to the clever use of textures -- without them, games would dull and lifeless. So let's get dive in and see how this all works!</description>
