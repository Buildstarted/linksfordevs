Imagine you&amp;#39;re crafting the perfect symphony—different instruments contributing to a harmonious whole without drowning each other out. This is what Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) brings to your codebase. By isolating secondary concerns like logging, security, and exception handling, AOP ensures your core business logic remains pristine and focused.

      <title>An eSIM manager for Mobile Linux</title>
      <link>https://lucaweiss.eu/post/2024-06-24-esim-manager-for-mobile-linux/</link>
      <description>For a while eSIM management on Mobile Linux, such as postmarketOS, was just a dream. Now it’s real!
Background Nowadays many smartphones and other devices have a so-called eSIM - or eUICC - built-in to the device. This eSIM is essentially a chip on the PCB of the device that allows an end user to download a SIM profile - essentially all the data of a SIM card - to said chip and then the modem of the device can use that chip the same way as it would use any physical SIM card you insert.</description>

      <description>People using these things we build don&amp;#39;t care about our good intentions, or how well the thing works for others. They just want the thing to work for them.</description>

      <title>Why Test? | Jonathan&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://jonathan-frere.com/posts/why-test/</link>
      <description>Why do you write tests?
I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this question a lot recently. I’ve been trying to motivate some teammates that tests are worth writing. But I&amp;amp;rsquo;m going to convince them of that, I need to be able to answer that question for myself, right?
Tests sometimes get portrayed as one of the chores of software development. As a new developer, that’s how I saw tests for a long time: something I did because it was what I was told to do — besides, if I got the coverage to 100%, I got a little green checkbox to put on my README.</description>

      <title>Why strand.spreen.co is Now Offline</title>
      <link>https://spreen.co/posts/2024-06-20-strand/</link>
      <description>Thank you for navigating to strand.spreen.co
I appreciate everyone who got some use out of this archive for the short time it existed. The TL;DR of this post is: NYT sent me a copyright notice that I will comply with. The website is now shut down. Keep on reading for a bit of a backstory, drama, and some learnings.</description>
