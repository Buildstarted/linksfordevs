      <description>Government operatives used NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to hack 36 personal phones belonging to journalists, producers, anchors, and executives at Al Jazeera. The journalists were hacked by four Pegasus operators, including one operator MONARCHY that we attribute to Saudi Arabia, and one operator SNEAKY KESTREL that we attribute to the United Arab Emirates.</description>

      <title>&amp;#187; Lode Runner The Digital Antiquarian</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2020/12/lode-runner/</link>
      <description>It’s always been a bit of a balancing act to decide which games I write about in detail here — a matter of balancing my level of personal interest in each candidate against its historical importance. In the early years of this project especially, when I still saw it as focusing almost exclusively on narrative-oriented games, I passed over some worthy candidates because I considered them somewhat out of scope. And now, needless to say, I regret some of those omissions.</description>

      <title>You&amp;#39;re Missing Out If You Don&amp;#39;t Write Weekly Digests</title>
      <link>https://eyeofthesquid.com/posts/write-weekly-digests/</link>
      <description>Summary A scheduling faux-pas earlier this year led to the accidental discovery of a best practice that has improved knowledge sharing, discussion, and documentation at thredUP while requiring minimal time investment.
An Odd Handoff I work on the thredUP merch-science team as Director of Engineering. The merch-science team has always been good about collaboration between product leaders and engineering to ensure that we are fully covered in the case of vacations, leaves of absence, and departures.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual communication and intimidation</title>
      <link>https://dandanua.github.io/posts/counterfactual-communication-and-intimidation/</link>
      <description>A few years ago a remarkable event happened. A team of physicists performed an experiment of counterfactual communication. Using the quantum properties of light, they were able to transmit information without sending photon particles to the receiver. This was never performed before or observed in nature. We see objects because reflected photons drop on our retina and start chemical reactions. In optical fibers information is carried by photons that ended up on the receiver side.</description>

      <description>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.</description>

      <title>Kira McLean | How To Set Up Your Own Nextcloud Server</title>
      <link>https://kiramclean.com/blog/how-to-set-up-your-own-nextcloud-server/</link>
      <description>One of my goals for 2020 was to stop using Google&amp;#39;s products. There are a lot of reasons why, but that&amp;#39;s not the point of this post. I found out about Nextcloud last month and it turns out it&amp;#39;s a great replacement for a lot of Google. I don&amp;#39;t actually use all of its features, but I&amp;#39;ve migrated my calendar, reminders, contacts, bookmarks, video calls, photos, and news feeds and I&amp;#39;m really happy with it so far.</description>
