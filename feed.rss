      <link>https://ianthehenry.com/posts/bauble/building-bauble/</link>
      <description>I made something that I think is pretty neat, and I want to tell you about it.


This is a little hot air balloon made out of alternating layers of brass and bronze that stack together with these angled facets:


It’s 3D printed, sort of, but it really is solid metal – it’s not a metallic filament. It’s made by “lost wax casting,” where you 3D print a model out of resin, then pack it in plaster, and then once the plaster dries you melt out the resin and fill the void with molten–
You know what? This is neat, but this actually isn’t what I wanted to tell you about.</description>

      <title>the better lesson</title>
      <link>https://shyamal.me/blog/better-lesson/</link>
      <description>We still underestimate how much we can squeeze out of large language models simply by giving them more time to think. Consider the lessons from AlphaGo, where progress emerged not from intricate hand-engineered features but from scaling simple methods, applying massive search at inference, and integrating deep reinforcement learning. As the “bitter lesson” in AI suggests, what often matters most is scaling what works. The simple insight here is that deep learning - combined with aligned scaling - tends to outperform more delicate approaches. We don’t need intricate architectures as much as we need more compute, data, and ways to let the model think longer and integrate well with the environment.</description>
