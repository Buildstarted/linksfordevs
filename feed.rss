      <description>Business processes ensure uniformity and help catch errors. The people who created the process did so with the most noble of intentions, but secretly, every process subconsciously wants to fail. It just doesn’t know it yet. I got a bug saying that my widget does not meet XYZ requirements,</description>

      <title>People mistake the internet’s knowledge for their own</title>
      <link>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/43/e2105061118</link>
      <description>In the current digital age, people are constantly connected to online information. The present research provides evidence that on-demand access to external information, enabled by the internet and search engines like Google, blurs the boundaries between internal and external knowledge, causing people to believe they could—or did—remember what they actually just found. Using Google to answer general knowledge questions artificially inflates peoples’ confidence in their own ability to remember and process information and leads to erroneously optimistic predictions regarding how much they will know without the internet. When information is at our fingertips, we may mistakenly believe that it originated from inside our heads.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#39;s a debate to be had about whether using JavaScript or TypeScript leads to better outcomes when building a project. The introduction of using JSDoc annotations to type a JavaScript codebase introduces a new dynamic to this discussion.
