      <description>The European Commission is conducting an in-depth investigation of the Google/Fitbit deal. A static, conventional view would suggest limited issues from a merger of complements. Yet, as this column outlines, unprecedented concerns arise when one sees that allowing for Fitbit’s data gathering capabilities to be put in Google’s hands creates major risks of “platform</description>

      <link>https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2020/09/30/transitioning-the-dapr-project-to-open-governance</link>
      <description>About one year ago, we released Dapr as an open source project to enable developers to build event-based, distributed applications using a wide variety of different programming languages and platforms. Since the initial release, we have seen tremendous adoption of the project by developers worldwide. We are particularly excited by the growth in collaboration, with over 500 individual contributors who write code, design and review feature proposals, create issues, and author documentation.</description>

Let’s start with the lowest-level Windows Runtime iterator-ish thing: The IIterator&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, which represents a cursor in a collection.

      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/provisioning-aws-resources-using-cdk-azure-devops/</link>
      <description>Introduction First of all let me tell you that I’m huge proponent of Terraform as a framework for defining infrastructure in code. One of the things that I like most about Terraform is that not only every major cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) offers their own provider but each day more and more companies are starting to offer their own Terraform providers, and those are great news because with Terraform I can create almost any cloud infrastructure that I want and also a huge array of varied resources such as: VMware vSphere Virtual Machines, RabbitMq Queues, Grafana dashboards amongst many many others.</description>

      <title>New features in the fish shell</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/832429/5a786cc0fed26353/</link>
      <description>Fish (the &amp;quot;friendly interactive
shell&amp;quot;) has
the explicit goal of being 
more user-friendly than other shells.
It features a modern command-line interface with syntax highlighting, tab
completion, and auto-suggestions out of the box
(all with no configuration required). 
Unlike many of its competitors, it doesn&amp;#39;t care
about being POSIX-compliant but attempts to blaze its own path.  Since our
last 
look at the project, way back in 2013, it
has seen lots of new releases with features, bug fixes, and refinements
aimed at 
appealing to a wide range of users. Some of the biggest additions landed in the
3.0 release, but
we will also describe some other notable changes from version 2.1 up through
latest version.</description>

      <title>It Is Never a Compiler Bug Until It Is</title>
      <link>http://r6.ca/blog/20200929T023701Z.html</link>
      <description>Last week I was trying to add some testing code to libsecp256k1 and I was pulling out my hair trying to get it to work.
No amount of printf was working to illuminate what I was doing wrong.
Finally, out of desperation, I thought I would do a quick check to see if there are any compiler bugs related to memcmp, and lo and behold, I found GCC bug #95189: memcmp being wrongly stripped like strcmp.</description>
