      <title>Progress on no-GIL CPython</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/947138/</link>
      <description>Back at the end of July, the Python steering council announced
its intention to approve the proposal to make the global interpreter lock
(GIL) optional over the next few Python releases.  The details of that
acceptance are still being decided on, but work on the feature is
proceeding—in discussion form at least.  Beyond that, though, there are
efforts underway to solve that hardest of problems in computer
science, naming, for the no-GIL version.</description>

      <title>CQRS Pattern With MediatR</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/cqrs-pattern-with-mediatr</link>
      <description>Today I want to show you how to use the CQRS pattern to build fast and scalable applications. The CQRS pattern separates the writes and reads in the application. This separation can be logical or physical and has many benefits. I&amp;#39;m also going to show you how to implement CQRS in your application using MediatR.</description>

      <description>We will analyze all the root causes for cursor jumps when handling inputs.
Since the responsibility of this problem is mixed between the browsers and React, I&amp;#39;ve showcased examples in vanilla JS, React, and mentioned other frameworks too.

Warning, there will be a deep dive into React&amp;#39;s internals.</description>

      <description>Two years ago Cloudflare released an API for creating servers in JavaScript. Now every modern JavaScript cloud provider — Deno, Vercel, Bun, Netlify, Fastly, Lagon — supports it. If you’ve written a serverless JavaScript API in the last two years, you likely know it well.</description>

      <title>Command Line 802.11 Monitor Mode on macOS Sonoma (14.0) – nuxx.net</title>
      <link>https://nuxx.net/blog/2023/10/20/command-line-802-11-monitor-mode-on-macos-sonoma-14-0/</link>
      <description>Because it supports monitor mode, a Macbook with the built-in WiFi adapter is one of the simplest ways to grab packets off the air. It’s not the most robust, but often all I need to do is grab data from a couple devices I’m near on a known channel, so fancy antennas and channel hopping and whatnot is overkill; I just need to grab packets. Using the Sniffer built into the Wireless Diagnostics captures in Monitor Mode has been fairly easy for a while, but I was stuck using the GUI.</description>

      <title>Encrypted traffic interception on Hetzner and Linode targeting the largest Russian XMPP (Jabber) messaging service —</title>
      <link>https://notes.valdikss.org.ru/jabber.ru-mitm/</link>
      <description>TL;DR: we have discovered XMPP (Jabber) instant messaging protocol encrypted TLS connection wiretapping (Man-in-the-Middle attack) of jabber.ru (aka xmpp.ru) service’s servers on Hetzner and Linode hosting providers in Germany.
The attacker has issued several new TLS certificates using Let’s Encrypt service which were used to hijack encrypted STARTTLS connections on port 5222 using transparent MiTM proxy. The attack was discovered due to expiration of one of the MiTM certificates, which haven’t been reissued.
There are no indications of the server breach or spoofing attacks on the network segment, quite the contrary: the traffic redirection has been configured on the hosting provider network.
The wiretapping may have lasted for up to 6 months overall (90 days confirmed). We believe this is lawful interception Hetzner and Linode were forced to setup.</description>
