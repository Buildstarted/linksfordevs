      <title>C# interop with C/C++ and Rust in WebAssembly - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/c-interop-with-c-c-and-rust-in-webassembly/</link>
      <description>Having the ability to call code written in other languages is increasingly important, as there are many very useful libraries that are getting ported over to WebAssembly. In .NET, the common defined way for doing interop is P/Invoke and DllImport, and .NET for WebAssembly has support for it in the form of static linking of LLVM Bitcode object files. In this article, I will walk through how to call some simple C/C++ and Rust code from C# in a WebAssembly app. In the general .NET sense, P/Invoke was built to perform dynamic linking with Windows PE Dlls, but has been extended in mono to allow for static linking. This technique is also used by mono on iOS to call native code, and allows for a single executable package to contain the code to execute the application. This is what is used for the demos in this article. Setting up the C# WebAssembly project First let’s create create a .NET WebAssembly app, using the Uno WebAssembly Bootstrapper. Note that macOS is not yet supported for the static linking scenario, and that on Windows 10 you’ll need to have WSL installed. Create a .NET Standard 2.0 Library in Visual Studio for Windows …</description>

      <description>I want to do $THING. Normally I do my hacking in Python, which is okay but has lots of frustrations. My friends tell me $LANGUAGE is better for doing $THING. After going through the online tutorial, I can see why. Maybe I’ll try $LANGUAGE for this project! Just a few things I need to figure out first:
 How do I install it? The docs say brew install, but I’m on Windows.</description>

      <link>https://www.techspot.com/article/1916-how-to-3d-rendering-texturing/</link>
      <description>In this third part of our deeper look at 3D game rendering, we'll be focusing what can happen to the 3D world after the vertex processing has done and the scene has been rasterized. The majority of the visual effects seen in games today are down to the clever use of textures -- without them, games would dull and lifeless. So let's get dive in and see how this all works!</description>

      <title>UTS #51: Unicode Emoji</title>
      <link>http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Sorting</link>
      <description>This document defines the structure of Unicode emoji characters and
			sequences, and provides data to support that structure, such as which
			characters are considered to be emoji, which emoji should be displayed by
			default with a text style versus an emoji style, and which can be
			displayed with a variety of skin tones.
			It also provides design guidelines for improving the interoperability of
			emoji characters across platforms and implementations.</description>
