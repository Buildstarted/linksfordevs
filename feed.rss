      <title>Health Checking</title>
      <link>https://blog.eightnoteight.dev/p/health-checking</link>
      <description>Systems could fail due to several unexpected failures, degraded hardware suddenly showing higher latency, partial network disruption to some specific instances, or network cable cut-off etc.,… Health checking, in principle, handles such unexpected localised failures that happen to particular containers or VMs among the entire cluster by removing them from the workload. This way total error rate in the cluster can be reduced.</description>

      <description>Laravel 10 is making the headlines these days. However, many apps are stuck in older versions, or at least still use the syntax and methods of older releases. One of the most significant changes introduced in Laravel 9 is the syntax for accessors and...</description>

      <title>A new series of videos on zero-knowledge proof composition and recursion (part 1)</title>
      <link>https://cryptologie.net/article/587/a-new-series-of-videos-on-zero-knowledge-proof-composition-and-recursion-part-1/</link>
      <description>I introduced Plonk in a series of 12 videos here. That was almost a year and half ago! So I&amp;#39;m back with more :) 
In this new series of videos I will explain how proof composition and recursion work with different schemes. Spoiler: we&amp;#39;ll talk about Sangria, Nova, PCD, IVC, BCTV14 and Halo (and perhaps more if more comes up as I record these).
Here&amp;#39;s the first one:

      <link>https://embeddeddisco.com/</link>
      <description>EmbeddedDisco is a modern protocol and a cryptographic library in C. It offers different ways of encrypting communications, as well as different cryptographic primitives for all of an application&amp;#39;s needs. It targets simplicity and minimalism, with around 1,000 lines-of-code, not a single malloc and a design based solely on the well-accepted SHA-3 and Curve25519 cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>Real-World Cryptography, a bit more than a year later</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/586/real-world-cryptography-a-bit-more-than-a-year-later/</link>
      <description>source: redbubble

Three years ago, in the middle of writing my book Real-World Cryptography, I wrote about Why I&amp;#39;m writing a book on cryptography. I believed there was a market of engineers (and researchers) that was not served by the current offerings. There ought to be something more approachable, with less equations and theory and history, with more diagrams, and including advanced topics li ...</description>
