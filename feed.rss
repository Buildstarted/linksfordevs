      <title>On Voice Coding</title>
      <link>https://dusty.phillips.codes/2020/02/15/on-voice-coding/</link>
      <description>I have had repetitive stress injury (RSI) flareups on and off for many years. I’ve kept them under control mostly through use of an Kinesis Advantage ergonomic keyboard that I’ve had for fifteen years. However, several months ago, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome and instructed to avoid typing if at all possible.
I make my living programming and writing. My hobbies are programming and writing.
The first thing I had to do was completely scrap two book projects.</description>
