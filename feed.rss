      <title>Unlocking Code Modularity  The Power of Simple Design #programming #coding #dotnet</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=jkb22ALN2lM</link>
      <description>Ports and adapters, clean architecture, hexagonal architecture. Call it whatever you want it doesn't have to mean unneccessary abstractions and misdirection in your code base.

It's simple, it's clean. And it ensures your code stays modular and the application and infrastructure concerns of your application say seperate.

      <title>I Removed MediatR â€“ Building Your Own CQRS Handlers in .NET</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=j1OUToRyVHc</link>
      <description>Get the free Clean Architecture template: https://dub.sh/ca-template
Want to master Clean Architecture? Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ
Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt

You've probably heardâ€”MediatR is going commercial.

If you're using it in your Clean Architecture template (like I did), it might be time to explore alternatives. In this video, Iâ€™ll walk you through a full MediatR-free CQRS implementation using custom `ICommand`, `IQuery`, and handler interfaces.

âœ… Weâ€™ll cover:
- Why I decided to remove MediatR
- How to build your own CQRS abstractions
- Replacing ISender with explicit handler injection
- Manual DI vs automatic scanning using [Scrutor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scrutor)
- Fully working Command &amp; Query pipeline without third-party libraries

You'll see how to:
- Refactor a .NET API endpoint from MediatR to your own handler
- Register handlers manually and automatically
- Handle generic result types for commands and queries

ðŸ‘‰ Want to skip ahead and use the updated template?

      <description>Machine learning (ML) has the potential to advance the state of the
art in technical writing. No, Iâ€™m not talking about text generation models
like Claude, Gemini, LLaMa, GPT, etc. The ML technology that might end up
having the biggest impact on technical writing is embeddings.</description>
