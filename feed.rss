      <description>Generated with the Midjourney bot &amp;quot;An internet connected house&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m not overly-eager to automate my whole home. Leaving aside security concerns, it&amp;#39;s also really, really expensive. However, there are some small quality-of-life things I&amp;#39;ve added over time or kept over the years that I&amp;#39;ve found very helpful. It&amp;#39;s an evolving thing and there are a few &amp;quot;smart home&amp;quot; objects I would never, ever touch (internet connected &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; deadlocks anyone?</description>

      <title>Layoffs, Anxiety and Trust</title>
      <link>https://www.mikemcbrideonline.com/2023/02/layoffs-anxiety-and-trust/</link>
      <description>Ultimately this is what will define your culture and your employee engagement. Do your actions match your words? It&amp;#39;s not enough to say you care about mental health, diversity, or developing the people who work for you. You had better put something behind that. If you&amp;#39;ve had layoffs recently, don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to believe that you care about these things on your words alone. Those layoffs told everyone in the organization that they were expendable. They could be next, and the only thing that truly matters is how much they make for you. If you care about their growth, wellbeing and being a diverse company, you had better show up with something other than words.</description>

      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/christian-wenz-aspnet-core-security-episode-233</link>
      <description>Christian Wenz works as a consultant, trainer, and author with a focus on web technologies and is the author or co-author of over 100 computer books. He regularly contributes to various IT magazines and speaks at conferences around the globe. Christian holds a &amp;quot;Diplom&amp;quot; (the German equivalent of a master’s degree) in Computer Sciences, and one in Business Informatics. In his day job, he is one of the founders of the web agency Arrabiata Solutions () with offices in Munich, Germany, and in London, UK. He also frequently works with development teams to make their applications better performing, more secure, and more reliable. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:51] Has Christian really written over 100 computer books? Christian talks about the books and the high points of technology that he has worked in. [7:16] What is the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10 list? [10:33] You always have to be aware that something may go wrong, and have a security mindset. [12:05] Again and again, make sure that you understand the fundamentals of web app security, because eventually, you will make a mistake in your code. [12:30] What is insecure design? [13:43] Christian talks about the enumeration scheme CWE: common weakness enumeration, which basically assigns a number to each risk or attack. [17:00] How should people be logging into their web sessions now with .NET7? [18:31] The major mistake you can make these days is to write your own authentication mechanism. [23:57] What is Christian’s favorite mechanism today for securing HTTP web services? [31:05] What are some of the tools Christian always reaches for, and how do we differentiate between static auditing and dynamically auditing an application? &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:     — New Video Podcast!

      <title>A Guide to Reclaim Our Attention</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/a-guide-to-reclaim-our-attention/</link>
      <description>We’re losing our capacity to focus.
When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, little we knew how much that would change the world, it was the first step towards the ubiquity of smartphones. There was a premonitory phrase from Steve Jobs: “iPhone is like having your life in your pocket”.[1]
iPhone presentation in 2007
And we loved it.
We’ve embraced smartphones to the point where it’s hard to find someone who doesn’t own one, but we have yet to consider the consequences.</description>

      <link>https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html</link>
      <description>They seem harmless enough, 52 thin slices of laminated cardboard with colorful designs printed on their sides.  Yet, as another illustration of the mantra that complexity begins from the most simple systems, the number of variations that these 52 cards can produce is virtually endless.  The richness of most playing card games owes itself to this fact.</description>

      <title>Caveat Implementor! Key Recovery Attacks on MEGA</title>
      <link>https://mega-caveat.github.io/</link>
      <description>MEGA is a large-scale cloud storage and communication platform that aims to provide end-to-end encryption for stored data. 
                Recent work by Backendal, Haller and Paterson invalidated these security claims by showing practical attacks against MEGA that could be mounted by the MEGA service provider. 
                In response, the MEGA developers added lightweight sanity checks on the user RSA private keys used in MEGA, sufficient to prevent the previous attacks.
                We analysed these new sanity checks and show how they themselves could be exploited to mount novel attacks on MEGA that recover a target user&amp;#39;s RSA private key with only slightly higher attack complexity than the original attacks.</description>

      <title>Word-As-Image for Semantic Typography</title>
      <link>https://wordasimage.github.io/Word-As-Image-Page/</link>
      <description>Our word-as-image illustrations concentrate on changing only the geometry of the letters to
                convey the meaning.
                We deliberately do not change color or texture and do not use embellishments.
                This allows simple, concise, black-and-white designs that convey the semantics clearly.

                We rely on the prior of a pretrained Stable Diffusion model to connect between text and images, and utilize
                the Score Distillation Sampling approach to encourage the appearance of the letter to reflect the
                provided textual concept.

                Given an input word, our method is applied separately for each letter.

                We represent each letter as a closed vectorized shape.</description>

      <title>Word-As-Image for Semantic Typography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01818</link>
      <description>A word-as-image is a semantic typography technique where a word illustration
presents a visualization of the meaning of the word, while also preserving its
readability. We present a method to create word-as-image illustrations
automatically. This task is highly challenging as it requires semantic
understanding of the word and a creative idea of where and how to depict these
semantics in a visually pleasing and legible manner. We rely on the remarkable
ability of recent large pretrained language-vision models to distill textual
concepts visually. We target simple, concise, black-and-white designs that
convey the semantics clearly. We deliberately do not change the color or
texture of the letters and do not use embellishments. Our method optimizes the
outline of each letter to convey the desired concept, guided by a pretrained
Stable Diffusion model. We incorporate additional loss terms to ensure the
legibility of the text and the preservation of the style of the font. We show
high quality and engaging results on numerous examples and compare to
alternative techniques.</description>

      <title>Imperative code is simpler than functional code! No, not at all, but you are more used to it. – planetgeek.ch</title>

      <description>A myth about F# that I hear repeatedly is that imperative code (e.g. loops) is simpler than functional code (e.g. folds). On one hand, simplicity is very subjective. On the other hand, simplicity is mostly determined by familiarity.</description>
