      <description>There&amp;#39;s a cocktail party version of the efficient markets hypothesis I frequently hear that&amp;#39;s basically, &amp;quot;markets enforce efficiency, so it&amp;#39;s not possible that a company can have some major inefficiency and survive&amp;quot;. We&amp;#39;ve previously discussed Marc Andreessen&amp;#39;s quote that tech hiring can&amp;#39;t be inefficient here and here:</description>

      <title>Hamblingreen&amp;#39;s Pinephone Setup</title>
      <link>https://hamblingreen.gitlab.io/2022/03/02/my-pinephone-setup.html</link>
      <description>The Pine64 Pinephone[0] is my first Linux device. It sounds crazy, but I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to use linux for quite a while. I made an effort to switch to FOSS on android, but due to the fact that my phone&amp;#39;s bootloader was locked, I couldn&amp;#39;t install LineageOS. All this time I was aware that the core of my phone, it&amp;#39;s kernel, was closed source and probably out-of-date. This nudged me to research Linux. The more I looked, the more there was to like. At first I tried installing Arch linux on WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux) but this was unsuccessful. I wanted a truly native Linux device, but was unable to afford my own computer. This is where the Pinephone comes in, where I could kill two birds with one stone. Not only would I get a new phone of which I had complete control, but I&amp;#39;d also have a native Linux device. Now, I use my Pinephone as more than a phone. It&amp;#39;s my communicator, my general purpouse computer and my development device. Calling it a phone just doesn&amp;#39;t do this device justice. It&amp;#39;s a desktop computer. One that happens to fit in your pocket. Keeping all this in mind, my usecase is relatively light. I need it for schoolwork, coding and testing programs, web browsing, communication, and video/audio streaming. The reason it can remain as my sole device is because I don&amp;#39;t need to run heavy software like Autodesk. I need to do very basic tasks, and the Pinephone fulfills them and more.</description>
