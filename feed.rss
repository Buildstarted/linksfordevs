For example, &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; are near rhymes because they share similar vowel sounds but end with different consonant sounds.

      <description>Text Interfaces Aren’t Enough The last few months of LLM development have been staggering. It’s been amazing to see how powerful chat-based interfaces, heralded by OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can be.

      <title>The New XOR Problem</title>
      <link>https://blog.wtf.sg/posts/2023-02-03-the-new-xor-problem/</link>
      <description>In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published Perceptrons: An Introduction to Computational Geometry. In it, they showed that a single-layer perceptron cannot compute the XOR function. The main argument relies on linear separability: Perceptrons are linear classifiers, which essentially means drawing a line to separate input that would result in 1 versus 0. You can do it in the OR and AND case, but not XOR.
  Of course, we’re way past that now, neural networks with one hidden layer can solve that problem.</description>

      <description>I’ve been reading a book called The Road Less Stupid. The thesis is that one’s goal in decision making should not be to focus on making more smart choices, but rather fewer stupid ones.</description>

      <title>Recreating ANSI Art from a screenshot</title>
      <link>https://bert.org/2023/02/27/recreating-ansi-art-from-a-screenshot/</link>
      <description>In the early to mid-90s, I ran a BBS out of my bedroom. It wasn’t very popular, but I did have a lot of time on my hands and I spent a lot of that time modding it. Initially, I wrote mods for myself, but eventually I started releasing them to other people. As a teenager, this was the first software that I wrote that other people used. This was my contribution to “the scene” and now my only claim to fame from that time is that I’m part of the final member list of ACiD Productions under BBS Modifications.</description>

      <title>Don&amp;#39;t Keep Ideas to Yourself</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/dont-keep-ideas-to-yourself/</link>
      <description>Naturally, as you grow in your profession, you develop a vision and think about ideas and opportunities you can take to grow and have a more significant impact.
The natural process when these ideas come to mind is to add them to a never-ending to-do list. When I have time, I’ll propose that thing I’ve been thinking about for the last two months, you might think. Sometimes, it’s even worse. You forget about them.</description>
