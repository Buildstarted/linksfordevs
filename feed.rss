      <description>&amp;quot;Luck Surface Area&amp;quot; is a turn of phrase that popped out my mouth during a discussion
episode of TechZing a few months back and
is something I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to write
about ever since but never got around to actually doing. However, thanks to
Lance Jones
who referenced the concept in a recent blog post I have finally been spurred into
action.</description>

      <title>Why Robinhood Disabled Buys but not Sells</title>
      <link>https://stu2b50.dev/posts/why-robinhood-d3580b</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s been enough time for the dust to settle and for Robinhood&amp;#39;s actual reason for halting trades to come out. But the question of why only buys and not sells has not really been answered in detail, and that&amp;#39;s mainly because it&amp;#39;s a pain-in-the-ass and delves deep into how the deposit requirements are calculated by the DTCC for brokers.</description>
