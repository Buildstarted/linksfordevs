      <title>The Computer Genius the Communists Couldn’t Stand</title>
      <link>https://culture.pl/en/article/jacek-karpinski-the-computer-genius-the-communists-couldnt-stand</link>
      <description>In 1970s Poland, Jacek Karpiński created a computer which could conduct a million operations per second and was small enough to fit into a briefcase. At a time when computers were not only slower but also comparable in size to cupboards, this was a remarkable accomplishment. Unfortunately, the communist regime blocked the device.</description>

      <title>Developers want more, more, more: the 2024 results from Stack Overflow’s Annual Developer Survey - Stack Overflow</title>
      <link>https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/24/developers-want-more-more-more-the-2024-results-from-stack-overflow-s-annual-developer-survey/</link>
      <description>In May of 2024, we opened up the 14th annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey to technologists worldwide—and the results are in! This year, technologies such as JavaScript and PostgreSQL remain most popular, Rust and Markdown remain most admired, developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work, and they don’t see AI as a threat to their jobs. Themes we see in this year’s survey results show us that developers are not threatened by AI, and developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work. On the topic of AI, 76% of respondents shared they are using or planning to use AI tools, but only 43% said they trust the accuracy of AI tools and 45% believe AI tools struggle to handle complex tasks.</description>

      <title>&amp;lt;Linear Algebra for Data Science&amp;gt; – Kyunghyun Cho</title>
      <link>https://kyunghyuncho.me/linear-algebra-for-data-science/</link>
      <description>We (Prof. Wanmo Kang and Prof. Kyunghyun Cho) have been discussing over the past few years how we should teach linear algebra to students in this new era of data science and artificial intelligence. Over these discussions, which also led to some research collaboration as well, we realized that (one of the central concepts from linear algebra that is used frequently in practice, if not every day, was) the central concepts from linear algebra invoked frequently in practice, if not every day, were projection, and consequently singular value decomposition (SVD) as well as even less frequently positive definiteness. Unfortunately, we noticed that existing courses on linear algebra often focus much more on the invertibility (or lack thereof), to the point that many concepts are introduced not in the order of their practicality nor usefulness but in the order of the conveniences in mathematical derivations/introductions. We began to wonder a lot whether we can introduce concepts and results in linear algebra in a radically different way.</description>

      <title>Reverse-engineering my speakers&amp;#39; API to get reasonable volume control</title>
      <link>https://jamesbvaughan.com/volume-controller-1/</link>
      <description>I got some fancy new speakers last week.
They’re powered speakers and they have streaming service integrations built in, unlike the 35-year-old passive speakers I’m upgrading from. Overall they’re great! But they’re so loud that it’s difficult to make small volume adjustments within the range of safe volume levels for my apartment.
To solve that, I’m building a custom volume knob for them them that will give me more precise control within the range I like to listen in.</description>

      <title>So, do you actually want to write?</title>
      <link>https://artemis.sh/2024/06/19/do-you-really-want-to-write.html</link>
      <description>There’s this collection of tales about people who use static site generators. The story goes something like this: someone decides they want to be a blogger. So they start researching static site generators, they go down the list, ask some friends, start comparing generators. They learn, wow, there’s a generator in their favorite programming language, and look at all the cool things they can make it do!</description>
