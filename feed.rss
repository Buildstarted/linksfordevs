      <description>Quoth
‚ÄúHow to Become a Hacker‚Äù:
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems waiting out there.

Much more at the original post, including preemptive rebuttals to what
I‚Äôm about to describe. This post is entirely about cataloguing my own
error.
I took this maxim, perhaps, a little too close to heart when I was
starting out as a software guy, 15-odd years ago. This is my
apology to past me. Past me, I apologize.</description>

      <title>Shell we Nix?</title>
      <link>https://abdelrahman.sh/2025/03/shell-we-nix/</link>
      <description>Ever wanted a way to quickly &amp; temporarily install an amusing command-line tool that you read about on the interwebz?
I certainly needed something like that since forever. Every now and then I gotta compress a JPEG using imagemagick, format a markdown file using prettier, or demonstrate to my colleagues that [,,,].length is a valid JavaScript expression, while not having Node.js installed on my machine.
Second best thing I had was Homebrew. I‚Äôd brew install the tool, take it for a spin, and hopefully remember to brew uninstall it afterwards - or else it‚Äôll not only bloat my system, but also slow down brew upgrades even more for the forseable future until I factory-reset my machine next Spring cleaning.</description>

      <title>(Train Time) Recurrence as a necessary condition for General Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://fchaubard.github.io/recurrence.html</link>
      <description>To get to AGI, we need an architecture that is "Turing Complete". And a necessary condition of an architecture to be turing complete is ‚Äúunbounded recurrence/iterations‚Äù. The program needs to be able to call itself as many times as it wants. LLMs / diffusion models are said to be ‚ÄúTuring Complete‚Äù [1]. However, this is only true at test time, NOT during training. Infinite recursion is not possible in just one foreward pass of the model as is done during training. To make this work at all, we need to teacher force explicitly the intermediary goal states (per time step) to achieve any amount of success (CoT for LLMs, and a bit denoised noisy input for diffusion). However, this is much more limiting than most people can comprehend. We train it this way and then cross our fingers and hope that the non-recurrent model can be called in a while true loop and will magically become turing complete.</description>
