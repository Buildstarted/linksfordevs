      <title>3 Things I Wish I Knew Before Becoming An Engineering Manager</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=g6YpZ5o2Zlw</link>
      <description>I was sort of tossed into my role as an engineering manager.

At startups, you end up wearing many hats. I ended up getting one that was way too big for my head, and I&amp;#39;ve been spending the last 12 years trying to get it right.

Being a software engineering manager is an interesting role because it&amp;#39;s much more about enabling others compared to your individual output.

As software engineers move into this role, this can be tricky to learn.

Here are 3 things that I wish I knew before becoming a software engineering manager.

      <description>1. Introduction: Simplifying Caching with Aspect-Oriented Programming in .NET


Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) offers elegant solutions for handling cross-cutting concerns in our .NET applications, such as method caching. In a previous article on GoatReview &amp;#128016;, we explored using Fody to implement a caching aspect. Although powerful, this tool presents significant challenges.

      <title>.NET Conf 2024 - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD3s78pfSk8</link>
      <description>Full agenda: https://dotnetconf.net/agenda

.NET Conf has been a virtual event since the beginning, and this year we’re celebrating our 14th online conference. We always strive to create a world class, engaging, virtual experience for all our attendees no matter where they are. Over the years we&amp;#39;ve expanded our content and our reach. We now draw over 100 thousand live viewers and sponsor hundreds of local events around the world.

Over the course of the three days we provide a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. We have sessions streaming 24/7 between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee parties where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.

      <title>Functors to Monads: A Story of Shapes
</title>
      <link>https://blog.jle.im/entry/functors-to-monads-a-story-of-shapes.html</link>
      <description>For many years now I’ve been using a mental model and intuition that has guided me well for understanding and teaching and using functors, applicatives, monads, and other related Haskell abstractions, as well as for approaching learning new ones. Sometimes when teaching Haskell I talk about this concept and assume everyone already has heard it, but I realize that it’s something universal yet easy to miss depending on how you’re learning it. So, here it is: how I understand the Functor and other related abstractions and free constructions in Haskell. The crux is this: instead of thinking about what fmap changes, ask: what does fmap keep constant? This isn’t a rigorous understanding and isn’t going to explain every aspect about every Functor, and will probably only be useful if you already know a little bit about Functors in Haskell. But it’s a nice intuition trick that has yet to majorly mislead me.</description>

      <title>The smallest (useful) HTTP responses possible</title>
      <link>https://jamesbvaughan.com/small-http/</link>
      <description>I recently did a little experiment to see how small (in bytes) I could make useful valid HTTP responses for a particular use case.
Background On my homepage, I have a little feature where I display the names of the last song I listened to and the last movie I watched. I’ve implemented that via a bit of JavaScript that fetches that information from a pair of Lambda functions that make requests to Last.</description>

      <description>It turns out the review apps are fundamentally incompatible with short-lived branches. We prefer to use feature flags.</description>
