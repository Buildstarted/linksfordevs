This week we fix up the collision code to make trains all play nicely with each other and even do adorable little zipper merges, but we also find some bugs in the train movement code which will be a nightmare to fix. So an ominous future awaits!</description>

      <description>Before I started doing research, I saw SAT solvers as academically interesting but without practical uses ouside of other academic applications. I've since then changed my mind, and I want to change yours, because modern SAT solvers are neat, fast and almost criminally underused by the industry.</description>

      <title>Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14545</link>
      <description>Deep neural network (DNN) is an indispensable machine learning tool for
achieving human-level performance on many learning tasks. Yet, due to its
black-box nature, it is inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the
input data drive the decisions of the network. There are various real-world
scenarios in which humans need to make actionable decisions based on the output
DNNs. Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains, such as
legislation, law enforcement, etc. It is important that the humans making
high-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by
combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the
deployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are
legally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN
technology is being developed, the development of new methods and studies on
explaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active
research field. A practitioner beginning to study explainable deep learning may
be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the field is taking.
This complexity is further exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in
defining what it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning
system and to evaluate a system's "ability to explain". To alleviate this
problem, this article offers a "field guide" to deep learning explainability
for those uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of
a deep learning system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii)
places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research
areas, and iii) introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of
foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is
designed as an easy-to-digest starting point for those just embarking in the
field.</description>

      <title>Remote Debugging for Azure Functions Can Be a Breeze | Ozcode</title>
      <link>https://oz-code.com/blog/azure/remote-debugging-azure-functions-breeze</link>
      <description>Serverless architectures are gaining traction in the software industry, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see them rise on a similar curve that we have seen with microservices. But the ephemeral nature of these short-lived units of execution makes it very difficult to debug them. How do you debug code that only throws an exception under very special circumstances, and then disappears?</description>

      <title>Removing xaml.cs with C# Source Generators - Michael Esteves</title>

      <description>When creating a Xamarin Forms solution with an MVVM framework such as Prism, the view’s backing xaml.cs files are boilerplate. Our application’s logic lives in our view models and ideally their should be no code in the view’s cs file. However if you try deleting them the world breaks and MSBuild has a tantrum.

        The Five Most Likely Explanations for Long Delayed Echoes
       - Department of Physics</title>
      <link>https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/sverre/articles/lde.html</link>
      <description>Radio waves travel so fast that most people consider them to reach their destination instantaneously. Perhaps the only exception is a TV newscast with a live interview to another continent. The connection via a geostationary satellite gives a delay of about half a second from the end of a question to the start of the response. Still, much longer delays have been experienced from the beginning of the radio era. Such echoes occur very seldom and are called long delayed echoes (LDE).

      <title>Making rust as fast as go</title>
      <link>https://www.christianfscott.com/making-rust-as-fast-as-go/</link>
      <description>Update: as some keen HN commenters have pointed out, it looks like the rust program is not actually equivalent to the go program. The go program parses the string once, while the rust program parses it repeatedly inside every loop. It’s quite late in Sydney as I write this so I’m not up for a fix right now, but this post is probably Fake News. The perf gains from jemalloc are real, but it’s likely not the allocators fault.</description>
