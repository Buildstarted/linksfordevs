      <description>This was going to be a post about using COM Server activation in a WinAppSdk application to interact with Click to Do. However, since there’s currently a major regression in the dev channel of the Windows insider builds (reported here, here and here), which prevents Visual Studio from debugging any applications, that’ll have to wait. ...

      <title>Chess Principles</title>
      <link>https://www.mahdikarimi.com/blog/chess-principles/</link>
      <description>While playing chess, I discovered some key anecdotes that struck me as fundamental. What’s fascinating about these principles is that if you stick to them, even without knowing every detail (openings and gambits), your opponent only needs to make two or three mistakes for you to win the game.
Develop your minor pieces as early as possible, putting them on good squares The winner of the chess opening is the person who better controls the center (via pawns or other minor pieces) after going into the middle game phase.</description>

Let's not get into why I'm an idiot; let's just accept that I have my peculiarities and you have yours. My idiocy is a quest to make sure all my portable electronics can recharge using USB-C.  Modern smartwatches are tiny and they do a lot. As a consequence, their battery life is generally poor. The industry's…</description>

      <title>sudo bash isn't a security issue (on Linux)</title>
      <link>https://yawn.io/posts/curl-bash/</link>
      <description>When I want to try out a new tool and its “Getting Started” page kicks off with
curl https://thingy.dev/install.sh | sudo bash, I usually turn
360° and walk away1. It’s not worth it.
But this is not because I’m worried about security. In fact I don’t think
there’s any real security issue with the curl | sudo bash here.
To understand why, let’s start by considering what happens if we drop this sudo.
Is curl | sudo bash more of a security risk than plain curl | bash? I don’t
think so, because there’s no significant security boundary between users on
Linux. There are two reasons for this:</description>
