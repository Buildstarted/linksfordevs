      <title>A year of funded FreeBSD</title>
      <link>https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2025-06-06-A-year-of-funded-FreeBSD.html</link>
      <description>I've been maintaining
FreeBSD on the
Amazon EC2 platform ever since I
first got it booting in 2010, but in
November
2023 I added to my responsibilities the role of FreeBSD release
engineering lead — just in time to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 14.0, although Glen Barber did all the release engineering work for
that release.  While I receive a small amount of funding from
Antithesis and from my
FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon, it
rapidly became clear that my release engineering duties were competing
with — in fact, out-competing — FreeBSD/EC2 for my available
FreeBSD volunteer hours: In addition to my long list of "features to
implement" stagnating, I had increasingly been saying "huh that's weird...
oh well, no time to investigate that now".  In short, by early 2024 I was
becoming increasingly concerned that I was not in a position to be a good
"owner" of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform.</description>
