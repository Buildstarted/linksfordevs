      <title>MAP_SHARED and RSS/SHR</title>
      <link>https://jack.culhane.ie/posts/mmap_shr_memory/</link>
      <description>Recently we were debugging a memory leak on an experimental debugging branch.
It turned out to be a false alarm due to adding tokio-console to a component to debug something.
However, while investigating we noticed a higher than expected RES / SHR reported by htop on another server, that was not on the tokio console branch.
We were using shared memory / mmap queues for communicating between two processes.
These mmaps are reported in RSS (resident set size) and also in SHR (shared memory).</description>

      <title>On Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://ycao.top/posts/on-programming-languages/</link>
      <description>While it is true that most of the time while developing software, we just pick either C++, Java, Python, etc. and start coding simply because A these languages are already well-established and have a lot of libraries and B we are already familiar with them. Yet new languages still emerge from time to time, such as Rust, TypeScript, and Julia, which are happliy adopted (and hated) by developers. But few have thought about what are we actually creating.</description>

      <title>Better &amp;amp; Faster Large Language Models via Multi-token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19737</link>
      <description>Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.</description>
