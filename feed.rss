      <title>Why Putting Solar Canopies on Parking Lots Is a Smart Green Move</title>
      <link>https://e360.yale.edu/features/putting-solar-panels-atop-parking-lots-a-green-energy-solution</link>
      <description>Solar farms are proliferating on undeveloped land, often harming ecosystems. But placing solar canopies on large parking lots offers a host of advantages — making use of land that is already cleared, producing electricity close to those who need it, and even shading cars.</description>

      <title>Microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms: a double-blind placebo-controlled study - Translational Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-02039-0</link>
      <description>The use of low sub-perceptual doses of psychedelics (“microdosing”) has gained popularity in recent years. Although anecdotal reports claim multiple benefits associated with this practice, the lack of placebo-controlled studies severely limits our knowledge of microdosing and its effects. Moreover, research conducted in standard laboratory settings could fail to capture the motivation of individuals engaged or planning to engage in microdosing protocols, thus underestimating the likelihood of positive effects on creativity and cognitive function. We recruited 34 individuals starting to microdose with psilocybin mushrooms (Psilocybe cubensis), one of the materials most frequently used for this purpose. Following a double-blind placebo-controlled experimental design, we investigated the acute and short-term effects of 0.5 g of dried mushrooms on subjective experience, behavior, creativity (divergent and convergent thinking), perception, cognition, and brain activity. The reported acute effects were significantly more intense for the active dose compared to the placebo, but only for participants who correctly identified their experimental condition. These changes were accompanied by reduced EEG power in the theta band, together with preserved levels of Lempel-Ziv broadband signal complexity. For all other measurements there was no effect of microdosing except for few small changes towards cognitive impairment. According to our findings, low doses of psilocybin mushrooms can result in noticeable subjective effects and altered EEG rhythms, but without evidence to support enhanced well-being, creativity and cognitive function. We conclude that expectation underlies at least some of the anecdotal benefits attributed to microdosing with psilocybin mushrooms.</description>

      <title>How To Combine Video Game Genres</title>
      <link>https://yt.artemislena.eu/H63Bqex1Urs</link>

Great video games can come from combining genres - but getting the mix right isn&amp;#39;t easy. In this video we&amp;#39;ll explore the three main methods for merging genres, and look at the problems - and solutions - of each approach.

      <description>I created Papers, Please in 2013 specifically for desktop computers with mouse control. Now, here, in 2022, desktop computers no longer exist and all computing is done via handheld mobile telephone. Time to update this dinosaur.
These thousands of words and megabytes of images will cover some bits of porting the game from big desktop to little phone. As a winking throwback to days past, this is a big dump of text and inline img tags instead of exciting splashes of quick-cut video.</description>

      <title>Running your CI builds without the server</title>
      <link>https://blog.djinn-ci.com/showcase/2022/08/06/running-your-ci-builds-without-the-server/</link>
      <description>Perhaps the one feature that sets Djinn CI out from other CI platforms is the
fact that is has an offline runner.
The offline runner allows for CI builds to be run without having to send them
to the server. There are some limitations around this, of course, but it
provides a useful mechanism for sanity checking build manifests, testing custom
images, and for building software without the need for a CI server.</description>

      <title>Hosting a Minecraft server without extra hardware</title>
      <link>https://siraben.dev/2022/08/01/tailscale-iptables.html</link>
      <description>The problem I want to play Minecraft with my friends, and I already have a server exposed to the internet. However, my server is severely underpowered and is unable to run a Minecraft server instance. On the other hand, I have a spare beefy laptop that can easily handle the load, but port-forwarding is not possible. Both the server and the laptop are on my Tailscale network. Could I somehow leverage all of this to spin up a Minecraft server with a public IP? The answer was yes—and I was surprised at how easy it all was. As a plus, the server is very playable and the latency was better than trying out random “free hosting” services.</description>

      <title>The bizzare world of parsing dates in Spark 2</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonas.earth/posts/bizzare-dates-in-spark2/</link>
      <description>Note: I originally tweeted this into the void
Dates are famously one of the easiest things in software engineering, but Spark 2 added a cherry on the top.
The numbers are off… but just slightly. When I first stumbled across this it wasn’t one of the bugs that just scream in your face - it was subtle. Something didn’t add up, and after a lot of digging it became clear that things didn’t add up around the year mark - repeatedly, but weirdly enough sometimes affecting a few days in December, and in other cases affecting a few days in January.</description>

      <title>Mediator Pattern - CQRS with MediatR</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/064ca62a-b384-45da-9212-4c3840e5ba9c</link>
      <description>The famous mediator pattern. Used so often especially in combination with CQRS.
If you know how to order food at a restaurant then you already halfway there to understand how the CQRS pattern works. I promised it is not that difficult ;)
In this article I will show how the mediator pattern itself works, what CQRS is and its advantages. For that we will write a small application, which demonstrates how to use the pattern and what we gain from using it.
