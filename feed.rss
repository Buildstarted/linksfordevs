      <title>Wearable Microphone Jamming</title>
      <link>http://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/jammer/</link>
      <description>We engineered a wearable microphone jammer that is capable of disabling microphones in its user’s surroundings, including hidden microphones. Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. Moreover, our device exploits a synergy between ultrasonic jamming and the naturally occurring movements that users induce on their wearable devices (e.g., bracelets) as they gesture or walk. We demonstrate that these movements can blur jamming blind spots and increase jamming coverage. Lastly, our wearable bracelet is built in a ring-layout that allows it to jam in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to protect against microphones hidden out of sight.</description>

      <title>Some reasons to work on productivity and velocity</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/productivity-velocity/</link>
      <description>A common topic of discussion among my close friends is where the bottlenecks are in our productivity and how we can execute more quickly. This is very different from what I see in my extended social circles, where people commonly say that velocity doesn&amp;#39;t matter. In online discussions about this, I frequently see people go a step further and assign moral valence to this, saying that it is actually bad to try to increase velocity or be more productive or work hard (see appendix for more examples).</description>

      <title>Common mistakes by indie game developers – Cliffski&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.positech.co.uk/cliffsblog/2021/10/14/common-mistakes-by-indie-game-developers/</link>
      <description>Background: I’ve been a one-man indie studio for over 20 years, sold millions of games on steam, direct, and on mac and even some console stuff. I’ve arguably had 4 ‘hit games’ over that period (seven figure revenue). This is all just my opinion, but its based on long experience. I’ve been programming for 40 years.</description>

      <title>How I Helped ‘hack’ the 2016 Election via Information Warfare – @rej_ex</title>
      <link>https://robertwillishacking.com/the-machine-enabled-by-facebook-how-i-helped-hack-the-2016-election-via-information-warfare/</link>
      <description>Before QAnon, before COVID, fake news as we know it was born during the 2016 election. The following is my story, a whistleblowers account on how I was able to manipulate a reach of tens of millions of targeted Americans weekly during the 2016 election cycle after building/overseeing a fully funded one-of-a-kind syndication machine consisting of a couple hundred targeted websites. Some people will be disappointed that there was no connection to Trump’s campaign. He did benefit greatly from it though.</description>

      <description>The opcache PHP extension implements various functionality to speed up PHP in a transparent manner. As the name indicates, its origin and primary purpose is opcode caching, but nowadays it also contains an optimizer and just-in-time compiler. However, this blog post will focus only on the opcode caching aspect.</description>

      <title>A viable solution for Python concurrency</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/872869/0e62bba2db51ec7a/</link>
      <description>Concerns over the performance of programs written in Python are often
overstated — for some use cases, at least.  But there is no getting around
the problem imposed by the infamous global interpreter lock (GIL), which
severely limits the concurrency of multi-threaded Python code.  Various
efforts to remove the GIL have been made
over the years, but none have come anywhere near the point where they would
be considered for inclusion into the CPython interpreter.  Now, though, Sam
Gross has entered
the arena with a proof-of-concept implementation that may solve the
problem for real.</description>
