      <title>Inside the Kimsuky Leak: How the “Kim” Dump Exposed North Korea’s Credential Theft Playbook - DomainTools Investigations | DTI</title>
      <link>https://dti.domaintools.com/inside-the-kimsuky-leak-how-the-kim-dump-exposed-north-koreas-credential-theft-playbook/</link>
      <description>A rare and revealing breach attributed to a North Korean-affiliated actor, known only as “Kim” as named by the hackers who dumped the data, has delivered a new insight into Kimsuky (APT43) tactics, techniques, and infrastructure. This actor's operational profile showcases credential-focused intrusions targeting South Korean and Taiwanese networks, with a blending of Chinese-language tooling, infrastructure, and possible logistical support. The “Kim” dump, which includes bash histories, phishing domains, OCR workflows, compiled stagers, and rootkit evidence, reflects a hybrid operation situated between DPRK attribution and Chinese resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Be the LetsEncrypt in your homelab with step-ca</title>
      <link>https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/07/letsencrypt-homelab-stepca/</link>
      <description>So you have a Cute Homelab and you want to use it to secure your services and containers with x509 certificates? But your homelab isn’t on the internet, so you can’t simply use LetsEncrypt? Well. You can become your own LetsEncrypt and hand out certificates with certbot. You “just” need to run your own CA (Certificate Authority). Sounds frightening and complicated? It kinda is, but not really when you use step-ca, an open source solution that you can run in a container.</description>

      <title>Why forums died (and what makes them thrive) – 3.st</title>
      <link>https://3.st/2025/09/06/why-forums-died-and-what-makes-them-thrive/</link>
      <description>By now, you likely already have seen someone online lament the loss of forums. Forums used to be the best places online, and then Reddit/Twitter/social media happened, and then it got worse with Discord. That’s the narrative anyway. In reality, nothing ever happens for no reason whatsoever online, and trying to assume such comes off like a bizarre perversion of history in the vein of Idiocracy’s Time Machine:</description>

      <description>More often than not, you won’t feel good before going to the gym. Maybe not even during. You’ll feel good after. Nobody’s forcing you to go, so it’s up to you. The popular saying goes, “The hardest part is putting the shoes on.” Personal growth works the same way. It takes place only after voluntary […]</description>

      <title>Video compression basics – RasterGrid</title>
      <link>https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/multimedia/2021/05/video-compression-basics/</link>
      <description>The Khronos Group recently released a set of provisitional extensions adding video encoding and decoding capabilities to the Vulkan API, collectively referred to as Vulkan Video. This thus seemed like the perfect opportunity to provide an introduction to video compression from the perspective of a graphics programmer, and discuss why having integrated support for video encoding and decoding as part of the Vulkan API is an important step forward for the industry.</description>
