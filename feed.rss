      <title>The party trick called LLM - blowing away smoke and break some mirrors - De Staat van het Web!</title>
      <link>https://destaatvanhetweb.nl/2025/07/12/the-party-trick-called-llm-blowing-away-smoke-and-break-some-mirrors/</link>
      <description>Large Language Models fool you. They don't produce language, but place words in a row. But it's understandable that you think you are dealing with a clever computer. One that occasionally says something that resembles the truth and sounds nice and reliable. You are excused to believe in this magic of ‘AI’ but not after I tell you the trick.</description>

      <title>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1  Incident on July 14, 2025</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1-1-1-1-incident-on-july-14-2025/</link>
      <description>On July 14th, 2025, Cloudflare made a change to our service topologies that caused an outage for 1.1.1.1 on the edge, resulting in downtime for 62 minutes for customers using the 1.1.1.1 public DNS Resolver as well as intermittent degradation of service for Gateway DNS.

We’re deeply sorry for this outage.

This outage was the result of an internal configuration error and not the result of an attack or a BGP hijack. In this blog post, we’re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what we’re doing to make sure this doesn’t happen again.</description>

      <title>Death by a thousand slops</title>
      <link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/</link>
      <description>I have previously blogged about the relatively new trend of AI slop in vulnerability reports submitted to curl and how it hurts and exhausts us. This trend does not seem to slow down. On the contrary, it seems that we have recently not only received more AI slop but also more human slop. The latter … Continue reading Death by a thousand slops →</description>
