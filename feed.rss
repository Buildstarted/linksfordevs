      <title>Electron isn’t Cancer but it is a Symptom of a Disease – Duck Rowing</title>
      <link>https://duckrowing.com/2021/09/04/electron-isnt-cancer-but-it-is-a-symptom-of-a-disease/</link>
      <description>1Password recently announced that they rewrote their longstanding Mac application as an Electron application, and as one might expect, Mac users rightfully lost their shit. A lot of digital ink has been spilled on Electron apps, but to summarize, Electron applications are slow, use a ton of resources, and perhaps worse of all, they don’t look like native applications or follow native conventions. In just about every way, using an Electron application is a degraded experience.</description>

I&amp;#39;ve found that the packages and tools that live under golang.org/x/text are really effective and well designed, although it&amp;#39;s been a bit of a challenge to figure out how to put it all together in a real application.</description>

      <title>No More Medium.&amp;#160;Build Your Own Site, Please.</title>
      <link>https://nomedium.dev/</link>
      <description>There are a number of problems with Medium and its content. Medium is very slow (compare). Medium&amp;#39;s paywall is an insult to good journalism by forcing specific users to pay for content of often questionable quality. The Medium paywall also makes for a suboptimal user experience. When sharing a Medium article, there is a high degree of uncertainty that the person opening the link will be asked to pay money to read the content. The Medium membership model doesn&amp;#39;t work for several folks (likely you too). But, most importantly Medium dilutes your brand and negatively impacts essential metrics. If that&amp;#39;s not enough read more on Why Medium Actually Sucks.</description>

      <title>Working with DevOps friendly EF Core Migration Bundles</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/working-with-ef-core-migration-bundles/</link>
      <description>This post is about EF Core migration bundles, which is a devops friendly way to deploy your database migrations. Currently you can deploy your EF Core migrations either using Code Approach where is you can call the migrations with C# code and another approach is using generating scripts and deploying the scripts using SQL CLI tools - I did some one blog post on how to deploy your EF Core database changes in Azure DevOps - it is using the EF Core script approach. The scripting remains a viable option for migrations. For those who choose the code approach, and to mitigate some of the risks associated with the command line and application startup approaches, the EF Core team introduced the migration bundles in EF Core 6.0 Preview 7.</description>

      <description>You have many things to do in life apart from learning latest technology(ies) in the field. Also, there is problem with learning something when you don&amp;#39;t have clear vision on what and how to learn. It might possible that you learn same topic again and again by reading the different articles, videos, introductory books, and so on. They call it Tutorial Hell. In this case, you just learn basic concepts again and again without deep dive into the topic that you actually need to do.</description>

      <link>https://kerkour.com/blog/rust-cryptography-ecosystem/</link>
      <description>37.2% of vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries are memory safety issues, while only 27.2% are cryptographic issues, according to an empirical Study of Vulnerabilities in Cryptographic Libraries (Jenny Blessing, Michael A. Specter, Daniel J. Weitzner - MIT).
I think it’s time that we move on from C as the de-facto language for implementing cryptographic primitive.
 This post is an excerpt of my book Black Hat Rust
 Due to its high-level nature with low-level controls, absence of garbage collector, portability, and ease of embedding, Rust is our best bet to replace today’s most famous crypto libraries: OpenSSL, BoringSSL and libsodium, which are all written in C.</description>
