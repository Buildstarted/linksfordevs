      <title>Finding the right UUID generation algorithm for FlashMQ.com – BigSmoke</title>
      <link>https://blog.bigsmoke.us/2023/06/04/postgresql-sequential-uuids</link>
      <description>Early during the development of the PostgreSQL backend for FlashMQ.com—that is our amazing managed MQTT hosting service!—, I decided on using UUIDs rather than auto-incrementing integers wherever I needed or wanted surrogate keys. I am one of those people who prefers the use of natural keys where their use is … natural, but I certainly have nothing _against_ surrogate keys, only to their overuse, which usually results from an over-reliance on ORMs (which I do have something against). There are a couple of advantages to using UUIDs over auto-incrementing integers (available in PostgreSQL via sequences):</description>

      <title>On the Duality of Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arthurdevnl.github.io/posts/2023/08/duality-of-intelligence/</link>
      <description>“All models are wrong, but some are useful” goes the saying from George Box. I often find this saying best illustrated by the short story from Jorge Luis Borges. In the story, the ruler is eager to get a map of the empire. Upon his servants returning to him with a map, he states that it does not contain enough detail and wants it to be bigger. Upon increasing the level of detail - and therefore also the size of the map - they return to the ruler, who requests again more detail in the map. This continues for a couple of times until the map contains so much details that it becomes the size of the empire itself. “Have you used it much?” asks the emperor. “It has never been spread out, yet,” says the servant: “the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.”</description>

      <title>Algebraic data types in Lua (Almost)</title>
      <link>https://mrcjkb.dev/posts/2023-08-17-lua-adts.html</link>
      <description>Lua, in the realm of Neovim, is a curious companion.
For personal configuration tweaks, it’s incredibly responsive, giving me immediate feedback.
Moreover, when I’m uncertain about an idea’s potential,
Lua offers a forgiving platform for prototyping without commitment.</description>

      <title>What actually happens when you COPY in Postgres?</title>
      <link>https://blog.benthem.io/2023/08/16/what-actually-happens-when-you-run-copy-in-postgres.html</link>
      <description>I recently had someone ask me why the COPY command is more performant than INSERT INTO. While coming up with an answer, I discovered I was starting from a deficient: I didn’t know how COPY works under the hood. Trying to come up with an answer was at best a guess. Through this post, I hope to narrow that knowledge gap and help myself and others get a deeper understanding of my favorite database.</description>
