      <title>Inline Composables in Vue</title>
      <link>https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/inline-composables-in-vue/</link>
      <description>Inline composables offer a way to refactor components without creating multiple files. The idea is to organize related functionality into units within the same component file.</description>

      <title>OpenAI Strawberry vs Herbie</title>
      <link>https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/o1-herbie.html</link>
      <description>A year and a half ago, I wrote a blog post comparing Herbie to the
first ChatGPT (which we now call, I think, GPT 3.5). I chose 11
floating-point repair benchmarks, and fed all of them to Herbie and
ChatGPT. Herbie is a tool my students and I develop to do exactly this
work, and I wanted to know if AI tools had obsoleted it. The
conclusion was that Herbie was still much better, winning 6/11 and
tying two others. Moreover, the cases where Herbie lost ChatGPT&amp;#39;s
response was usually not actually much better, or was better only
stylistically.</description>

      <title>Is the College Student Startup Pipe Dream Dead?</title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/startup-pipe-dream/</link>
      <description>The college startup pipe dream I write this article to pose a question: Will the next trillion dollar startup be started by a college-aged kid in his dorm?
Can the pattern of Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Google be repeated? (Bezos being a sort-of exception to this, as he was ancient when he started Amazon at 30).
An analysis of historical successes What’s interesting is that all these incumbents started as consumer startups, and most hyperscalable startups that have started in the interim are B2B SaaS.</description>

      <description>I have played a little bit with OpenAI&amp;#39;s new iteration of GPT, GPT-o1, which performs an initial reasoning step before running the LLM.  It is certainly a more capable tool than previous iterations, though still struggling with the most advanced research mathematical tasks.

Here are some concrete experiments (with a prototype version of the model that I was granted access to).  In https://chatgpt.com/share/2ecd7b73-3607-46b3-b855-b29003333b87 I repeated an experiment from https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/109948249160170335 in which I asked GPT to answer a vaguely worded mathematical query which could be solved by identifying a suitable theorem (Cramer&amp;#39;s theorem) from the literature.  Previously, GPT was able to mention some relevant concepts but the details were hallucinated nonsense.  This time around, Cramer&amp;#39;s theorem was identified and a perfectly satisfactory answer was given. (1/3)</description>

      <description>Over the past two years, the United States Government has been
issuing warnings about memory-unsafe programming languages with
increasing urgency. Much of the country’s critical infrastructure relies
on software written in C and C++, languages which are very memory
unsafe, leaving these systems more vulnerable to exploits by
adversaries.</description>

      <title>The Myth of the Lone Wolf Developer: Why Collaboration Skills Matter More Than Coding Skills</title>
      <link>http://hemaks.org/posts/the-myth-of-the-lone-wolf-developer-why-collaboration-skills-matter-more-than-coding-skills/</link>
      <description>Picture this: a dimly lit room, the soft glow of multiple monitors, and a solitary figure hunched over a keyboard, fingers flying as they single-handedly save the world through code. Sounds familiar? If you’re thinking, “Hey, that’s the plot of every hacker movie ever,” you’re not wrong. But here’s the kicker – it’s about as realistic as expecting your computer to make you a sandwich when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delicious.
The Myth of the Coding Hermit
Let’s face it, we’ve all dreamed of being that lone wolf developer at some point. I know I have – there was a time when I thought I could conquer the coding world armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. My code looked like it had been written by a caffeinated squirrel, and my only collaborator was my increasingly concerned houseplant.</description>

      <title>The importance of tech docs</title>
      <link>https://mfbmina.dev/en/posts/tech-docs/</link>
      <description>When I chose to pursue a career in computer science when I was 15 years old, it was basically on liking math and physics. I want to distance myself from writing posts, essays, etc. Time goes by, and now, one of the things that I value at a mature company or team is the existence of technical documentation.
Docs help us to gain historical knowledge of our company, reevaluate decisions, and comprehend the trade-offs between all the decisions.
It is also beneficial for the newcomers because it tells them a story. The richer in detail it is, the better it is.</description>
