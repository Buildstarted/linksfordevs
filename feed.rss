      <title>Key exchange standards - Manning</title>
      <link>https://freecontent.manning.com/key-exchange-standards/#section-89</link>
      <description>From Real-World Cryptography by David Wong  In this article, the author teaches readers about the Diffie-Hellman key exchange standard, which was the very first key exchange algorithm ever invented, and the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange standard, which is the Diffie-Hellman built with elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>The stack monoid</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/gpu/2020/09/05/stack-monoid.html</link>
      <description>This is a bit of a followup to Towards GPGPU JSON parsing. That proposed a rather roundabout way to parallelize a simple parsing task. Having had more GPU programming experience under my belt, I don’t expect that particular approach to work well, but it did suggest that parallelism exists in the problem.</description>

      <description>The Ergodox EZ plays a big part of my day-to-day productivity and managing chronic pain. Since the keyboard has an ortholinear layout, it requires relearning of how to type.</description>

      <title>Building a better home network</title>
      <link>https://kevin.burke.dev/kevin/building-a-better-home-network/?hn=</link>
      <description>I finally got my home network in a place where I am happy with it. I wanted to
share my setup and what I learned about it. There has never been a better time
to set up a great home network; there are several new tools that have made this
easier and better than in the past. Hopefully this will help you set up your
home network!</description>

      <link>https://davidyat.es/2020/09/05/fraidycat/</link>
      <description>Long-time readers will know that I’m a big fan of RSS feeds. An RSS reader has been essential to my web experience since I first came online, and I’ve doggedly stuck to using them even as the web has centralised onto a few platforms and much digital ink spilt about the “death of RSS”. Luckily, I’m not the only one who prefers this old-school, human-curated approach to the web over today’s platforms and their algorithms.</description>

      <title>When to stop working on side-projects</title>
      <link>https://squadrick.dev/journal/when-to-stop-side-projects.html</link>
      <description>I’m a professional coder, and so like all good coders™, I spend a non-trivial number of hours working each week on side-projects. The projects’ range is pretty wide, from low-level RPC stuff to machine learning and rendering engines. Right now, I’m working on several projects that might never see the light-of-day. The most significant among them (and the only one that has been open-sourced) is Shadesmar.</description>
