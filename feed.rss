      <title>How we ran a Unix-like OS (Xv6), on our home-built CPU with our home-built C compiler</title>
      <link>https://fuel.edby.coffee/posts/how-we-ported-xv6-os-to-a-home-built-cpu-with-a-home-built-c-compiler/</link>
      <description>It’s been two years since I started working as a software engineer. I sometimes tell my colleagues about a student project I did in my junior year of university, and it’s so well-received that I’m writing this post. 1
Now, let me ask you a question. Have you ever designed your own ISA, built a processor of that ISA on FPGA, and built a compiler for it? Furthermore, have you run an operating system on that processor?</description>

      <title>It’s 255:19AM. Do you know what your validation criteria are?</title>
      <link>https://hdevalence.ca/blog/2020-10-04-its-25519am</link>
      <description>A basic property of a digital signature scheme is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</description>

      <title>Knolling</title>
      <link>https://andri.yngvason.is/knolling.html</link>
      <description>Software development is a craft. We tend to call it “engineering”, but most of the time, it feels more like plumbing or carpentry. Most of the time, completing a task does not require any inventiveness. Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking that we are more than a craftsmen, engineers even, and in order to verify our bias, we try to be clever where no inventiveness is required. This only complicates things, both in the moment and the future.</description>

      <link>https://lashoun.com/learning/restoring-democracy-a-thought-experiment/</link>
      <description>Democracies: an Endangered Species? In recent years, democratic governments have had their fair share of troubles. The US presidential election of 2016 was probably one of the most shameful and toxic political events to date, with both Democrats and Republicans verbally abusing each other on social media. In France, the 2017 presidential election saw the fall of the major parties (LR and PS) and the rise of the nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen and a newly-born unaffiliated movement created by Emmanuel Macron: La R&amp;#233;publique en Marche, and, in late 2018, the Yellow Vests protests broke out and outlasted even the protest of May 1968.</description>

      <title>The Internet&amp;#39;s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M85UvH0TRPc</link>
      <description>More free documentaries: http://documentarystorm.com

The Internet&amp;#39;s Own Boy follows the story of programming prodigy and information activist Aaron Swartz. From Swartz&amp;#39;s help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz&amp;#39;s groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two-year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron&amp;#39;s story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity.

      <description>At least five bar owners in Grenoble, France have been arrested for providing WiFi at their businesses without keeping logs. The bar owners were arrested under a 2006 law that technically classifies WiFi hotspot providing establishments as ISPs, and requires them to store one year’s worth of logs or connection records for anti-terrorism purposes.

      <description>As well as allowing us to communicate with other people, languages are the tool we use to convey our thoughts, identity, knowledge, and the way we see and understand the world. Mastering more than one language enriches us, provides a gateway to other cultures and, according to a team of researchers led by scientists from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), actively using them also brings us neurological benefits and protects us from cognitive impairment associated with ageing.</description>
