      <title>How Safe is the Cloud? What Businesses Need to Know</title>

      <description>Who remembers the bad old days when businesses had to store all their data on site? It could be pretty risky. What if the office burned down, or the server failed? Plus, connecting to that data from remote locations, while possible, was clumsy and slow. Then, along came the cloud, and voila! Everything became easy. […]</description>

      <description>On February 6th 2023, Kathleen Dollard, principal program manager on .NET team at Microsoft, posted an update of the .NET language strategy.

      <title>Towards Modular Foundations for Protocol Security</title>
      <link>https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/187</link>
      <description>Universally composable (UC) security is the most widely used framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. Many variants and simplifications of the framework have been proposed and developed, nonetheless, many practitioners find UC proofs to be both difficult to construct and understand.

We remedy this situation by proposing a new framework for protocol security. We believe that our framework provides proofs that are both easier to write, but also more rigorous, and easier to understand. Our work is based on state-separable proofs allowing for modular proofs, by decomposing complicated protocols into simple components.</description>

      <description>Many things surprise people about how differently we work at Podia, but one that comes up often is that we have absolutely zero product/project managers at our company of more than 30 people. Despite this — though I’ll argue below that it’s precisely because of this — we’re shipping features faster than companies many times our size and resources.</description>

      <link>https://tuwukee.github.io/ruby/fibers/2023/02/14/granting-at-least-once.html</link>
      <description>Exactly-once is the message delivery guarantee the most developers want to achieve in their systems. In the most cases, the implementation of the set of rules backing it up should include the application layer. When it comes to messaging systems, exactly-once delivery at an app level is much easier to be built on top of at-least-once, since at-most-once sometimes loses messages.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Pharo Smalltalk Plugin</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebastiansastre.co/article/how-to-create-a-pharo-smalltalk-plugin</link>
      <description>When working with Smalltalk, you may wish to access functionality that exists in a specific library or technology that you do not want to recreate. In such cases, you have two options: creating an FFI bridge or extending the Smalltalk VM with new primitives. In this article, we&amp;#39;ll explore the less common method of extending the Pharo Virtual Machine with an external plugin by creating a HelloWorldPlugin. The goal is to provide insight and clarity into the process of extending the VM in this manner, and to explain the steps involved in Pharo 9 as of February 2023.</description>

      <title>How I Decreased ETL Cost by Leveraging the Apache Arrow Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://rcpassos.me/post/apache-arrow-future-of-data-engineering</link>
      <description>In the field of Data Engineering, the Apache Spark framework is one of the most known and powerful ways to extract and process data.
It is well-trusted, and it is also very simple to use once you get the infrastructure set up.
Understandably, most engineers will choose it for every task.
However, in a lot of ways, it can be overkill. And a very expensive one.</description>

      <title>Gamebert: a Game Boy emulator built by Robert | Robert Heaton</title>
      <link>https://robertheaton.com/gamebert/</link>
      <description>I’m a professional computer programmer, but I don’t often do all that much computer programming. Instead I spend much of my time futzing around with config files, other people’s frameworks, and other people. This makes it easy to forget how much fun it is to write a long program that truly interests you and watch it do something a little bit astonishing.</description>

      <title>A brief introduction to Nostr &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/nostr/</link>
      <description>“A milestone for open protocols…” This is how Jack Dorsey, co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, announced the arrival of the Damus app, a Nostr protocol client, in the App Store/iOS.
Nostr has generated buzz in developer groups, bitcoin addicts, and a crowd very suspicious of their own shadows. The reason: Nostr brings an alternative to commercial social media that, in the words of its creators, would be “truly censorship-resistant”.</description>

      <title>.NET Managed languages strategy - .NET</title>
      <link>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/languages</link>
      <description>Each .NET language is unique. C# is the most widely used language and the language most of .NET is written in. F# explores new language possibilities and the community provides a rich experience across platforms. We remain committed to Visual Basic and continue to invest in maintaining C# interop and Visual Studio features for folks that love Visual Basic or want a stable language.</description>
