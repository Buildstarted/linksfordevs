      <title>Configuring my Machines with Bashtard</title>
      <link>https://www.tyil.nl/post/2022/05/07/configuring-my-machines-with-bashtard/</link>
      <description>Over the past couple weeks I’ve been spending some time here and there to work
on my own application for configuring my machines. Before this I’ve tried
Ansible, but found it to be very convoluted to use, and requires a lot of
conditionals if your machines aren’t all running the same base system.</description>

      <title>Deploying on Azure Functions - GitHub Actions</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/deploying-on-azure-functions-github-actions/</link>
      <description>This post is about deploying Azure Function with the help of GitHub Actions. In this post we will discuss how a .NET 6.0 Azure function can be deployed to Azure with the help of GitHub Actions - which will help you to implement continuous delivery / deployment for Azure Functions. First we need to create an Azure Function - I am doing it in the Portal. I am creating a .NET Function.</description>

      <title>EProgrammerNotFound exception in Delphi?</title>
      <link>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2084120/eprogrammernotfound-exception-in-delphi</link>
      <description>In Delphi 2009, SysUtils.pas contains this in line 425:

EProgrammerNotFound = class(Exception);
Is this simply an easter egg or something serious?
When should this exception be raised?
Does it also </description>

      <title>Xilem: an architecture for UI in Rust</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/gui/2022/05/07/ui-architecture.html</link>
      <description>Rust is an appealing language for building user interfaces for a variety of reasons, especially the promise of delivering both performance and safety. However, finding a good architecture is challenging. Architectures that work well in other languages generally don’t adapt well to Rust, mostly because they rely on shared mutable state and that is not idiomatic Rust, to put it mildly. It is sometimes asserted for this reason that Rust is a poor fit for UI. I have long believed that it is possible to find an architecture for UI well suited to implementation in Rust, but my previous attempts (including the current Druid architecture) have all been flawed. I have studied a range of other Rust UI projects and don’t feel that any of those have suitable architecture either.</description>
