      <title>Twelve Virtues of Rationality – Eliezer S. Yudkowsky</title>
      <link>https://www.yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues</link>
      <description>The first virtue is curiosity. A burning itch to know is higher than a solemn vow to pursue truth. To feel the burning itch of curiosity requires both that you be ignorant, and that you desire to relinquish your ignorance. If in your heart you believe you already know, or if in your heart you do not wish to know, then your questioning will be purposeless and your skills without direction. Curiosity seeks to annihilate itself; there is no curiosity that does not want an answer. The glory of glorious mystery is to be solved, after which it ceases to be mystery. Be wary of those who speak of being open-minded and modestly confess their ignorance. There is a time to confess your ignorance and a time to relinquish your ignorance.</description>

      <description>Recently I came across a post, called &amp;quot;Why we stopped making Einsteins&amp;quot;. The main argument is that we are not producing &amp;quot;geniuses&amp;quot; as we used to and it&amp;#39;s the fault of the current education system.

      <title>Why Seafile is unique among file sync solutions</title>
      <link>https://sagar.se/blog/seafiles-unique-feature/</link>
      <description>Seafile
 is a secure, reliable, and performant file sync and share solution. I have been using it since about 2014, occasionally trying out other solutions, but keep returning to Seafile. It has a fairly large feature list and works on every major OS/mobile-device. Self-hosting it has been painless and performance is rock solid. This post describes one particular feature that is useful to me and is present ONLY in Seafile (to the best of my knowledge).
(I am not associated with Seafile in any way. Just a happy user.)</description>
