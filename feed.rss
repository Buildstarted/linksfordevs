      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/cloud-economics/</link>
      <description>Emmanuel Knafo takes a look at cloud economics and cost optimization. In this post, we discuss Cloud Economics. We will focus on&amp;#160;Cost Optimization&amp;#160;which is the first pillar of the&amp;#160;Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework. However, whenever possible, we will extract principles that apply to other Cloud Service Providers (CSP) such as&amp;#160;Amazon Web Services&amp;#160;(AWS) and&amp;#160;Google Cloud Platform&amp;#160;(GCP).</description>

What you definitely don’t want to do is call Terminate&amp;#173;Thread. That way lies madness. What you can do is enable call cancellation by calling Co&amp;#173;Enable&amp;#173;Call&amp;#173;Cancellation,</description>

Responsive design has always been the cornerstone of web development, rather than designing for a single use case, we focus on creating applications that can adjust to the needs of the platform they are running on.

      <title>.NET GC Internals mini-series – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/net-gc-internals-mini-series/</link>
      <description>I’ve decided to make a series of at least 8 free weekly-based webinars about in-depth implementation details of the .NET GC and… I’m super happy with it! Why the idea? Many my other activities are about more practical “.NET memory management”, like my book or workshops/trainings/consultancy I gave. But during all this practical-oriented events there is always not enough time to explain in details how .NET GC is implemented. Obviously, I always explain some concepts and algorithms, to the level that helps in understanding the whole concept. But not with the level of details that I am satisfied.</description>

      <title>HTML and CSS still isn’t about painting with code</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2021/01/21/teaching-html-and-css/</link>
      <description>The other day I had a friend come to my place with the request to “learn HTML and how web sites work”. We spent a few hours playing with the topic and she got excited and quite far into it. The whole thing reminded me about a real problem when it comes to teaching people HTML. We keep fast-tracking the learning to the fun part of building visual things with it.</description>

      <description>Long term readers of this blog will know our devotion to using container-based technology, especially Docker, to significantly improve software quality through repeatable builds. In the Autumn/fall of 2020, Microsoft introduced a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension Remote – Containers.
