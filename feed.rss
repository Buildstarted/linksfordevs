      <title>You Can’t “Know” A Programming Language</title>
      <link>https://rodneylafuente.com/jekyll/update/2023/03/29/you-can%27t-know-a-programming-language.html</link>
      <description>I see a lot of job postings that, if they aren’t putting a programming language directly in the title of a position they are hiring for, will put the name of the language as an important requirement somewhere in the job description. I believe this sort of practice is guided by a misconstrued perception of what the relationship is between people and their ability to develop software. There should be no “Java Developer” or “React Developer;” there should be only “Software Developer,” regardless of the languages a person will be interacting with in a job. People don’t know programming languages to the extent they should be labeled with them. It may even make more sense to say that people can’t “know” programming languages to begin with.</description>

      <title>Indie app developers, the App Store “middle class” &amp;#183; Notes</title>
      <link>https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2023/indie-app-developers/</link>
      <description>In 2022, we downloaded just over 140 billion apps onto our phones. In financial terms, we spent USD 129 billion tapping virtual buttons on the screen of devices that fit in our pockets.
Not even the most optimistic Apple executive could have predicted in 2008, at the launch of the iOS App Store, that this mobile app business could be so profitable. And so useful. From the trivial activities of the early days, like reading e-mail and opening websites, we have gone on to do almost everything on the phone, from paying for things and investing to “summoning” cars and food.</description>

      <link>https://aminrb.me/blog/onboarding-storytelling/</link>
      <description>When you join a new team, you are usually bombarded with a lot of information. You need to familiarize yourself with the company’s culture, facilities, and colleagues. Initially, the onboarding process tends to be welcoming and hospitable. However, after a few days, you are expected to quickly learn about the products, services, and data in order to contribute effectively. It can be overwhelming to try to absorb and utilize all of this information, and eventually, the honeymoon phase ends, leaving you feeling stressed and concerned about your credibility.</description>
