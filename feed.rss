      <title>Laurence Tratt: Static Integer Types</title>
      <link>https://tratt.net/laurie/essays/entries/static_integer_types.html</link>
      <description>Over several years I’ve had several conversations with people about static integer
types in programming languages. Given the number of subtleties in the design, and pitfalls in the
use, of integer types it’s not surprising that most programmers are
unaware of at least some of them. However, what is perhaps more surprising is that most
programming language designers and implementers aren’t fully aware of
some of the subtleties and pitfalls either. That leads to languages and their
implementations baking in unintended, and sometimes unfortunate, design decisions.
At the end of conversations on this topic, I’ve sometimes said “this stuff
is hard and someone should think more about this and write it up” but it’s an
unsatisfying conclusion. So even though I don’t have all the answers – indeed, I’m
fairly sure that I don’t know all the questions – I’m going to jot down my
current thinking on this subject.</description>

      <description>Let’s say we have a RESTful API for a general ledger, with the endpoints, that return a paginated collection of resources:

GET /accounts, retrieves a list of accounts, filtered and sorted by some query parameters;
GET /accounts/:uuid/transactions, retrieves a list of transactions for account;
GET /postings, retrieves a list of postings stored in the ledger.

My experience is that the better that I can see and
hear someone in an online call, the more natural the conversation feels. Put
another way, I think one does a courtesy to the other person by improving the
quality of how you appear in a video call.</description>

      <title>The impact of digital media on children’s intelligence while controlling for genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic background - Scientific Reports</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-11341-2</link>
      <description>Digital media defines modern childhood, but its cognitive effects are unclear and hotly debated. We believe that studies with genetic data could clarify causal claims and correct for the typically unaccounted role of genetic predispositions. Here, we estimated the impact of different types of screen time (watching, socializing, or gaming) on children’s intelligence while controlling for the confounding effects of genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic status. We analyzed 9855 children from the USA who were part of the ABCD dataset with measures of intelligence at baseline (ages 9–10) and after two years. At baseline, time watching (r = −&amp;amp;nbsp;0.12) and socializing (r = −&amp;amp;nbsp;0.10) were negatively correlated with intelligence, while gaming did not correlate. After two years, gaming positively impacted intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.17), but socializing had no effect. This is consistent with cognitive benefits documented in experimental studies on video gaming. Unexpectedly, watching videos also benefited intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.12), contrary to prior research on the effect of watching TV. Although, in a posthoc analysis, this was not significant if parental education (instead of SES) was controlled for. Broadly, our results are in line with research on the malleability of cognitive abilities from environmental factors, such as cognitive training and the Flynn effect.</description>

      <description>After a long wait, the Progress Report is back! This time it wasn&amp;#39;t so much from a lack of content, but from a lack of content creators. The past three months had illnesses hit one of our writers and the other had a very challenging move. Even with these major hurdles jumped, we&amp;#39;re not even close to 100% yet. It&amp;#39;s been a battle to get caught up with all of the big changes to Dolphin the past couple of months and because of that this report is a tad late.
Needless to say, there&amp;#39;s only one way to start catching up, and that&amp;#39;s to get to digging through the past three months of Notable Changes. Enjoy!</description>
