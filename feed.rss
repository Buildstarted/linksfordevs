      <description>Ok, I have to admit that the provided instructions aren’t bad at all. They actually state (most) of the required steps to do this, with a couple key missing pieces that caused me some trouble and resulted in quite a few trial-and-error attempts. I’m writing this down for my own future reference and hopefully it will save you some time too. Why First, why is any of this needed at all? Well, basically, at the time of this writing, neither .NET 5 nor .NET 6 are officially supported in Azure Functions. This means there isn’t a simple dropdown to just...</description>

      <title>Follow boring advice</title>
      <link>http://nywkap.com/other/follow-boring-advice.html</link>
      <description>Most of the advice leading to great results in life is boring. Also, it’s free and has forever been so. In my twenties, I believed that successful people hold secret knowledge leading to their success. I obsessed over “self-help porn”: books, videos, and blogs promising to reveal little secrets that would make me successful one day, too. But when I started observing and talking to people I consider successful, I noticed they don’t do anything extraordinary. In fact, they do quite the opposite. They follow “boring” advice I already heard a million times in proverbs, religious and old philosophy stories, and even from my grandma. And it makes sense!. It has already been figured out for thousands of years! There is nothing new a Brian can write in his next New York Times bestseller while sipping a $9 latte that I didn’t hear before. All I ever had to do is to act on that well-known advice. You know it in one form or another, too! Here are a couple of examples:</description>

      <title>New UT/Texas Politics Project Poll finds Texans dour and deeply divided</title>
      <link>https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/blog/new-uttexas-politics-project-poll-finds-texans-dour-and-deeply-divided</link>
      <description>The latest University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll finds Texans in a dour mood colored by a resurgent COVID-19 virus, an economy recovering yet roiled by its impact, and state politics driven by increasingly entrenched and in many instances extreme partisanship, which is being accentuated by the Republican monopoly on state government. Texans expressed more worry about the surging pandemic and its effects than in June, and gave Governor Abbott the lowest job approval rating of his tenure in office. A majority – 52% –&amp;#160; said the state is headed in the wrong direction, the worst assessment of the direction of the state since the inception of this polling project in 2008.</description>

      <description>A month ago I ran into an obscure Google Chrome bug on macOS that caused the &amp;quot;All cookies and site data&amp;quot; page in Chrome settings (chrome://settings/siteData) to load very slowly. You can see this page if you open Preferences, select &amp;quot;Privacy and security&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Cookies and other site data&amp;quot;, and then &amp;quot;See all cookies and site data&amp;quot;. I filed a bug report with Chromium&amp;#39;s issue tracker. Since then, some members of the Chromium team have been trying to track down the cause of the bug, a normal and boring process. However, this week I got an update on the issue that was shocking to me:</description>
