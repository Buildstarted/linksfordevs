      <title>The C Standard Library Is Not Dependency Free</title>
      <link>https://prilik.com/blog/post/c-is-not-dependency-free/</link>
      <description>Like any great systems programming language, it doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t take much of anything to get C up and running on a new platform.
In fact, a minimal C &amp;amp;ldquo;runtime&amp;amp;rdquo; (typically called crt0) only consists of a short prelude that zeroes out the .bss section and hands off execution to main.
That&amp;amp;rsquo;s it!
Compared to other popular programming languages, which require substantial runtime machinery to operate (e.g: Java&amp;amp;rsquo;s virtual machine, Go&amp;amp;rsquo;s garbage collector, etc&amp;amp;hellip;), C&amp;amp;rsquo;s extremely minimal approach to language design has allowed it to run on just about any platform.
Unfortunately, while C is effectively dependency free at the language level, the same can&amp;amp;rsquo;t be said about its standard library.

      <title>youtube-dl repository restored at GitHub</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/837343/rss</link>
      <description>The GitHub repository
for the youtube-dl 
utility, which is used to download video content from various web sites
(including YouTube, thus the name), has been restored.  As we reported in last week&amp;#39;s
edition, GitHub had taken the repository down due to a DMCA
notice from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  The
only change
made to youtube-dl 
is the removal of some tests that downloaded a few seconds of certain music videos; those
videos were specifically targeted by the RIAA in its complaint.</description>
