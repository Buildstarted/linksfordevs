      <title>Learn to write COBOL programs in VS Code</title>
      <link>https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-write-cobol-programs-in-vs-code/</link>
      <description>The COBOL programing language first appeared over 60 years ago. Today it still
powers much of the world economy.

COBOL is often used to process the most critical data. It is one of the main
languages that powers large mainframe computers. Because of its age and the
mission-critical nature of its applications, it is efficient, reliable, and
secure.

You may have heard about COBOL in the news lately, since it powers the core
business logic of many large enterprises. And yet, many experienced COBO</description>

      <description>Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate Tony Hoare's 
famous maxim "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." Ken 
Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as "When in doubt, use 
brute force.". Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the design 
philosophy KISS. Rule 5 was previously stated by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. Rule 5 is often shortened to "write stupid code that uses smart objects".</description>

      <title>The Social Media Problem · Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/the-social-media-problem/</link>
      <description>After seeing some of the weirdest stuff ever show up in my Twitter timeline I decided to dig in and see for myself what is going on in the underbelly of the beast. Someone I follow had just re-tweeted a bit of information that at face value seemed too outrageous to even consider and wondered what made that happen. In short, the original tweet mentioned that COVID-19 is a hoax, that the virus isn’t real and that this whole pandemonium is just an excuse by ‘them’ to get us all under control if not to outright murder us using a vaccine.</description>

      <description>A state court has dismissed a high-profile case showing unsportsmanlike conduct by Google, which was caught red-handed using lyrics obviously scraped from Genius.

      <title>Tip 274 - Set Your AzContext Interactively</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip274.html</link>
      <description>If you are working with Azure, the probability of you having multiple accounts and subscriptions to work with are very high. If I look at myself, I have a personal account, a business account and my workaccount that I often use everyday. Deploying scripts through Powershell requires you to make sure you are in the right context. Especially with the rise of Azure Lighthouse, where you maybe have access to a lot of subscriptions through one account, a simple mistake is easily made.</description>

      <title>Check out this workshop @AzureAIConf - Advanced .NET, Containers and Azure</title>
      <link>https://virtual.devintersection.com/#!/workshop/Advanced%20.NET,%20Containers%20and%20Azure/4591</link>
      <description>This workshop will walk .NET customers through all the options for hosting their code in Azure using Windows, Linux and Containers. You will learn how to develop locally on Windows and Linux and containers and then publish and diagnose your applications in Azure. Next we will take a deep dive into building API’s and gPRC services in .NET that can be called from all platforms. Including developing API’s that can be tested on the local development box with the application running in Azure. And finally we will dive into some of the new capabilities in .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 to make your web services into single file executables that are both small and easy to host. Each section will cover a topic and then have exercises you can go through on your own computer.  When your done you should understand how to build API’s and services, host them in the variety of options that Azure provides and build small and performant API’s.</description>
