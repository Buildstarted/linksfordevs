      <title>LLM Inference Economics from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://www.tensoreconomics.com/p/llm-inference-economics-from-first</link>
      <description>The main product LLM companies offer these days is access to their models via an API, and the key question that will determine the profitability they can enjoy is the inference cost structure.</description>

      <title>Rich: Enrich your CSVs with new columns</title>
      <link>https://blog.marcua.net/2025/05/22/rich-enrich-your-csvs-with-new-columns.html</link>
      <description>This week a fellow B12er was performing an ad-hoc data analysis. They had a spreadsheet with some data, and wanted to classify the rows in the spreadsheet by a few different criteria along which they would look for trends. For an engineer, this would have been a quick Python script wrapping some classifier (in our case, the OpenAI API), but there wasn‚Äôt an engineer available for the project. We looked at some third-party plugins for Google Sheets, but it wasn‚Äôt clear what sorts of guarantees they made around data privacy, and we didn‚Äôt feel comfortable installing them. So, with some help from OpenAI‚Äôs o3, I created Rich, an OpenAI-powered CSV data enricher that‚Äôs a fully client-side single-page application.</description>

      <title>A SomewhatMaxSAT Solver</title>
      <link>https://blog.jak-linux.org/2025/05/24/somewhatmax-sat-solver/</link>
      <description>As you may recall from previous posts and elsewhere I have been busy writing a new solver for APT. Today I want to share some of the latest changes in how to approach solving.
The idea for the solver was that manually installed packages are always protected from removals ‚Äì in terms of SAT solving, they are facts. Automatically installed packages become optional unit clauses. Optional clauses are solved after manual ones, they don‚Äôt partake in normal unit propagation.</description>

      <description>In small to mid-sized engineering teams, unchecked diversity in backend technology stacks can lead to increased cognitive load, fragmented knowledge, and reduced team mobility. While each language or tool may offer individual advantages, the lack of alignment often results in duplicated efforts, inconsistent practices, and slower progress</description>
