      <title>Securing and exposing local services with Tailscale and Nginx</title>
      <link>https://blog.viktorpetersson.com/2022/12/23/securing-services-with-tailscale.html</link>
      <description>Securing and encrypting communication on local network devices is a hard problem. Plenty of people tried, including myself in our now sunsetted company WoTT. The root of the problem is a combination of DNS and routing to local IPs, which means you can’t use automated certificate issuers, like Let’s Encrypt. The solution, it seems, comes from an unexpected source: the VPN/Wireuard service provider Tailscale.</description>

      <title>How does a Display work?</title>
      <link>https://gaunergang.de/blog/how-does-a-display-work.html</link>
      <description>As someone who has spent countless hours staring at a screen (admit it, we
    all have), you may have wondered at some point how exactly a monitor works.
    Well, wonder no more! In this blog post, we&amp;#39;ll take a brief look at the
    inner workings of a monitor, and hopefully come out on the other side with a
    newfound appreciation for the technology that brings us our favorite movies,
    TV shows, and cat videos.</description>

      <link>https://andysylvester.com/2022/12/22/rsscloud-wordpress-feedland-and-dave-winer/</link>
      <description>This is an attempt to capture some work/events I have been involved with over the last few weeks regarding the rssCloud protocol. I hope this will provide some insights into software development and technical communication, and will be of use to others using the rssCloud protocol. I hope it will also demonstrate that it can be difficult to identify/isolate problems between multiple apps/web services/web sites, and that all involved in the discussion should adopt a mindset of “follow the data” and be open to input from others.</description>

      <title>RSS Readers That You Can Self Host</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/rss-readers-that-you-can-self-host/</link>
      <description>Self-hosted RSS readers offer users a way to customize their feeds and have more control over their data and privacy. One of the main advantages of using a self-hosted RSS reader is that it allows you to avoid the algorithms that drive many commercial platforms. These algorithms are designed to show you content that they think you’ll be interested in based on your past browsing history and other factors. With a self-hosted RSS reader, you have complete control over what you see in your feed and can customize it to your liking.</description>

      <description>While I have been happy with my previous desktop setup using Wayland on Alpine Linux, I just couldn’t shake the urge to fully embrace the suckless ecosystem. Although, this meant ditching Wayland and returning to X11, which is apparently the new “cool thing to hate” in Linux land. At least, that’s what I’ve seen online lately.</description>
