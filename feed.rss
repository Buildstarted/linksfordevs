      <description>One of my biggest motivators to make money in my early 20s was traveling. I would book one way tickets to places near and far, enjoy the nature, the food, the culture, and the lovely people. I would come back a slightly wiser, friendlier and a happier person.</description>

      <title>Bumps In the Gumroad</title>
      <link>https://oddevan.com/2025/04/04/bumps-in-the-gumroad.html</link>
      <description>It‚Äôs hard to overstate just how much my opinion on Gumroad has changed since the beginning of 2025. I‚Äôm not mad, just disappointed. Incredibly disappointed.
Strike One: Unintended Consequences Let me preface this by saying I get problems with email delivery. There‚Äôs a whole system of checks and ranking that is based almost entirely on reputation. And it goes layers deep: bad behavior by one entity can risk the reputation of a provider serving thousands of people.</description>

      <title>Things I learned rewriting a project from scratch</title>
      <link>https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-04-05-learned-rewrite/</link>
      <description>Around two years ago I wrote about a
project I have been working on and off for a few years. In that post
I explain how and why I decided to rewrite it from scracth, splitting
it in multiple parts. I ended up not following exactly the plan that I
laid out, and I also worked on the rewrite more slowly than I wanted.
But rewriting from scratch allowed me to experiment with new ideas and
discover new tricks, and after two years I learned enough stuff that I
can make a blog post about it!</description>

      <title>Trip To China</title>
      <link>https://jalexine.github.io/trip-to-china.html</link>
      <description>Everyday life Life here feels way easier. Paying, ordering, getting around‚Äîeverything‚Äôs smooth and efficient. Technology is more advanced and more integrated. The quality of service is on another level. Workers are more involved and friendly, which makes daily life way more pleasant. You can find any type of services, like someone waiting for you at a restaurant, sending an item for you.. You can received products in 20 min. Cities are a bit less walkable, some big ones are massive, and it can feel overwhelming at times. The food is so fxcking great, super diverse, and cheap. Tourism is also built mainly for Chinese people, which makes it fascinating to experience from the outside. They build so much infrastructure for Chinese tourism‚Äîsometimes it can be weird because you find empty villages, shopping malls, hotels‚Ä¶ People don‚Äôt really talk politics unless they‚Äôre very close. What stands out most is how safe it feels. You can leave your bag in public and it‚Äôll still be there, maybe not in nightclubs tho. As a girl, being able to walk at night without fear is priceless. The worst thing you can experience at a party is being too drunk. There are no drugs. I haven‚Äôt seen homeless people either. Streets are clean.</description>

      <title>How to Replace LeetCode with Something That Actually Works</title>
      <link>https://ebellani.github.io/blog/2025/how-to-replace-leetcode-with-something-that-actually-works/</link>
      <description>Recently there has been an interest in cheating(?) leetcode style interviews(Yang 2025). These articles highlight a longstanding issue in tech recruiting: puzzle-style assessments have little to no correlation with actual job performance(Konnikova 2013; McAllister 2013), and leetcode is nothing but algorithmic puzzles. This makes them a poor predictor of job performance. What leetcode does predict seems to be success at leetcode style interviews(Mroczka 2024). Go figure.
If you are in power to stop doing these silly things and reach for something with actual evidence of working, here is a blueprint for performing a structured interview with a focus on programmers, but that can be adapted for other positions quite easily.</description>
