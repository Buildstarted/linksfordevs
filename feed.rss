      <title>February 18, 2020 - Giving Blazor a ViewState?</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X4MN8cue1A</link>
      <description>Web Forms has ViewState and Blazor manages state in memory... is there a way to re-make Web Forms ViewState for Blazor to help make migration easier?  That's our task in this episode

27:47 - You're telling people not to use the ViewState for new stuff, so step 1: use it and get the move in. Step 2: start refactoring to use better practices. Without step 1 you can't do step 2
29:17 -  I can't sell a change if I have to rewrite a ton of stuff just to move to Blazor.
30:10 - Remember that rewrites are dangerous, refactors are much safer.
40:58 - Ok, but do we like WaitForAssertion instead of VerifyAsyncChange?
1:12:58 - Does it work with VB's inline XML support?
1:38:55 - Has anyone hosted WPF UI elements in Winforms?
1:39:48 - When will MS make stuff open source?

      <title>February 19, 2020 - Blazor Component Updates to Support DataBinding</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBDIwGEWmUs</link>
      <description>In this video, Fritz walks through ensuring that the new DataBinder that we built in a previous video works on the FormView component.

27:32 - Is there an official explanation of the name Blazor?
28:57 - What is the difference between a logo and an icon?
1:08:33 - What is .NET?
1:09:42 - Is there a way to develop an app that can generate static pages so I can put the generated pages on multipage sites?
1:27:24 - Does anyone know if it's possible to have a Component only render it's 'Content' (Child Content) if a certain condition is true inside the component itself?
1:29:22 - How popular is F# and is it worth learning?
1:48:04 - Do you suggest I learn Blazor, MVC, Web Forms, or something else?

      <title>February 16, 2020 - Open Source C#, Blazor, and the DataBinder</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7GRTh7-6P4</link>
      <description>In this episode, Jeff talks about mimicking the ASP.NET Web Forms DataBinder object so that it's syntax can be re-used in Blazor

11:13 - Do you know if there were any plans to support XAML in Blazor so it would be like programming WPF for web?
16:09 - Anyone know of any dotnet core open-source projects easy to pop in and contribute to?
39:46 - Are you going to add AutoPostBack?
46:39 - Does making DataBinder a Component make it much heavier to execute/needs too much resources?
47:04 - This is using Reflection, right?
1:43:33 - When working with Git branches, should you a) merge 'origin' dev or b) pull 'origin' dev to get changes from dev into the working feature branch and what's the difference?
1:45:40 - Isn't a pull a fetch and merge in one git command?

      <title>Max Hodak - What is relativity, anyway?</title>
      <link>https://maxhodak.com/nonfiction/2020/09/18/relativity.html</link>
      <description>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure logic puzzle science, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is – the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? – but they don’t really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</description>

      <title>Brittney Braxton - Journaling as a Dev [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzrEDnIye14</link>
      <description>Note: There are initial captions directly in the video until the interpreter begins.

Are you working with impact and purpose? Are you solidly attuned on what you're doing month-to-month with your role? How difficult is it for you to track your accomplishments at work? If any of these questions lead to uncertain answers, then you should learn what it means to journal professionally as a dev. This talk will cover my exploration into journaling and its application to tracking my goals and progress as a software engineer. I will discuss how to set up your journal for any goals and how to score on your performance review!
