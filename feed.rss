      <title>Downtown Doug Brown &amp;#187; Apple’s long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found</title>
      <link>https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2025/03/apples-long-lost-hidden-recovery-partition-from-1994-has-been-found/</link>
      <description>In my last post about hard drives that go bad over time, I hinted at having rescued a lost piece of obscure Apple software history from an old 160 MB Conner hard drive that had its head stuck in the parked position. This post is going to be all about it. It’s the tale of a tad bit of an obsession, what felt like a hopeless search, and how persistence eventually paid off. There’s still an unsolved mystery too, so I’m hoping others will see this and help to fill in the blanks!</description>

      <title>Career advice in 2025.</title>
      <link>https://lethain.com/career-advice-2025/</link>
      <description>Yesterday, the tj-actions repository, a popular tool used with Github Actions was compromised (for more background read one of these two articles). Watching the infrastructure and security engineering teams at Carta respond, it highlighted to me just how much LLMs can’t meaningfully replace many essential roles of software professionals. However, I’m also reading Jennifer Palkha’s Recoding America, which makes an important point: decision-makers can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. (Or, in this context, remain employed.)</description>

      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-from-dissertation-to-dominating-the-web/</link>
      <description>The internet runs on a lot of things—electricity, servers, cat videos—but when it comes to how web applications communicate, REST has been leading the way for over two decades. But where did REST come from? And how did it go from an academic concept to powering the world’s most significant web services? Let’s dive into the origin and evolution of REST.</description>

      <title>The YX Problem (Reverse XY Problem)</title>
      <link>https://yawn.io/posts/yx-problem-v2/</link>
      <description>XY Problem interactions go something like this:
Tess: How do I disable SELinux?
Burt: Don’t disable SELinux. Go and read https://xyproblem.info then ask your ACTUAL question.
Tess: My webserver is crashing with “can’t read /etc/foo.conf: permission denied”
Burt: You need to do chmod a+r /etc/foo.conf.
And yeah, fine, in this case Burt had a point. But what about this one:

Burt: Don’t disable SELinux. Go and read https://xyproblem.</description>

      <title>I think we need a bigger boot partition... ｜ fernvenue&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/i-think-we-need-a-bigger-boot-partition/</link>
      <description>Long ago, during the time of creation, I confidently waved my hand and allocated a 1GB ESP partition and a 1GB boot partition, thinking to myself with a confident smile that this would surely be more than enough for the foreseeable future. However, this foreseeable future quickly vanished along with my smile. What was bound to happen eventually came, but I didn’t expect it to arrive so soon. What could possibly require such a large boot partition? And how should we resolve this? Here, I would like to introduce the boot partition issue I encountered, as well as temporary coping methods and final solutions, mentioning the problems encountered along the way for reference.</description>

      <title>Using PBR to Route Traffic on OpenWrt ｜ fernvenue&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/using-pbr-to-route-traffic-on-openwrt/</link>
      <description>Playing around with OpenWrt often involves multiple outbounds, maybe multiple ISPs or VPN outbounds like WireGuard. We always need to configure and route the traffic. Configuring routing can actually be a headache because as the needs become more complex, the difficulty of configuration tends to increase exponentially, also considering potential conflicts. Using ipset is certainly good, but the workload doesn’t diminish, it becomes greater sometimes. To address this need, I chose PBR, aka Policy-Based Routing, simplifying this complex problem with some simple configuration scripts.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Postgres Isolation Anomalies and How To Tame Them</title>
      <link>https://dansvetlov.me/postgres-anomalies/</link>
      <description>Postgres is a powerful and versatile database management system, now ubiquitously used in all types of applications. In the context of web services, its most important property is the ability to serve multitudes of users at the same time. This article explores how Postgres makes it possible by examining what can go wrong when transactions from multiple users interweave - it covers isolation levels and possible anomalies, along with ways to avoid them</description>

      <description>The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller to use for do-it-yourself home automation, sensors, and a variety of other bits and bobs that you might want to take care of around the house. It’s the successor to the venerable ESP8266 which has found its way into many of our WiFi connected devices (seriously, open up a device and changes are relatively large that you’ll find one).</description>

      <description>I was recently reading Biohacking Lite by Andrej Karpathy, particularly the section called The Four Batteries of Your Body. For the first time in my life, health-related topics are starting to make sense to me because Karpathy explains them from first principles.
TLDR This is my TLDR after an hour of studying the topic. Any mistakes or misunderstandings are my own, and I may update this as my knowledge improves.
