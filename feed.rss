      <description>I am no NixOS expert by any means, I only recently switched to it as my daily driver. I have rebuilt my workstation and home server on top of it, and am in the process of rebuilding my public facing server with it, too. Nevertheless, when I read Xe Iaso&amp;#39;s latest blog post, and the ensuing discussion on lobste.rs, I had Thoughts.</description>

      <title>Deshittifying the Internet of Things starts with me. – Supermechanical</title>
      <link>https://blog.supermechanical.com/2023/10/15/deshittifying-the-internet-of-things-starts-with-me/</link>
      <description>What was once a promise of technology to allow us to automate and analyze the environments in our physical spaces is now a heap of broken ideas and broken products. Technology products have been deployed en masse, our personal data collected and sold without our consent, and then abandoned as soon as companies strip mined all the profit they thought they could wring out. And why not? They already have our money.</description>

      <link>https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1660597148686808572-live-tech-games-azure-gaming-fifa-world-cup-uk</link>
      <description>Live Tech Games is on a mission to create unique, massively multiplayer mobile gaming experiences that people genuinely want to be a part of. To achieve this, Live Tech Games runs live social tournament games. At set times (for example, 7 PM each evening), a push notification announces the game is starting, and users play live against each other at that moment. Live Tech Games also runs games that are televised live in event halls and pubs after live shows and sporting events to help draw in large audiences from across the United Kingdom. In September 2022, Live Tech Games began working on Knockout, a new football trivia game in which players go head-to-head in three rounds televised at the end of each match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.</description>
