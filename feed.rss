      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2023/01/26/rusts-ugly-syntax.html#Rust-s-Ugly-Syntax</link>
      <description>People complain about Rust syntax.
I think that most of the time when people think they have an issue with Rust&amp;#39;s syntax, they actually object to Rust&amp;#39;s semantics.
In this slightly whimsical post, I&amp;#39;ll try to disentangle the two.</description>

      <title>Basic Windows Machine Hardware information from WMI for Exception Logging from .NET</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Feb/02/Basic-Windows-Machine-Hardware-information-from-WMI-for-Exception-Logging-from-NET</link>
      <description>When writing out error information for a desktop application to a log whether local or to a telmetry engine, it&amp;#39;s useful to get some idea of what hardware the app is running on. WPF applications in particular can have odd behaviors that are related to hardware acceleration, running inside of a VM or particular video drivers. In this short post I show how you can get very basic machine and GPU information that provides information on these basic system stats that can prove useful to trackdown rare hardware related issues.</description>

      <description>As an interviewer, a mentor, and now a hiring manager I have put a lot of time and thought into the technical coding interview: the practice of asking candidates to solve a programming question on a whiteboard (or in CoderPad.) Rather than writing yet another “cracking the coding interview” guide, of which there are already a million, this post tries to focus on the broader picture. I’ve broken it down into several sections.</description>
