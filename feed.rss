      <title>Video compression basics ‚Äì RasterGrid</title>
      <link>https://www.rastergrid.com/blog/multimedia/2021/05/video-compression-basics/</link>
      <description>The Khronos Group recently released a set of provisitional extensions adding video encoding and decoding capabilities to the Vulkan API, collectively referred to as Vulkan Video. This thus seemed like the perfect opportunity to provide an introduction to video compression from the perspective of a graphics programmer, and discuss why having integrated support for video encoding and decoding as part of the Vulkan API is an important step forward for the industry.</description>

      <title>Nest 1st gen and 2nd gen thermostats no longer supported by Google from 10/25/2025 - üõéÔ∏è Get Help / Integrations - Hubitat</title>

      <description>I just received an email from Google stating that they are no longer it's going to support the Nest 1st gen and 2nd gen thermostats. While they will continue to operate locally, it appears that they will no longer work with the Nest app or Home app controls. I currently use the Nest app to control the thermostats, but does this mean that we won't even be able to control the thermostats via a Hubitat integration?  Cheers,  Simon</description>

      <title>Drive manually</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/09/driving-by-hand</link>
      <description>On the 30th of August, 2000, a train flew out of the tunnel at a station in Paris, and, without stopping, rolled on through into the tunnel. It was clear that the train was speeding, and speeding severely. Inside the tunnel, the train has derailed with the front cab car turning over. Luckily, there were no fatalities. 24 people were injured. The investigation was able to establish that the train‚Äôs speed was above the maximum permitted on that section of track by 20 km/h, if not more. How could this happen, given that the Paris Metro has been equipped with automatic speed control since the early 70s?</description>

      <description>Some programming languages let you define functions that are easy to

            keyword arguments, tuples, records, or some nesting of those. But I
            don't know any language that makes it very nice to define such

      <title>What to do with an old iPad</title>
      <link>http://odb.ar/blog/2025/09/05/hosting-my-blog-on-an-iPad-2.html</link>
      <description>I recently inherited my parents‚Äô old iPad 2. It had iOS 9 on it and was barely usable, in part due to how slow it was but mostly because of old SSL certificates and apps stopping support. But I wanted to give it some life because I hate to see a working machine go to waste. So I asked around and got a great answer: The iPad 2 can be downgraded to iOS 6.1.3 or 8.4.1. Both offer better performance than iOS 9 and have untethered jailbreaks. Once downgraded and jailbroken you can sideload hours and hours worth of games. A lot from that era are IAP-free.</description>

      <title>How and why I built an MCP server for Svelte - Stanislav Khromov</title>
      <link>https://khromov.se/how-and-why-i-built-an-mcp-server-for-svelte/</link>
      <description>If you‚Äôre using Svelte with coding assistants, you know that these assistants aren‚Äôt always aware of the latest features in Svelte 5 and SvelteKit. They‚Äôll suggest outdated patterns, mix up the old reactive syntax with the new runes system, or simply hallucinate syntax that doesn‚Äôt exist. These problems have made LLM assistants less useful in Svelte and SvelteKit projects ‚Äì so I decided to set out and build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives AI assistants direct access to the latest Svelte documentation. Demo: What can it actually do? Here‚Äôs a short video I recorded demonstrating some of [‚Ä¶]</description>
