      <title>Coding As Creative Expression</title>
      <link>https://fabisevi.ch/2022/05/21/coding-as-creative-expression/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve seen many versions of this question posed over the years, and to Matthew&amp;#39;s credit it&amp;#39;s a very good question. As you can see in the replies people translate their lived experience writing code and answer art or science based on however they conceptualize and practice programming. A few years ago MIT conducted a study that concluded &amp;quot;reading computer code is not the same as reading language&amp;quot;, answering the question of whether coding is art or science with a rigorously documented &amp;quot;both&amp;quot;. While I&amp;#39;m hard-pressed to argue with science, I&amp;#39;d like to provide a different answer, one that&amp;#39;s a little more conceptual.</description>

      <title>The /bin/true Command and Copyright</title>
      <link>http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/humor/ATT_Copyright_true.html</link>
      <description>One of the fun examples among all the copyright fuss is the  extreme  example
of  copyright claims made by AT&amp;amp;T some time in the 1980s.  It&amp;#39;s the /bin/true
program.  This is a &amp;quot;dummy&amp;quot; library program whose main function is to make it
easy  to  write  infinite  loops  (while true do ...) in shells scripts.  The
&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit  status.   This
can  be  done with an empty file that&amp;#39;s marked executable, and that&amp;#39;s what it
was in the earliest unix system  libraries.   Such  an  empty  file  will  be
interpreted  as  a  shell  script  that  does nothing, and since it does this
successfully, the shell exits with a zero exit status.   But  AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s  lawyers
decided that this was worthy of copyright protection.</description>

      <title>Teach Your Kids Bridge - Speculative Branches</title>
      <link>https://specbranch.com/posts/teach-bridge/</link>
      <description>A post recently made the rounds on hacker news claiming that
you should teach your kids poker, not chess.
The comments on that post go through a lot of the reasons why poker is a bad game to teach your
children, but I felt that I was well suited to opine on this topic, and explain why duplicate
bridge is the best game for practicing the life skills involved in business and programming,
compared to all of the alternatives.</description>
