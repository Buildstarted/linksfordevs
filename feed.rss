      <title>David Swenson&amp;#39;s electrostatic &amp;quot;invisible wall&amp;quot; (1996)</title>
      <link>http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/e-wall.html</link>
      <description>echisholm 5/2016


Have a relative (sort of) who works at a 3M plant. Shit still occasionally 
happens.
&amp;gt; You can&amp;#39;t just say that and go away!! How are you not irresistibly 
&amp;gt; interested in that?? I would&amp;#39;ve interrogated that relative so hard
It just came up in passing at Thanksgiving! I don&amp;#39;t really know him 
that 
well; he&amp;#39;s an in-law. He mentioned being able to throw small washers and 
bolts at the field and watching them get repelled. People got 
interested, and so someone came with a voltmeter, and after throwing a 
couple more, they checked for voltage, and there was a residual charge 
after they finally caught on on a plastic sheet to prevent immediate 
grounding. It also had a very slight magnetic field. It&amp;#39;s apparently 
fairly common, but engineering hasn&amp;#39;t come up with a solid explanation 
why.</description>
