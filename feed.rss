      <description>Redis is a popular choice for caching data, but its capabilities go far beyond that. One of its lesser-known features is Pub/Sub support. Redis channels offer an interesting approach for implementing real-time messaging in your .NET applications.</description>

      <title>Evolving Languages Faster with Type Tailoring</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-07-15_type_tailoring/</link>
      <description>Programming languages are too slow! I’m not talking about execution speed—I’m talking about evolution speed. Programmers are always building new libraries and embedded DSLs, but the host programming language—particularly its type system—doesn’t understand the domain-specific aspects of these things.</description>

      <title>Why Attend Programming Conferences?</title>
      <link>https://haakonhr.gitlab.io/2024-pycon.html</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m sitting on a barely delayed1 train on my way back from PyCon &amp;#39;24 in Berlin. This was the second time I attended an industry/programming conference, after attending JupyterCon last year. This year I had to convince my manager to get the greenlight to go, so I thought I would write down my thoughts about why it&amp;#39;s worth going to conferences and how I can convince my manager next year.</description>

      <title>How I Use Git Worktrees</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2024/07/25/git-worktrees.html</link>
      <description>There are a bunch of posts on the internet about using git worktree command. As far as I can tell,
most of them are primarily about using worktrees as a replacement of, or a supplement to git
branches. Instead of switching branches, you just change directories. This is also how I originally
had used worktrees, but that didn&amp;#39;t stick, and I abandoned them. But recently worktrees grew
on me, though my new use-case is unlike branching.</description>
