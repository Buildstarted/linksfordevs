      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=RLsJiOPx85Y</link>
      <description>You want to help. It feels good to take action, drive for results, and be recognized for it. You're trying to do the right thing.

But it's not scaling. In fact, you've now become the bottleneck.

You're the team hero.

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>Structured Concurrency in Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://max.xz.ax/blog/structured-concurrency-robot-control/</link>
      <description>Robots need a way to control their various mechanisms to perform tasks, either step-by-step, or in parallel. Most FTC teams do this in a similar way. You might occasionally see some teams playing around with custom task queues and callbacks, but they usually have the same idea at the core: they allow the robot to work on a specific task repeatedly in a non-blocking manner and return so that the caller can run some other logic in parallel while the mechanisms make progress. But our new library, Shuttle, is weird. If we wanted to execute two tasks in parallel, we would write this:</description>

      <title>Thoughts of SaaS services</title>
      <link>https://openinx.github.io/posts/2025-05-11-us-saas/</link>
      <description>I have been working at a US company for almost a month recently. An interesting fact is that I have counted the SaaS services I have used for specific scenarios since joining, and surprisingly, there are as many as 23 of them. All of these SaaS services are provided by third-party companies. In other words, Databricks is a customer of all these companies. This aroused my curiosity and made me want to learn about the situation of these companies.</description>

      <title>My Experience with PSP Development</title>
      <link>https://samueleamato.xyz/post/my-experience-with-psp-development</link>
      <description>The console that has stayed with me even twenty years later is the PlayStation Portable. I still love this mobile device for various reasons.
        PSP is small enough to fit in a pocket and can be used on the move, which makes it incredibly convenient. In addition to that, it also
        has audio outputs and excellent multimedia features. It serves as an MP3 player, thus making it a versatile entertainment gadget.
        In terms of hardware, the device itself is impressive because of its bright screen, long-lasting battery, and expandable storage via Memory Stick Duo cards.
        All these features make the PSP stand out till now.</description>

      <title>You Just Don't Need Tox</title>
      <link>https://lukasatkinson.de/2025/just-dont-tox/</link>
      <description>Tox is a neat tool for helping test Python projects.
It automatically creates ‚Äúvirtual environments‚Äù that include the necessary dependencies,
and can then run user-defined tools for testing.
Multiple environments can be created in a declarative manner to test different combinations of Python versions + dependencies.
Tox will also build packages in an isolated environment.</description>

      <link>https://cacm.acm.org/practice/systems-correctness-practices-at-amazon-web-services/</link>
      <description>Amazon Web Services (AWS) strives to deliver reliable services that customers can trust completely. This requires maintaining the highest standards of security, durability, integrity, and availability‚Äîwith systems correctness serving as the cornerstone for achieving these priorities. An April 2015 article published in Communications of the ACM, titled ‚ÄúHow Amazon Web Services Uses Formal Methods,‚Äù highlighted the approach for ensuring the correctness of critical services that have since become among the most widely used by AWS customers.21</description>

- or ‚ÄúThe Turk‚Äù as people called it - was an autonomous chess-playing machine. Built in 1770, it went on tour across parts of the world for 84 years as a robot playing chess against human opponents.</description>
