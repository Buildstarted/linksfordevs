      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-7/</link>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/</link>
      <description>If you’ve ever wanted to use operators with generic types or thought that interfaces could be improved by supporting the ability to define static methods as part of their contract, then this blog post is for you. With .NET 6 we will be shipping a preview of the new generic math and static abstracts in interfaces features.</description>

      <title>Comparing Low-Code Tools as a Developer</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2021/08/10/comparing-low-code-tools-as-a-developer/</link>
      <description>When first hearing of the concept of “no-code” I have to admit I cringed a bit. The implication that a mere mortal client could combine services without ever getting a dev involved seemed cute and definitely wouldn’t lead to anything genuinely valuable.
I come from the age of Hackathons, where a devs would quickly put together really interesting combinations of services in the blink of an eye. They would do all this for nothing more than the joy of building, rather than the offer of expensive prizes from some well funded business as a form of motivation.</description>
