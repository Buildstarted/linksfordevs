      <title>Syncing all the things</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/861978/</link>
      <description>Computing devices are wonderful; they surely must be, since so many
of us have so many of them.  The proliferation of computers leads directly
to a familiar problem, though: the files we want are always on the wrong
machine.  One solution is synchronization services that keep a set of files
up to date across a multitude of machines; a number of companies have
created successful commercial offerings based on such services.  Some of
us, though, are stubbornly resistant to the idea of placing our data in the
hands of corporations and their proprietary systems.  For those of us who
would rather stay in control of our data, systems like Syncthing offer a possible solution.</description>

      <title>The history of passing a null pointer as the key name to Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210723-00/?p=105479</link>
      <description>For decades, the documentation for the Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex function said The lpSubKey parameter can be NULL only if hKey is one of the predefined keys. This statement was true when it was written. In 1992. For Windows NT 3.5, the behavior of the Reg&amp;#173;Open&amp;#173;Key&amp;#173;Ex function was revised so that passing NULL as the lpSubKey is equivalent to passing an empty string.</description>

      <description>PLONK is the state of the art when it comes to general-purpose proof system. While it was released in 2019, the paper has recently received some updates, and the scheme is still evolving (with Aztec announcing an UltraPLONK version coming soon). This is the scheme that we use at Mina to compress the size of the blockchain from gigabytes to a fixed size of a dozen kilobytes.

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Mark Rendle to chat about his experiences live-coding/streaming on Twitch! Warning: We went on a lot of tangents during the conversation! It’s all good though - as they were all awesome tangents! We not only talked about streaming, but also Blazor, C#, Unity, the rate of tech advancement, teaching kids to code, and much more!
  Mark’s Bio Mark Rendle decided he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10, became a professional programmer when he was 16, and is still a programmer 30 years later.</description>

      <description>Now that Visual Studio Code has an in-built JavaScript debugger, it has become incredibly convenient to debug your project without leaving the editor. You can debug JavaScript, tweak CSS and the DOM and interact with the browser Console right inside VS Code. And you don’t need to know which extensions to install as the editor guides you along the way.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach from GPT-3 Copilot to improve developer productivity – The Bugout.dev Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.bugout.dev/2021/07/22/an-alternative-approach-from-gpt-3-copilot-to-improve-developer-productivity/</link>

Copilot, a dev productivity tool from GitHub and OpenAI however, has different user interfaces that are more accommodating to a user. But…</description>

      <title>&amp;quot;In the age of information, ignorance is a choice.&amp;quot; Or is it?</title>
      <link>https://blog.gianlucamauro.com/post/ignorance/</link>
      <description>Six years ago I read this sentence by Donny Miller and became obsessed with it. “In the age of information, ignorance is a choice”. This is the age of information. I felt empowered, inspired, and most of all, I thought it was true as well.
I am a living example of how this can be true. I have a formal Engineering education, a luxury for many families. Yet, the concepts I learned during my engineering education contribute to maybe 1% of what I do today to earn a living.</description>
