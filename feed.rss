      <title>Deprecating scp</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/835962/9696cdf951f59d63/</link>
      <description>The scp
command, which uses the SSH protocol to
copy files between 
machines, is deeply wired into the fingers of many Linux users and
developers — doubly so for those of us who still think of it as a more
secure replacement for rcp.  Many users may be surprised to learn,
though, that the resemblance to rcp goes beyond the name; much of
the underlying protocol is the same as well.  That protocol is showing its
age, and the OpenSSH community has
considered it deprecated for a while. 
Replacing scp in a way that keeps users happy may not be an easy
task, though.</description>

      <title>Standing on Our Own Two Feet</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html</link>
      <description>When a new Certificate Authority (CA) comes on the scene, it faces a conundrum: In order to be useful to people, it needs its root certificate to be trusted by a wide variety of operating systems (OSes) and browsers. However, it can take years for the OSes and browsers to accept the new root certificate, and even longer for people to upgrade their devices to the newer versions that include that change.</description>

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqPXcv-IE0k</link>
      <description>Since my latest video “YouTube&amp;#39;s Fake Animal Rescue Channels” I decided to do a bit more digging in the fake animal rescue genre. And what I found was a disturbing connection between multiple channels, that seems to be a legitimate animal abuse ring right here on YouTube.

The Channels Discussed:
KM Daily
Happy Dog
The Rescue Journey TV
pabloxito17
Love Rescue Animals
yorquy
Animal Lighthouse
Little Furry Friends
Animal SafeGaurd
The Rescue Journey

MUSIC USED:

      <title>Optimization: what I did to make the game 300 times faster</title>
      <link>https://thesaplinggame.com/devlogs/optimization.html</link>
      <description>A major point of feedback for evolution simulator The Sapling is that the players wanted larger levels. To make this possible, I spent three months optimizing the underlying game engine. This article is an in-depth explanation of one of the main insights I had. There are several interactive simulations you can play with in your browser to get a deeper understanding of how everything works.</description>
