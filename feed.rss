      <title>LiteDB - A .NET embedded NoSQL database</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/d376a46c-ec5b-4e37-81b3-23772c47ed85</link>
      <description>In this article we will have a closer look at LiteDB, a .NET NoSQL Document Store in a single data file. We will discover the advantages of LiteDB and why it is a viable candidate for your next project.
We will also explore what are the differences between a NoSQL and a classical SQL database are and what this has to do with the reminiscent SQL CE or the more modern SQLite database.

      <title>JavaScript metaprogramming with the 2022-03 decorators API</title>
      <link>https://2ality.com/2022/10/javascript-decorators.html</link>
      <description>JavaScript decorators have finally reached stage 3! Their latest version is already supported by Babel and will soon be supported by TypeScript. This blog post covers the 2022-03 version (stage 3) of the ECMAScript proposal “Decorators” by Daniel Ehrenberg and Chris Garrett. In principle, decorators are a JavaScript feature for library authors: They let them define @-prefixed keywords that can be put in front of classes and various class members (such as methods) and change how these constructs work – for example: @freeze class C {} The decorator @freeze changes class C so that all of its instances are frozen. We’ll implement this decorator later. Users of libraries profit indirectly from decorators because they get features that are based on them. Decorators are mostly an object-oriented feature and popular in OOP frameworks and libraries such as Ember, Angular, Vue, web component frameworks and MobX. In this blog post, we learn how decorators work and use our knowledge to implement several of them.</description>

      <title>A deep dive into endpoint filters in ASP.NET Core 7</title>
      <link>https://blog.safia.rocks/endpoint-filters-exploration.html</link>
      <description>One of the features that I worked on as part of the ASP.NET Core 7 release was support for endpoint filters in minimal APIs. I recently shared some of the internals of the implementation at a recent Ignite presentation, but I figured I would share the insights in a blog as well. If you’re more of a visual or audio learner, you might find the video presentation helpful.</description>

      <title>Killing one bird with two-and-a-half stones in Mac OS X Mail - Tech Reflect</title>
      <link>https://techreflect.net/2022/10/killing-one-bird-with-two-and-a-half-stones-in-mac-os-x-mail/</link>
      <description>This story is important to me because it was the first software I ever wrote that shipped to more than just a few friends or colleagues. What started as some scripting turned into Cocoa development, which is not something I ever expected to find myself doing. It never became a full-time thing for me, but it was a fun journey. Note: I joined the Mail team in June 2000, three months before the Public Beta. We shipped the first “real” version of Mac OS X (10.0) nine months later. On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).&amp;#160;The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers.&amp;#160;While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac... Read More Read More</description>

      <title>Python isn’t Used in Prod</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/10/19/python-isnt-used-in-prod/</link>
      <description>I watched a video earlier this week by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. It’s an entertaining walkthrough of some impressive optimisation of his own Python code by his community but there’s a comment about Python that I thought warranted some pushback.
That comment was that ‘Python will very rarely make it into production’. The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work.</description>
