      <title>Note taking system should be simple</title>
      <link>https://liyafu.com/2024-02-04-note-taking-system-should-be-simple/</link>
      <description>No note-taking app is perfect. Apps like Evernote, Notion, Obsidian, and Logseq each have their own advantages but can be complex and packed with unnecessary features. Finding the ideal app is impossible, and transferring data between apps is challenging due to differing data formats. Even with promises from providers not to misuse your data, it&amp;#39;s uncertain how it might be used for commercial purposes.</description>

      <title>Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-i-use-the-gpl-and-not-cuck-licenses/</link>
      <description>Every piece of software I write I license under the GNU Public License Version 3 (GPLv3) unless I have forked it from something else.
The GPLv3 is the premiere copyleft license, meaning that it not only allows users to run, modify and distribute their own versions of what I write, but it also requires that no one in that chain of development restrict and close-source that software: it and software deriving from it must forever remain open, usable and sharable.</description>

      <title>Timeline of the xz open source attack</title>
      <link>https://research.swtch.com/xz-timeline</link>
      <description>Over a period of over two years, an attacker using the name “Jia Tan”
worked as a diligent, effective contributor to the xz compression library,
eventually being granted commit access and maintainership.
Using that access, they installed a very subtle, carefully hidden backdoor into liblzma,
a part of xz that also happens to be a dependency of OpenSSH sshd
on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and other systemd-based Linux systems.
That backdoor watches for the attacker sending hidden commands at the start of an SSH session,
giving the attacker the ability to run an arbitrary command on the target system without logging in:
unauthenticated, targeted remote code execution.</description>
