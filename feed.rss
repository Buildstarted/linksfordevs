      <title>Memory Safe ‘curl’ for a More Secure Internet</title>
      <link>https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/memory-safe-curl/</link>
      <description>Memory safety vulnerabilities represent one of the biggest threats to Internet security. As such, we at ISRG are interested in finding ways to make the most heavily relied-upon software on the Internet memory safe. Today we’re excited to announce that we’re working with Daniel Stenberg, author of ubiquitous curl software, and WolfSSL, to make critical parts of the curl codebase memory safe.
ISRG is funding Daniel to work on adding support for Hyper as an HTTP back-end for curl.</description>

      <title>If Worker Pay Had Kept Pace With Productivity Gains Since 1968, Today&amp;#39;s Minimum Wage Would Be $24 an Hour</title>

      <description>In such a world, a full-time minimum wage worker would be earning $48,000 a year in the United States... If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12 an hour today, more than 65 percent higher than the national minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While this would make a huge difference in the lives of many people earning close to the national minimum wage, it is actually a relatively unambitious target.</description>

      <title>Blazor in Action</title>
      <link>https://www.manning.com/books/blazor-in-action</link>
      <description>An example-driven guide to building reusable UI components and web frontends—all with Blazor, C#, and .NET.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

With Blazor WebAssembly, you can also run your C# code natively in the browser.</description>
