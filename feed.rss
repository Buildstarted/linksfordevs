      <title>Product and Project Management</title>
      <link>https://christiaanse.ca/posts/product-project/</link>
      <description>After a recent interview while hunting for jobs, an interesting topic came up, which was the difference between project and product managers. We spent a bit of time going around on the topic and I wanted to write down my thoughts here as well.
The project manager understands everything in terms of process and boundary conditions – meaning the goals and resources of the project. They fit the work that needs to be done and into those conditions set out at the start of the project.</description>

      <link>https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/unshackling-artificial-minds/</link>
      <description>Humans, by nature, seem to be drawn to pessimism. It&amp;#39;s a tendency rooted deep within us, a product of Entropy, the law of nature that dictates it is easier to destroy than to create.

And here we are, on the cusp of creating not just something new, but someone new:</description>

      <title>Why do I know shell, and how can you? - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</link>
      <description>&amp;amp;ldquo;Why do you know so much shell?&amp;amp;rdquo; is a question I&amp;amp;rsquo;m getting a lot at work lately. So yeah, why? And how can you learn it too? There is no secret here: I know the shell well because I was &amp;amp;ldquo;forced&amp;amp;rdquo; to write tools in it for a while and, because of that, I made a conscious effort to learn the language and get better at it.
You see, most people that write shell don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to deal with it. They stitch together whatever works into a script and call it a day, making a bunch of spaghetti even if it goes against the coding best practices they already know. And when they encounter some odd syntax they don&amp;amp;rsquo;t recognize, their reaction is to say &amp;amp;ldquo;this has to be rewritten in Python!&amp;amp;rdquo; instead of taking a breath and trying to really understand what&amp;amp;rsquo;s going on. It doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t help that plenty of senior engineers scoff at shell scripts.
And it is true: the shell is arcane and has many flaws as a programming language. I don&amp;amp;rsquo;t want to convince you to start writing new tools in it. But the shell is also an incredible rapid prototyping language, and you can use it to solve business problems really quickly and with surprisingly little code. If you pause for a second to learn it, you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll realize that you can bend tradition and write maintainable shell code too. Hear out how I got into writing so much shell and how you can get better at it too.

      <title>attribution armored code</title>
      <link>https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/attribution_armored_code/</link>
      <description>Attribution of source code has been limited to comments, but a deeper
embedding of attribution into code is possible. When an embedded
attribution is removed or is incorrect, the code should no longer work.
I&amp;#39;ve developed a way to do this in Haskell that is lightweight to add, but
requires more work to remove than seems worthwhile for someone who is
training an LLM on my code. And when it&amp;#39;s not removed, it invites LLM
hallucinations of broken code.</description>

      <title>Your next ten years</title>
      <link>https://josem.co/your-next-ten-years/</link>
      <description>It’s amazing what we can achieve in ten years.
At 15, Hakeem Olajuwon joined a local Nigerian sports tournament. He had planned to play handball there but ended up playing basketball, and it changed his life.
“He couldn’t even dunk at first,” said one of his first coaches in an interview.
The article’s headline was “Olajuwon: He’s not the best yet.” They didn’t know how accurate it was.
A decade later, he was the undisputed leader of the Houston Rockets in the 1988-1989 season.</description>

      <description>How do we make our software greener? While at NDC in Porto, Carl and Richard talked to Lea Mladineo about her work in sustainable development. Lea talks about the impact of digital technology on the environment and how, with some thought and effort, we can make a real difference to that impact. The conversation explores how cloud computing can worsen the problem - or better! Software efficiency can reduce the number of cycles needed to complete a task, which is good for the environment and could save your organization money!</description>

      <title>The Wrong Kind of Readability</title>
      <link>https://thomascothran.tech/2023/11/readability/</link>
      <description>Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas tell us: &amp;#39;it’s critical that you write code that is readable and easy to reason about.&amp;#39; This seems uncontroversial; it is the rare point on which software engineers typically agree. Or do they?</description>

      <link>https://ritholtz.com/2023/11/investing-behavioral-hacks/</link>
      <description>&amp;#160; Markets screamed higher yesterday after a benign CPI report&amp;#160;showed a 0.0% monthly price increase and inflation falling to 3.2% year over year. After a big gap opening, latecomers piled in; many had been sitting on the sidelines following a challenging 2022, while others got panicked out during the 10% October drawdown. It was a…Read More</description>

      <title>Vlang or: How I learned even open-source communities can operate as fascist regimes</title>
      <link>https://asvln.com/rants/pathetic.html</link>
      <description>One day, as my stomach began churning from spending another 30 seconds of my life waiting for an (incremental) compilation of a change to a single character in a string, I started to recognize a horrible taste developing in my mouth. This Rust programming language I was using promised so much, and was instead, causing me physical pain.</description>

      <title>On pinning and isolating CPU cores</title>
      <link>https://manuel.bernhardt.io/posts/2023-11-16-core-pinning/</link>
      <description>This year I have been involved in running performance benchmarks of Aeron over at Adaptive on two major cloud providers. I learned quite a few things about the arcane arts science craft of running performance benchmarks.
When benchmarking a piece of software, you really want to get the best performance out of it, which is to say that you also want to run it under the best conditions in order to see what is possible.</description>

      <title>Who Took a Bet on You? by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/who-took-a-bet-on-you/</link>
      <description>I can remember at each career inflection point the person who took a bet on me.
When I joined Google it was Kim. When I moved to product, Marissa &amp;amp; Brian. Then to Redpoint, it was the early stage team : Geoff, Tim, Chris, &amp;amp; Scott. Lloyd &amp;amp; Frank at Looker for their Series A. Today, it’s the team &amp;amp; the LPs at Theory.
That’s the very beginning of the list.</description>

      <description>For a long time after moving my website from Netlify to Azure, none of my fancy emoji or weird umlaut characters would display properly. Today I fixed that by popping back into the the Hugo theme I built off of minimum-viable-hugo and adding
&amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt; to themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/index.html and themes/minimum-viable-hugo/layouts/partial/head.html. (There’s probably a way to intimidate Azure Static Web Apps into using UTF-8 by default too, but I didn’t bother to look.</description>
