I find the YX problem much more frustrating: where software people decide that they want to answer question Y even though what someone asks is question X.</description>

      <title>Conversational Spaced Repetition | David Bieber</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/</link>
      <description>I learn a lot from talking to large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude. Frequently I’ll ask the LLM to quiz me on what it’s taught me, in order to test my understanding of what I’ve learned. I find that doing so helps me learn the material better, promoting longer term recall. Even with this strategy in place, however, I still forget a lot of what I’ve learned from these AI assistants.</description>

      <description>Over the course of 2023-ish I wrote two Python frameworks (1) (1)I’d like to avoid a semantic debate, but for clarity’s sake when I say, “framework” I mean a library that holistically and generically targets the way you write applications (or tests in the case of sundew) rather than providing a narrow set of functionality. I think there is some unique consideration you have to have when targeting the whole way a developer builds software, but by I expect these learnings are things that would apply to development of any kind of library that you intend other people to use.</description>

      <description>I like using one machine and setup for everything, from serious development work to hobby projects to managing my finances. This is very convenient, as often the lines between these are blurred. But it is also scary if I think of the large number of people who I have to trust to not want to extract all my personal data. Whenever I run a cabal install, or a fun VSCode extension gets updated, or anything like that, I am running code that could be malicious or buggy.</description>

      <title>More options for apps distributed in the European Union - Latest News - Apple Developer</title>
      <link>https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8c1m8hqt</link>
      <description>We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.More flexibilityDevelopers who’ve agreed to the Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU have new options for their apps in the EU:
Alternative app marketplaces. Marketplaces can choose to offer a catalog of apps solely from the developer of the marketplace.
Linking out to purchase. When directing users to complete a transaction for digital goods or services on an external webpage, developers can choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals. The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimized for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional. 
Distributing directly from your websiteWeb Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer. Apple will provide authorized developers access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of their apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more. For details, visit Getting ready for Web Distribution in&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;EU. </description>

      <title>Effect Sizes and Asymmetry | Andrey Akinshin</title>
      <link>https://aakinshin.net/posts/asymmetry-es/</link>
      <description>Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s d is one of the most popular measures of the effect size. Unfortunately, it was designed for the normal distribution, which may make it a misleading measure in the non-normal case. And the real distributions are never normal. When we discuss d...</description>

      <title>Breaking Down Tasks - Jacob Kaplan-Moss</title>
      <link>https://jacobian.org/2024/mar/11/breaking-down-tasks/</link>
      <description>Something missing from this series on estimation, until now, has been a discussion of how to “break down” a project into a well-defined task list. I’d not previously written about this because, to me, it’s largely intuitive. But it isn’t for everyone, so this post fills the gap, and explains in detail how I break down projects into a task list.</description>

      <title>Cloning a laptop over NVME TCP</title>
      <link>https://copyninja.in/blog/clone_laptop_nvmet.html</link>
      <description>Recently, I got a new laptop and had to set it up so I could start using it. But I wasn&amp;#39;t really in the mood to go through the same old steps which I had explained in this post earlier. I was complaining about this to my colleague, and there came the suggestion of why not copy the entire disk to the new laptop. Though it sounded like an interesting idea to me, I had my doubts, so here is what I told him in return.</description>

      <description>Ensuring code quality and reliability is crucial in software development. MediatR, a popular library for the in-process request/response pattern, simplifies component communication but requires thorough testing. Unit testing with MediatR offers a swift way to validate development, and contrary to popular belief, it speeds up development by detecting bugs</description>
