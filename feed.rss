      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Jeremy Likness on Working with Data on .NET - Episode 141</title>
      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/jeremy-likness-on-working-with-data-on-net-episode-141</link>
      <description>This week, Jeffrey Palermo is joined by return guest, Jeremy Likness! Jeremy is an internationally selling author, keynote speaker, and professional coder with a personal mission to empower developers to be their best! He has worked on commercial enterprise software for 25 years and specializes in web technology. Currently, he is also a Sr. Cloud Developer Advocate for Microsoft, but previously held roles at iVision, Wintellect, and AirWatch. &amp;amp;nbsp; Last year when Jeremy was on the podcast last, they discussed DevOps automation. In this episode, they focus the discussion on working with data on .NET. Jeremy shares about the work that he had been doing on the .NET Data team for the last year, Entity Framework Core, Microsoft Dataverse, GraphQL, and more! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes. [:51] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:28] About today’s episode with Jeremy Likness. [1:53] Jeffrey welcomes Jeremy back to the podcast! [2:15] Jeremy gives an overview of his role as the Senior Program Manager working on .NET Data and the work that his team does. [5:37] About Microsoft Dataverse and Jeremy and his team have been working with the Azure Storage and Dataverse teams. [8:28] Of the different methods of working with data in C#, what’s the general distribution? Which methods have greater adoption? [11:17] Jeremy and Jeffrey discuss different .NET project types and whether Entity Framework 5.0 the latest stable release. [11:55] Jeremy shares what is most exciting to him with this upcoming .NET release. [13:25] What’s the go-to store on the client-side? [16:04] The new inheritance strategies in EFCore: are they fully implemented and ready? [19:21] Jeremy talks about the focus on speed for EFCore 6. [21:37] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [22:08] Why developers are “forced” to learn object-oriented programming through EFCore’s features. [24:32] How Jeremy goes about testing code that uses Entity Framework. [27:30] Jeremy highlights where to access invaluable EFCore resources. [28:54] Jeremy touches on how the EF code team uses ReSharper. [29:15] What GraphQL is and why it might be useful if you have a .NET application. [32:40] Jeremy highlights another good QL platform: Hot Chocolate by ChilliCream. [34:06] The architecture of GraphQL and whether it is a database engine or a library. [35:33] If you have a .NET app running in App Service and you’ve already got Azure SQL, and you want to get some of your data and use Graph QL, is this a new Azure resource? Architecturally, what would you do to adopt this? [39:18] Jeffrey thanks for Jeremy for joining the podcast! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!   (Sponsor)  — Available on Amazon!  — Click here to download the .NET DevOps for Azure ebook!   — Follow to stay informed about future events!

      <title>Willfulness</title>
      <link>https://gazzini.com/essays/posts/willfulness/</link>
      <description>I want to live a virtuous life, and I want to have a positive impact on the world. In practice, these are 2 very different goals.
The former is intrinsic — the act is its own reward, and I don’t have to claim responsibility for any external outcomes. The latter is results-oriented, so my noble intentions must clash with the messy compromise of reality. For this reason, high-impact people often seem less virtuous… especially in the “humility” department.</description>

      <link>https://gomakethings.com/accessibility-is-hard.-its-also-your-job./</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago, Twitter use @McgarrDana tweeted:
 Accessibility isn’t more work, you were just cutting corners before. The work was incomplete.
 And she’s right! If what you built isn’t accessible, it’s not complete.
There’s no such thing as a website or web app that doesn’t need to be accessible. If you’re a web developer, accessibility is literally your job. If you ignore it, you’re just a hobbyist.</description>
