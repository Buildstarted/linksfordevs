      <title>Magnon-based computation could signal computing paradigm shift</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2023-03-magnon-based-paradigm-shift.html</link>
      <description>Like electronics or photonics, magnonics is an engineering subfield that aims to advance information technologies when it comes to speed, device architecture, and energy consumption. A magnon corresponds to the specific amount of energy required to change the magnetization of a material via a collective excitation called a spin wave.</description>

      <description>Contrary to Betteridge’s Law of Tabloid Headlines, the answer is “yes,” but context is important. I get this question so often that I thought it was time to get some stats on it.</description>

      <title>Extending Structural Functions to Scalars</title>
      <link>https://www.dyalog.com/blog/2023/04/extending-structural-functions-to-scalars/</link>
      <description>Traditionally, the set of monadic reversing or reflecting primitives,&amp;#160;Reverse-First (⊖), Transpose (⍉), and Reverse&amp;#160;(⌽) apply to entire arrays and are defined as identity functions on scalar arguments. Dyalog v19.0 extends the definitions to provide equivalent reflections on scalars.</description>

      <title>Notion as a replacement for Pocket — Javorov&amp;#233; l&amp;#237;stky</title>
      <link>https://honzajavorek.cz/blog/notion-as-a-replacement-for-pocket/</link>
      <description>I know Notion exists, but until now I didn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to it.
With my recent transition from social media and Pocket to good old RSS feeds, I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a way to save random internet articles to a single feed, which I could then put to my RSS reader.</description>

      <title>Michael Tsai - Blog - HomePod Late Adopter</title>
      <link>https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/03/31/homepod-late-adopter/</link>
      <description>We’ve been using an Amazon Echo Dot in our kitchen for several years, principally for timers and answering basic questions. Lately, it has not been responding as reliably. Also, it never worked well as a Bluetooth speaker for my iPhone because the phone would always reconnect to the Echo, even when I was in a different room trying to use my AirPods or just the built-in speaker. I decided to finally give HomePod a try and ordered a HomePod mini about a month ago. This is my experience as someone who has read about HomePod and Home.app since the beginning but never actually used them until now.</description>

      <title>Moving from Rust to C++</title>
      <link>https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2023/04/01/rust-to-cpp.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.</description>
