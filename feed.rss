      <title>Jevons Paradox &amp; The Rebound Effect</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfwhbfMnNc</link>
      <description>When efficiency increases, consumption drops, right? Errr... No.. So far, increased efficiency has mostly lead to increased consumption.  

This is called Jevons Paradox, discovered by William Stanley Jevons in 1865. He was concerned that improved steam engines would make England run out of coal faster!

      <description>Thanks to the developers of checkra1n and Corellium I was able to port PostmarketOS to the iPhone 7. Since I was only able to transfer small kernel images to the Phone, I only tested a very minimal PostmarketOS installation, but it is booting :)</description>

      <description>COBOL is in the news again.¬†Millions of people¬†are filing unemployment claims nearly all at once, and the systems to process them are failing. Why? They need to scale to unprecedented levels, they‚Äôre written in COBOL, and‚Ä¶¬†we don‚Äôt have enough COBOL programmers.</description>

      <title>San Francisco, California and the 1918-1919 Influenza Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://www.influenzaarchive.org/cities/city-sanfrancisco.html</link>
      <description>As in every city, it is impossible to know just how the first case of influenza was contracted in San Francisco. According to contemporary newspaper reports, however, a local man who had returned to his home after a recent trip to Chicago brought the disease to San Francisco. Learning of the case on September 23, San Francisco Health Officer Dr. William C. Hassler ordered the man to the city hospital and placed his home under quarantine. The hope was that these actions might stop the spread of the disease in its tracks, sparing San Francisco from an epidemic. However, by October 9 the city had at least 169 cases of influenza. Only a week later that number had jumped to over 2,000. San Francisco‚Äôs epidemic had started.1</description>

      <title>IT'S TIME TO BUILD - Andreessen Horowitz</title>
      <link>https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/</link>
      <description>Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it's not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it... Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. We built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that's to build.</description>

      <title>Enjoy Local Development with Tye, Docker, and .NET</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/local-dev-with-tye-docker-and-dotnet</link>
      <description>As developers, we have an arsenal of technologies at our disposal. While using new technologies can make us more productive, setting them up can drain us of enthusiasm and stunt our creative momentum. Container technologies, especially Docker, have blunted a lot of the pain inflicted by continuous yak-shaving. As .NET developers, we‚Äôve benefited greatly from the cross-platform efforts of the teams at Microsoft.</description>
