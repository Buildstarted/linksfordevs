      <title>How I used .NET 9 and AI to charge my electric car</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=SGSBZhbIX2E</link>
      <description>Can you use .NET 9 to charge your electric car using solar power? Absolutely! In this session, Johnny will show you how to leverage your development skills and .NET 9 to combine data from external vendors by using their API&amp;#39;s and be smart with that data to command your electric vehicle to charge when the time is right. Johnny even added some AI to the mix to be able to ask questions about the current charging state using Azure OpenAI for the LLM, Semantic Kernel to create a custom copilot, and Azure Cognitive Services for Speech-To-Text. This demo is not something that is put together for this talk, it is a cloud-native distributed application used by Johnny on a day-to-day basis.

But to be fair, WordPress has given me a platform to build my content on -- even as far back as 2013 when I first started.

But we&amp;#39;re breaking up. We&amp;#39;re through.

It&amp;#39;s time to get everything moved over to... BLAZOR!
