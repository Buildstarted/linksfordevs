I boosted several posts about this already, but since people keep asking if I've seen it....

MITRE has announced that its funding for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program and related programs, including the Common Weakness Enumeration Program, will expire on April 16. The CVE database is critical for anyone doing vulnerability management or security research, and for a whole lot of other uses. There isn't really anyone else left who does this, and it's typically been work that is paid for and supported by the US government, which is a major consumer of this information, btw.

I reached out to MITRE, and they confirmed it is for real. Here is the contract, which is through the Department of Homeland Security, and has been renewed annually on the 16th or 17th of April.

https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001

MITRE's CVE database is likely going offline tomorrow. They have told me that for now, historical CVE records will be available at GitHub, https://github.com/CVEProject

Yosry Barsoum, vice president and director at MITRE's Center for Securing the Homeland, said:

“On Wednesday, April 16, 2025, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) Program, will expire.  The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.”</description>

      <title>CVE program faces swift end after DHS fails to renew contract, leaving security flaw tracking in limbo</title>

      <description>MITRE’s 25-year-old Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program will end April 16 after DHS did not renew its funding contract for reasons unspecified. Experts say ending the program, which served as the crux for most cybersecurity defense programs, is a tragedy.</description>

      <title>Four weeks of voice computing - here's what I learnt</title>
      <link>https://www.fileside.app/blog/2025-04-14_voice-computing/</link>
      <description>After a recent flare-up of RSI-related wrist pain, I decided to make a serious attempt at becoming proficient at speech computing. My hope was to be able to add an alternative input method in order to offload my hands, and allow them some rest even during my daily work. I’m now four weeks in and this post summarises my impressions. The journey has had its fair share of frustrations, but also brought some surprising insights.</description>

      <description>Growing up, I was a nerd — a mathelete to be precise. I idolized the great scientists and mathematicians, not so much the great statesmen or politicians. That's why I found myself in tech and Silicon Valley — a place where us matheletes can make and bring to life what we imagine. And, what better place to make things than a startup, where ostensibly we are unfettered in our technical pursuits.</description>

      <description>Cross-compiling is taking a computer program and compiling it for a machine that isn’t the one hosting the compilation. Although historically compilers would only compile for the host machine, this is considered an anachronism: all serious native compilers are now cross-compilers.</description>

      <title>Coffee and Open Source Conversation - Dave Grundgeiger</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=JPzuCAnxtBs</link>
      <description>Based in Los Angeles, Dave has dedicated his career to solving complex technical challenges across various domains. His professional journey includes roles as Principal Software Architect at PKWARE, Senior Backend Engineer at Fetch Rewards, and Staff Software Engineer at Bold Penguin, where he consistently designed high-performance, scalable systems.

Dave's current passion project, Contextium, represents the culmination of his technical expertise and intellectual interests. This system transforms natural language into deep semantic graphs -- and vice versa -- through innovative knowledge representation techniques. Contextium employs a symbolic, rules-based approach to NLP rather than relying solely on statistical methods, allowing for precise semantic understanding and addressing critical limitations in current AI systems, for example hallucinations in large language models.

A published author with O'Reilly Media, Dave wrote 'Programming Visual Basic .NET' (2001) and 'CDO &amp; MAPI Programming with Visual Basic' (2000), demonstrating his ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly.
Over his long career, Dave has worked in many languages and tech stacks. His interests extend beyond pure engineering to theoretical aspects of AI, consciousness, and the intersection of symbolic and neural approaches to machine intelligence.
