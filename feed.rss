      <title>I Fixed My Slow App Using Sentry Trace Explorer!!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=U4BkIfj_CYw</link>
      <description>Try out Sentry Tracing free for your application, and get 3 months free: https://dub.sh/sentry-milan
Get the source code for this video for FREE → https://the-dotnet-weekly.kit.com/sentry

Want to master Clean Architecture? Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ
Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt

In this video, you'll learn how to integrate Sentry with your ASP.NET Core microservices to gain full visibility into distributed systems. We'll walk through configuring the Sentry SDK using OpenTelemetry, setting up tracing, and solving real-world observability challenges like performance bottlenecks, error propagation, and black box communication between services.

📌 What you'll learn:

- How to configure Sentry in .NET using Sentry.AspNetCore and Sentry.OpenTelemetry
- How to trace requests across microservices using Sentry’s Trace Explorer
- How to debug N+1 problems and API slowdowns using distributed traces
- How to investigate exceptions and trace them across services
- How to use telemetry data to validate fixes in production

We’ll walk through a real eShop microservices system involving an order flow, product validation, and background processing. You'll see how Sentry can pinpoint issues like slow API calls and trace failures back to their root cause—even across asynchronous service boundaries.
