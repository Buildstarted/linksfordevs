      <link>https://atlas.engineer/technical-article/why-lisp.org</link>
      <description>A lot of people ask us the question, why do we choose to use Common Lisp as our primary development language? Often times the question comes disguised as a suggestion: &amp;quot;Flask is a great webserver you should consider using&amp;quot;. This is a well intentioned suggestion- of course we would like to use the best tools available! Below, we&amp;#39;ll do our best to explain why we use Lisp, and why we think it is the best tool for our needs.</description>

      <link>https://boonepeter.github.io/posts/spotify-codes-part-2/</link>
      <description>In part 1 I dove into Spotify Codes and explained the general technical concepts of how they work. If you haven’t read that post you should check it out. I shared it on reddit where it generated a lot of interesting discussion. Ludvig Strigeus, a key early developer at Spotify and the person who invented Spotify Codes, even stopped by and shared some more information on their creation and the rationale behind them!</description>

      <title>Long Range E-Bike &amp;#183; Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/long-range-ebike/</link>
      <description>Electric cars are fantastic compared to ICE vehicles, but E-Bikes are even better. Much lower environmental impact and far more suited to medium range travel such as commuting. Here in NL they sell in huge numbers, far faster than electric cars. But they also have their limitations: a regular e-bike tops out at 25 Kph, and will do a very limited distance on a single charge. What powers your average e-bike are Lithium-Ion cells, usually of the 18650 variety, capacities vary but the very best cells you can get at the moment that are still affordable top out at about 3400 mAh per cell. A typical e-bike has about 40 to 50 of these, in a 10S4P or 10S5P arrangement.</description>

      <title>Using the Online Thumby IDE</title>
      <link>https://tinycircuits.com/blogs/thumby/building-a-game-with-the-thumby-ide</link>
      <description>This tutorial will show you how to build a basic project and upload it to your Thumby using our online IDE!

Materials&amp;#160;
Hardware:&amp;#160;

Micro USB Cable
Thumby


Software:&amp;#160;


Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browsers (other browsers not supported)
TinyCircuits&amp;#160;Thumby Editor IDE website



Background:

Only Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge support running the TinyCircuits&amp;#160;Thumby Editor IDE webpage


Step 1: Assembly (Hardware)
Simply plug in the Thumby to your computer using a Micro USB cable and flip the power switch ON to the right (when looking at the screen).

Step 2: Software (Setup)
Open Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and open the online Thumby IDE, the below screen will appear:

Figure 1: Screen on opening IDE for the first time
If you prefer a light theme, hover over the &amp;#39;Utilities&amp;#39; dropdown in the top bar and left-click &amp;#39;Invert Theme&amp;#39;.

Figure 2:&amp;#160;Light theme
To connect the Thumby,

Click &amp;#39;Connect Thumby&amp;#39; in the top bar
Select the device through the pop-up menu
Click &amp;#39;Connect&amp;#39;

The below screenshot&amp;#160;shows the button locations and order to click them in.
&amp;#160;
Figure 3: Steps to connect Thumby
If connection is successful, a green &amp;#39;Connected&amp;#39; message will be printed to the terminal.
After doing the above steps the Thumby will be paired to the webpage and will auto-connect when &amp;#39;Connect Thumby&amp;#39; is clicked.

With the Thumby connected it is time to upload some code!






Step 3: The Code!


Follow the below steps to start a project and then upload it to Thumby.

Hover over &amp;#39;Project Settings&amp;#39; and left-click &amp;#39;Set Project Name&amp;#39;, set the name to anything you like.


Figure 4:&amp;#160;Left-clicking &amp;#39;Set Project Name&amp;#39; under &amp;#39;Project Settings&amp;#39;


Click &amp;#39;OK&amp;#39; after typing in a name, in this case, we used &amp;#39;HelloWorld&amp;#39; as the name (without quotes).

The Thumby should&amp;#160;be preloaded a &amp;#39;Games&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;lib&amp;#39; folder, each containing files. Left-click any file to open it in a webpage code editor. &amp;#39;thumby.py&amp;#39; in &amp;#39;lib&amp;#39; is the main API that should be used to program your projects.
If you&amp;#39;ve done any exploring of the library files, close those editors by left-clicking the &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; in the header tab of the editor,&amp;#160;see the pink arrow in the below image.

Figure 5:&amp;#160;Closing any open editors
Once all the editors are closed, open a new one by left-clicking &amp;#39;Add New Editor&amp;#39; in the top panel (see the pink arrow in the below image).

Figure 6:&amp;#160;Opening a new editor
Follow the below steps and enter code as you go to program your first project.

import the time and math modules that will be used for animating a sprite with respect to time. Also import the thumby module which implements the main API for interacting with buttons and the screen

import timeimport thumbyimport math

Draw a sprite in the &amp;#39;Bitmap Builder&amp;#39; panel. First, set the width and height to 32px by clicking the &amp;#39;Set Width&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Set Height&amp;#39; buttons in the &amp;#39;Bitmap Builder&amp;#39;
Use mouse left-click to set pixels to black and mouse right-click to set them white
Once the sprite is drawn, select a line in the code editor added earlier, then click the &amp;#39;Export Lines&amp;#39; button in the &amp;#39;Bitmap Builder&amp;#39; panel - see the below image for the result


Figure 7:&amp;#160;Result of drawing a sprite and exporting it to code/Python array

Create a loop where the sprite will be animated bobbing up and down. The first steps every loop are to store the current time in milliseconds and to clear the screen to black.

while(1):
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;t0 = time.ticks_ms() 	&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# Get the current time in ms
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;thumby.display.fill(0)  # Fill the screen to black to give a &amp;#39;blank&amp;#39; canvas

As time goes on create a vertical offset using the sin function. The offset will move the sprite up and down 5px.



&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;bobRate = 250&amp;#160;# How fast the animation is (higher is slower, arbitrary)
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;bobRange = 5&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# The range in pixels of the bob (how far it moves up/down, -5px to 5px)
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# The actual offset incorporating time and range (will be applied to the sprite position)
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;bobOffset = math.sin(t0 / bobRate) * bobRange 



Next, use the Thumby screen width and the width of the bitmap to center and calculate the sprite&amp;#39;s X and Y location



&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# Center the sprite using screen and bitmap dimensions
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# Also apply the bob offset from above
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;spriteX = int((thumby.DISPLAY_W/2) - (32/2))
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;spriteY = int(round((thumby.DISPLAY_H/2) - (32/2) + bobOffset))

The sprite&amp;#160;is drawn on the screen, every loop, using the bitmap data array, the sprite X &amp;amp; Y position, and the sprite dimensions


&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;# Display the bitmap by supplying the bitmap data, position, and bitmap dimensions
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;thumby.display.blit(bitmap1, spriteX, spriteY, 32, 32)
&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;thumby.display.update()
That&amp;#39;s it! Before clicking the &amp;#39;Upload Project&amp;#39; button in the top header, hover over &amp;#39;File&amp;#39; in the code editor and give the file the same name as your project by left-clicking &amp;#39;Rename File&amp;#39;. In this case, the project name is &amp;#39;HelloWorld&amp;#39; so the file was renamed to &amp;#39;HelloWorld.py&amp;#39;.
For your project to show up on the Thumby game select screen, there needs to be one .py file with the same name as the project. Before clicking upload, the webpage and code should look something like the below image:

Figure 8: Setup before clicking upload
Now click the &amp;#39;Upload Project&amp;#39; button on the top of the page, disconnect Thumby, power cycle it (turn off and on), use down on the Thumby dpad to find your project, click the left button to select and execute your main project file.
If the above code was used, the below animation will play after selecting &amp;#39;HelloWorld&amp;#39; in the Thumby select screen:


Other Webpage Features

Execute a single file on the Thumby at root level &amp;#39;/&amp;#39; using the &amp;#39;Fast execute&amp;#39; button in any code editor
Import/export a .py file from/to your computer using the file drop-down in any editor (left-click &amp;#39;File&amp;#39;)
Change the font size of individual editors using the view drop down (left-click &amp;#39;View&amp;#39;)
Delete files or directories on the Thumby by left-clicking in the filesystem panel
Open files stored in Thumby by right-clicking in filesystem panel
Reset page layout by re-positioning each panel using button under Utilities -&amp;gt; Reset Layout
Reset and erase all page memory using button under&amp;#160;Utilities -&amp;gt;&amp;#160;Hard Reset Page
Clear and invert buttons in the bitmap builder
Import exported lines to bitmap builder by selecting bitmap array and comment then left-clicking
Download most compatible/tested Thumby MicroPython firmware through Utilities&amp;#160;-&amp;gt; Download Firmware button and follow instructions provided when hovering over &amp;#39;Download Firmware&amp;#39; button
