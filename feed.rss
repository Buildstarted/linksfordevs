      <link>https://jimmybogard.com/avoid-in-memory-databases-for-tests/</link>
      <description>A controversial GitHub issue came to my attention a couple of weeks ago around ditching the in-memory provider for Entity Framework Core. This seemed like a no-brainer to me - these database providers are far from trivial to maintain, even for in-memory strategies. It's something our teams learned nearly a</description>

      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope.html</link>
      <description>Since the first browser war between Netscape and Internet Explorer, web browsers have been using features as their primary means of competing with each other. This strategy of unlimited scope and perpetual feature creep is reckless, and has been allowed to go on for far too long.</description>

      <description>JetBrains Rider, The cross-platform .NET IDE from JetBrains, has been my defacto .NET development environment for over a year now (maybe even two). Having the same tool across macOS and Windows environments is a joy, and with every iteration, the team at JetBrains puts out, the product gets better. I want to show you a feature I recently discovered working on my Hypermedia Lite post (I suggest you check it out if you’re an ASP.NET Core developer).</description>

      <title>How Prince of Persia Defeated Apple II's Memory Limitations | War Stories | Ars Technica</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw0VfmXKq54</link>
      <description>For today’s episode of War Stories, Ars Technica sat down with Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner to learn about the challenges he faced while bringing his ambitious vision for the game to life. As the 1980's wound down, Mechner found himself fighting against not only the limitations of the Apple II hardware but the impending death of the platform itself. Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.

      <title>The Philosophy of Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/</link>
      <description>The philosophy of computer science is concerned with those
ontological, methodological, and ethical issues that arise from within
the academic discipline of computer science as well as from the
practice of software development. Thus, the philosophy of computer
science shares the same philosophical goals as the philosophy of
mathematics and the many subfields of the philosophy of science, such
as the philosophy of biology or the philosophy of the social sciences.
The philosophy of computer science also considers the analysis of
computational artifacts, that is, human-made
computing systems, and it focuses on methods involved in the design,
specification, programming, verification, implementation, and testing
of those systems. The abstract nature of computer programs and the
resulting complexity of implemented artifacts, coupled with the
technological ambitions of computer science, ensures that many of the
conceptual questions of the philosophy of computer science have
analogues in the
 philosophy of mathematics,
 the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the
 philosophy of technology.
 Other issues characterize the philosophy of computer science only. We
shall concentrate on three tightly related groups of topics that form
the spine of the subject. First we discuss topics related to the
ontological analysis of computational artifacts, in Sections 1–5
below. Second, we discuss topics involved in the methodology and
epistemology of software development, in Sections 6–9 below.
Third, we discuss ethical issues arising from computer science
practice, in Section 10 below. Applications of computer science are
briefly considered in section 11.</description>
