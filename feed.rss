      <description>Historically, I’ve struggled to find a concise, simple way to explain what it means to practice type-driven design. Too often, when someone asks me “How did you come up with this approach?” I find I can’t give them a satisfying answer. I know it didn’t ju...</description>

      <title>Build your first microservice with .NET - Learn</title>
      <link>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/dotnet-microservices/</link>
      <description>Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other over standard protocols with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently.  Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module will teach you how to build your first microservice with .NET.</description>

      <title>Clojure is frustrating... and it is a good thing</title>
      <link>https://blog.jakubholy.net/2021/clojure-is-frustrating-fortunately/</link>
      <description>n 2016, the Clojure core team announced Clojure Spec, the most important addition to Clojure since v1.0.0. Spec allows you to describe and verify the shape of data (and much more) in a somewhat unique way. Having experienced developing a webshop from scratch in the dynamically typed JavaScript/Node.js, with the code growing in complexity and team in size, I very much appreciated the value of describing and checking data against a schema at important points of the program (without being swamped by doing it everywhere). In 2018 Rich Hickey in his talk Maybe Not discussed some shortcomings of Spec - some of which I have experienced personally - and work on Spec 2 started to address those and some limitations. I was fired up because Spec was great - and Spec 2 seemed to be perfect. I waited, and waited, …​ and waited. It is 2021 and Spec 2 is still nowhere in sight. That is truly frustrating. Similarly it has been with other design developments in Clojure such as named arguments. And it is, despite all my frustration, very, very important that it is this way.</description>

      <title>Signed Anonymous Messages [The Call of the Open Sidewalk]</title>
      <link>https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan%3Asignedanon</link>
      <description>Normally you would send a message encrypted but with no signature when you want to go anonymous with OpenPGP. Sometimes you might want to send a series of anonymous messages tied together with the same identity. That is a bit more work but is quite doable using OpenPGP.</description>
