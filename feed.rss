      <title>Securing self-hosted Plex with Cloudflare Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://mirio.dev/2022/09/15/securing-plex-with-cloudflare-tunnels/</link>
      <description>Introduction Plex.tv Media Server is an application to organize and stream your own personal library of videos, audio and photos. Plex supports sharing your library with others on your local network. Plex even has the ability to share your catalog over the public Internet through a feature called Remote Access.
However, most people should be extremely cautious when deploying anything that is accessible over the public Internet. Bots and hackers are continuously scanning IP addresses and well known ports for any opportunity to exploit services using default usernames and password or take advantage of CVE’s on out-of-date services to install malware on your devices.</description>
