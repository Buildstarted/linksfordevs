      <description>The new Mastodon release brings you a much better audio player and improved support for different audio and video formats, as well as some additional security mechanisms.The audio player has been completely reworked to have a more eye-catching design. It will extract album art from the uploaded audio file automatically, or allow you to upload a thumbnail of your own choosing to be displayed in the center. Dominant colors from the artwork or thumbnail will then be used to give the player a unique look.</description>

      <title>How it works - Briar</title>
      <link>https://briarproject.org/how-it-works/</link>
      <description>Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn’t rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users’ devices. If the internet’s down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. If the internet’s up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.</description>

Info for Nerds: 
This game was coded in C, not a very modern language for game design, but very much worth learning. The syntax allows you to carry over the skill to any language such as C# or C++ if you want to do gamedev, but its lack of add-ons makes it the perfect choice for low level hardware unlike Python.We did not have to rely on ANY game engines, but we used libraries made for the calculator. 

I learned a lot from Tutorialspoint, but if you’re interested in seeing the actual source code for my C games, I post most of it on my website and my GitHub.
