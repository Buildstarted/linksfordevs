      <title>Potentials of Multitenancy Fine-Tuned LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://le.qun.ch/en/blog/2023/09/11/multi-lora-potentials/</link>
      <description>As open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and permissive, more and more users are incorporating LLMs into their projects. An essential adaptation step is the integration of domain-specific documents into the pre-trained model, known as fine-tuning. Often, the additional knowledge from domain-specific documents is minuscule compared to what the pre-trained model already knows. In such scenarios, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique proves valuable. With LoRA, a fine-tuned model adds fewer than 0.1% of parameters to the pre-trained model. In concrete terms, this means a LoRA fine-tuned model increases storage by only 10~200 MB, depending on the configuration. From a computational standpoint, given the marginal increase in parameters compared to the pre-trained model, the additional computational load is relatively small. Considering the minimal storage addition and computational overhead, I believe there’s potential in developing a multitenancy fine-tuned LLM serving service. This service could host thousands of LoRA models, all sharing the same backbone LLM. With batching, each user request would invoke a distinct fine-tuned model, thereby amortizing storage and computational costs across various models. In my previous blog post, I delved into the batching effects in LLM serving. In this post, I’ll detail why multitenancy LoRA serving has immense potential.</description>

      <description>The ego never dies. At least, when you are still alive.

      <title>Software engineer titles - let&amp;#39;s get rid of them (??)</title>
      <link>https://workdad.dev/posts/software-eng-titles/</link>
      <description>One of the worst ideas that I’ve seen in tech companies is to strip away titles from software engineers and just call them that. Levels are obviously preserved1, because you still need to be able to compensate according to them but they are internal and not supposed to be divulged.
The justifications I’ve seen for this have been along the lines of
Some people feel intimidated by a person’s title, particularly if the gap is big (say, junior and staff); It puts everyone in the same bucket, erasing differences and giving everyone a “we are all just software engineers, let’s work together” vibe; It allows everyone to be able to step up and own any engineering problem because, again, “we are all just software engineers here”; I’ve also heard of something-something solves under-slotting of minorities (seriously, can’t remember the reason exactly because it was just too wrong).</description>
