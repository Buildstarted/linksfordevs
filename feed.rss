      <title>Up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly Â· V8</title>
      <link>https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory</link>
      <description>Thanks to recent work in Chrome and Emscripten, you can now use up to 4GB of memory in WebAssembly applications. Thatâ€™s up from the previous limit of 2GB. It might seem odd that there was ever a limit - after all, no work was needed to allow people to use 512MB or 1GB of memory! - but it turns out that there are some special things happening in the jump from 2GB to 4GB, both in the browser and in the toolchain, which weâ€™ll describe in this post.</description>

      <title>A Quick Look at Impredicativity (Simon Peyton Jones)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuNMo136QqI</link>
      <description>Type inference for parametric polymorphism is wildly successful, but has always suffered from an embarrassing flaw: polymorphic types are themselves not first class. Iâ€™ve been trying to fix this flaw for over 15 years , but every time I ended up with a system that was unusably complicated.

But now I think we have it! Quick Look is a practical, implemented, and deployable design for impredicative type inference. It is simple to explain (although you can be the judge of that), and crucially it can be implemented with modest, localised changes that are fully compatible with GHCâ€™s myriad other type system extensions.

Bio: Simon Peyton Jones, FRS, graduated from Trinity College Cambridge in 1980. After two years in industry, he spent seven years as a lecturer at University College London, and nine years as a professor at Glasgow University, before moving to Microsoft Research (Cambridge) in 1998.

Simonâ€™s main research interest is in functional programming languages, their implementation, and their application. He was a key contributor to the design of the now-standard functional language Haskell, and is the lead designer of the widely-used Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). He has written two textbooks about the implementation of functional languages. He is particularly motivated by direct application of principled theory to practical language design and implementation â€” that is one reason he loves functional programming so much.

Simon is chair of Computing at School, the grass-roots organisation that was at the epicentre of the 2014 reform of the English computing curriculum.

audience: Anyone interested in statically-typed functional programming.

      <title>How to add custom logging in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://asp.net-hacker.rocks/2017/05/05/add-custom-logging-in-aspnetcore.html</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core is pretty flexible, customizable and extendable. You are able to change almost everything. Even the logging. If you don't like the built-in logging, you are able to plug in your own logger or an existing logger like log4net, NLog, Elmah. In this post I'm going to show you how to add a custom logger.</description>

      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/announcing-uno-platform-2-3-android-10-android-x-and-more/</link>
      <description>Â  The wait is over! Uno.UI for Android now supports compilation for API level 29 (Android 10). It is now possible to use all the new APIs available like the new location permissionsÂ and improvements to the BiometryÂ and foldables support. Â  Using the API level 29 allowed us to review our TextBlock implementation for Android and use official APIs now available to replace some reflection code required to access hidden APIs for MaxLines. While being safer going forward, this approach also provides performance gains for this crucial control. Applications have only 1 or 2 TextBlocks right? ðŸ™‚ Exit Android Support Libraries, Welcome Android X Like all Android and Xamarin developers before, we were using the Android Support Libraries. Those packages can sometimes cause developers some headaches but they achieve a pretty awesome feat. Among other things, they allow us to use new features on devices running older Android versions. The Android team started a huge refactor to break those libraries into even smaller pieces, now called Android X (or JetPack) and then the Xamarin team released their stable bindings for them last February. Logically, we had to migrate Uno to them! Shout out to the Xamarin team, their migration tooling worked â€¦</description>
