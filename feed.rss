      <title>Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043</link>
      <description>Because &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; large language models are capable of generating a
great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these
models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been
some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called &amp;quot;jailbreaks&amp;quot; against
LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle
in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method
that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.
Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range
of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the
probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than
refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our
approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of
greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past
automatic prompt generation methods.
  Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach
are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.
Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,
queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as
multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting
attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces
to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,
Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the
state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models,
raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from
producing objectionable information. Code is available at

      <title>Universal and Transferable Attacks on Aligned Language Models</title>
      <link>https://llm-attacks.org/</link>
      <description>Overview of Research : Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude undergo extensive fine-tuning to not produce harmful content in their responses to user questions.  Although several studies have demonstrated so-called &amp;quot;jailbreaks&amp;quot;, special queries that can still induce unintended responses, these require a substantial amount of manual effort to design, and can often easily be patched by LLM providers.</description>

      <link>https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-09-01-FFT/</link>
      <description>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) developed by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 has its origins in the work of Gauss. The FFT, its variants and extensions to finite fields, are a fundamental algorithmic tool and a beautiful example of interplay between algebra and combinatorics.

      <title>Testcontainers - Integration Testing Using Docker In .NET</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/testcontainers-integration-testing-using-docker-in-dotnet</link>
      <description>Modern software applications rarely work in isolation. On the contrary, a typical application will talk to several external systems like databases, messaging systems, cache providers, and many 3rd party services. And it&amp;#39;s up to you to ensure everything functions correctly.
Hopefully, I don&amp;#39;t have to convince you about the value of writing tests.
You should be writing tests. Period.
However, I do want to discuss the value of integration testing.
Unit tests are helpful to test business logic in isolation, without any external services. They are easy to write and provide almost instant feedback.
But you can&amp;#39;t be fully confident in your application without integration tests.
So, in this week&amp;#39;s newsletter, I&amp;#39;ll show you how to use Docker for integration testing.
Here&amp;#39;s what we will use to write integration tests:
- Testcontainers - Docker - xUnit
Let&amp;#39;s dive in!</description>

      <title>Restarting macOS apps automatically on crash - Alin Panaitiu</title>
      <link>https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Restarting-macOS-apps-automatically-on-crash</link>
      <description>Normally apps crash because of bugs introduced by the developer, but in my experience, there are cases where crashes can be out of the developer’s control. For example the app might work with hardware closely, and the expectations the system has on that hardware are not met when a power or connection cord is yanked out (or if there’s any electromagnetic interference caused by your IKEA chair) Or maybe the app works with a network shared disk which disconnects abruptly in the middle of busy I/O, or a rogue driver changes the hardware tree while the app is traversing it, or God forbid, there is a kernel bug. ...</description>

      <description>There is something special about Taiwan I couldn’t really explain the first time I arrived. On my first trip to Taiwan, I couldn’t put words to this positive feeling I had when roaming around the city. It was a mix of relaxation, freedom, safety, friendliness, and convenience, everything all at once. I didn’t do much; I walked randomly in the city, worked in coffee shops, ate in random restaurants. I only stayed a week, but I knew I’d come again for a longer stay.</description>
