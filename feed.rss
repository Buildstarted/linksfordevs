      <description>Background The OData URI parser parses the $filter query to a FilterClause. The FilterBinder translates an OData $filter parse tree represented by a FilterClause to an Expression.

      <link>https://janikvonrotz.ch/2022/03/29/maintain-attention/</link>
      <description>A subtle but profound change has happened during the last years. Our most valuable commodity has been captivated and exploited. Can you guess what it is? I’m talking about attention. Yes, the very ability to focus on something has been taken from many of us. In this post I try to elaborate my thoughts and hopefully establish a dialog on this issue.</description>

      <title>Azure DevOps Podcast: Chris Tacke on .NET 6 IoT on Linux - Episode 184</title>
      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/chris-tacke-on-net-6-iot-on-linux-episode-184</link>
      <description>Chris Tacke is an industry leader in managed application development for industrial process control, medical, telematics, and just about any other embedded industry. Chris specializes in Windows CE and the .NET Compact Framework, and mobile and embedded device application development. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [2:22] Fun fact! Chris got a degree in Geology long ago, and his first job was doing seismic work and hand-analyzing a lot of data. Chris talks about his first foray into programming, a job in Excel, writing VBA macros to analyze the data. [4:08] Chris walks us through a job at Microsoft by way of a horse race in Virginia during the .com boom. After the .com crash, he worked at a company that made single board computers and moved to be an engineering manager for the Windows CE department. He was independent for 20+ years before joining , and then  came onto his radar. [6:42] Chris is the owner of the Meadow Core pieces and does a fair bit of the driver development. [8:49] How does the Jetson Nano compare to Raspberry Pi? [13:47] Chris talks about the first goal to run on modern.net. [16:41] What is the vision now to say that we need to do this on Linux? [21:33] Is this the same vision as Maui, to run anywhere embedded? [23:38] How does it impact the process of building, test suites, and different test environments? [24:18] Chris talks about Meadow Test Suite, which has the goal to deploy binaries down to a device and find tests that look just like an xUnit test that can then talk to hardware. [30:56] This totally redefines the term of the “full-stack” developer. [31:12] What can people utilize today, and what is the DevOps chain Chris and his team are using? &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
