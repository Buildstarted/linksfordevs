      <title>Foreword — ZK Jargon Decoder</title>
      <link>https://nmohnblatt.github.io/zk-jargon-decoder/foreword.html</link>
      <description>The ZK Jargon Decoder aims to be a dictionary and reference guide for common jargon found in cryptography and the zero-knowledge literature. It is collection of informal and practical definitions. Each term should have a one-liner for quick reference and a more detailed explanation if needed.</description>

      <title>Energy Monitoring with Shelly EM and Home Assistant</title>
      <link>https://www.jamesridgway.co.uk/energy-monitoring-with-shelly-em-and-home-assistant/</link>
      <description>Over the last couple of years, I&amp;#39;ve been putting Shelly devices into my house as part of my home automation journey. Although I&amp;#39;ve mainly used Shelly devices for automating lighting, they produce other devices such as an Energy Monitory (Shelly EM). So, with the recent energy price rises, I figured</description>

      <title>How Minecraft Stores Crafting Recipes</title>
      <link>https://zachmanson.com/blog/crafting-recipes/</link>
      <description>As of Minecraft version 1.18.1, there are 739 crafting
        recipes in the game…depending on how you count. This little
        rabbithole is something I fell into during a meeting for a group
        project this week. The project tasks us with building a “daily
        puzzle game” in vein of Wordle, as my web development unit likes
        the idea of looking anacronistic in a few years.</description>

      <title>The Web PKI 2.0</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/561/the-web-pki-20/</link>
      <description>The Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is what&amp;#39;s behind the green lock in your browser&amp;#39;s URL bar. Actually, as I&amp;#39;m writing this, I realize that it&amp;#39;s not even green anymore:

Now, instead of having a green lock that stands out, you get a &amp;quot;Not Secure&amp;quot; that stands out if you visit a non-HTTPS (or plain HTTP) website:

In this post I will briefly explain what this lock means, what the foundations for ...</description>

      <title>The Strange World of NPM Site Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://mikevdv.dev/blog/2022-05-29-the-strange-world-of-npm-site-alternatives</link>
      <description>Like many web developers, I work day to day within the javasript ecosystem. For those who aren&amp;#39;t aware, NPM is the primary package manager for javascript developers. While in the early days, it was primarly for NodeJS and backend use (with Bower acting as the frontend equivalent), it is now used consistantly across the stack. I use NPM at least 100 times a day; Not just for installing and managing packages but for managing scripts, git hooks and test suites. npm run dev, npm run test and npm run test:changes are all so frequently typed that I can access them in my terminal consistently within 2-3 presses of the up key.</description>

      <title>Growing into Platform Engineering</title>
      <link>https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/growing-into-platform-engineering/</link>
      <description>This talk shares my experience leading an SRE team, scaling from three people running all of the company’s infrastructure to a product-centric Platform Engineering team building tools for 200 other engineers. I’ll explain the challenges we faced at each stage – problems that are common across engineering orgs – and the pragmatic steps we took to solve them, helping us get value before going all-in on an Internal Developer Platform.</description>
