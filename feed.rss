      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210426-00/?p=105153</link>
      <description>Suppose you want a coroutine that terminates on unhandled exceptions, or equivalently (looking at it from the consumer side) a coroutine that never throws an exception when awaited. For regular functions, the way to say this is to put the noexcept exception specification on your function declaration: int GetValue() noexcept {   return LoadValue();</description>

      <title>How to send an email with dynamic templates from SendGrid with ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/how-to-send-email-with-dynamic-templates-from-sendgrid/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about sending emails with dynamic templates from SendGrid with ASP.NET Core. SendGrid will help you to configure and send emails from your apps using SMTP API and SendGrid API. SendGrid also helps you to design and configure email templates from their admin portal. In one of applications I am building I am using Azure B2C - which currently supports custom from email address with the help of SendGrid. You can find more details about how to configure it from here. So first you need to create dynamic template from SendGrid. You can create it from https://mc.sendgrid.com/dynamic-templates. You can create the template either using Code Editor or Design Editor.</description>

      <title>I CAN MAKE THIS WORK</title>
      <link>https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/04/24/service-now-api-and-typescript-conditional-types/</link>
      <description>The Service Now REST API is an API which allows you to interact with Service Now. It produces different shaped results based upon the sysparmdisplayvalue query parameter. This post looks at how we can model these API results with TypeScripts conditional types. The aim being to minimise repetition whilst remaining strongly typed. This post is specifically about the Service Now API, but the principles around conditional type usage are generally applicable.</description>

      <description>This week’s post is pretty short. I’ve already written about overengineering, but this adds a personal touch. I had to rewrite my Jet Train demo to use another data provider, switching from a Swiss one to a Bay Area one. One of the main components of the demo is a streaming pipeline. The pipeline: Reads data from a web endpointTransforms data through several stepsWrites the final data into an in-memory data grid Most of the transform steps in #2 enrich the data.

      <title>Rage bug reporting : ezyang’s blog</title>
      <link>http://blog.ezyang.com/2021/04/rage-bug-reporting/</link>
      <description>At Facebook, we have an internal convention for tooling called &amp;quot;rage&amp;quot;. When something goes wrong and you want to report a bug, the tool developer will typically ask you to give them a rage. For a command line tool, this can be done by running a rage subcommand, which will ask about which previous CLI invocation you&amp;#39;d like to report, and then giving you a bundle of logs to send to the developer.</description>
