      <title>Index Types in PostgreSQL: Learning PostgreSQL with Grant - Simple Talk</title>
      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/postgresql/index-types-in-postgresql-learning-postgresql-with-grant/</link>
      <description>As with any other relational data management system (RDBMS), PostgreSQL uses indexes as a mechanism to improve data access. PostgreSQL has a number of different index types, supporting different behaviors and different types of data. In addition, again, similar to other RDBMS, there are properties and behaviors associated with these indexes.  In this article I’m going to go over the different types of indexes and some index behaviors. We’ll get into what the indexes are, how they work, and how best you can apply them within your databases. I’m hoping you’ll develop an understanding of which indexes are likely to work better in each situation.</description>

      <title>Microservices are a Big Ball of Mud</title>
      <link>https://code-held.com/2022/07/28/microservices/</link>
      <description>Over the past years I attended hundreds of interviews. Many candidates proudly told tales on how they develop their projects with a microservice architecture. Often (I don’t want to say “always”, but from my memory I think it actually is “always”) it does not require many questions to see that they used a rocket launcher to kill a mouse. Microservices are hard. Everyone who experienced the pain of operating such an architecture can relate to it. The complexity kills you at one point or the other. You already had to do multiple refactorings of your architecture - because your domains didn’t work out. I wonder - why is this architecture so appealing to developers? And then I remember what I found them appealing 10 years ago.</description>

      <description>Cloudflare R2 is a new object storage that has been launched in 2022. It offers S3-compatible storage with built-in CDN. The pricing is much simpler and affordable compared to the combination of AWS S3 + Cloudfront which are commonly used for the same goal. Another benefit is that you don’t have to pay for data transfer between AWS regions.</description>

      <title>Is it worth encrypting? | Matthew Linkous</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewlinkous.com/p/encryption-worthy</link>
      <description>Today, nearly all of our data is backed up to the cloud. Often times our only copy of our important information will live on some far away server outside of our control. This comes with clear privacy risks. If our data is on someone else’s machine, in their hands, they are free to peek into that data without us consenting or even knowing. It’s even the business model of many of the biggest companies in the world to read private data to better target advertisements. This is a problem that is often met with a simple solution: encrypt your data.</description>

      <title>Implementing Authentication in Azure Static Web Apps - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/implementing-authentication-in-static-web-apps-part1/</link>
      <description>This post is about implementing authentication in Azure Static Web Apps. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository. Similar to Azure App Service, Azure Static Web App offers authentication out of the box. The service offers five authentication providers - Azure AD, Twitter, GitHub, Google, and Facebook, out of the five, two of them, Google and Facebook are in preview mode. In this post we will explore the Static web app running on Free Plan. For Standard plan we need to configure the social provider client Id, client secret and callback URIs. For Free plan there is no configuration required.</description>

      <title>Executing async operations onchange in Blazor</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/365/executing-async-operations-onchange-in-blazor</link>
      <description>Blazor&amp;#39;s two-way databinding model is extremely powerful, but sometimes 
		it can get in the way of what you want to do. For example, you might 
		want to execute an asynchronous operation such as remote validation when a value changes in a 
		textbox. Perhaps you want to check instantaneously that the value - a username maybe - 
		doesn&amp;#39;t already exist in a database before you accept a new 
		registration. You cannot add an onchange event handler if 
		you already have a value bound to the element, so what can you do? In this 
		article, I look at solutions for both HTML elements and EditForm input 
		validation components up to an including .NET 7, and a new 
		feature released in .NET 7.0.1.</description>
