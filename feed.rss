      <title>The Right Way To Use HttpClient In .NET</title>
      <link>https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/the-right-way-to-use-httpclient-in-dotnet</link>
      <description> If you&amp;#39;re building a .NET application, chances are high that you&amp;#39;ll need to call an external API over HTTP.
The easy way to make HTTP requests in .NET is to use the HttpClient to send those requests. And it&amp;#39;s a great abstraction to work with, especially with the methods supporting JSON payloads and responses.
Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s easy to misuse the HttpClient.
Port exhaustion and DNS behavior are some of the most common problems.
So here&amp;#39;s what you need to know about work with HttpClient: - How not to use HttpClient - How to simplify configuration with IHttpClientFactory - How to configure typed clients - Why you should avoid typed clients in singleton services - When to use which option

      <description>A good onboarding experience will get the new-joiner up and running quickly.
A great onboarding experience will stay with them forever.
A terrible onboarding experience will leave a horrible taste in their mouth about their new company on their first day.
They will lose confidence in themselves and the people around them.
The onboarding experience is a litmus test for how seriously a company supports their people.</description>

      <description>Lissajous curves, named after the French mathematician Jules Antoine Lissajous, are mathematical visualizations that represent the motion of two perpendicular harmonic oscillations. These curves are formed by plotting the coordinates of points that correspond to the simultaneous values of the two oscillating variables.</description>

      <title>My experience of the Chrome Extension submission process</title>
      <link>https://meetingdolphin.com/blog/chrome-extension-submission</link>
      <description>I started building the Meeting Dolphin Chrome Extension back in April and initially, the submission process was really quite intimidating. Similar to a visa application process (which I have completed many in my lifetime), it’s quite the black box with little to no information on how the review is done, when the review is finished and what happens if it’s rejected.</description>
