      <title>How do I protect myself against a COM call that can hang? I&amp;#39;m already running the server out-of-process. | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210122-00/?p=104750</link>
      <description>Say you invoke a cross-process COM method, and then you decide to cancel it, say, because it’s taking too long. What you definitely don’t want to do is call Terminate&amp;#173;Thread. That way lies madness. What you can do is enable call cancellation by calling Co&amp;#173;Enable&amp;#173;Call&amp;#173;Cancellation,</description>

      <description>DDoS attack trends in the final quarter of 2020 defied norms in many ways. For the first time in 2020, Cloudflare observed an increase in the number of large DDoS attacks. Specifically, the number of attacks over 500Mbps and 50K pps saw a massive uptick.</description>

      <description>Hello web developers!  Responsive design has always been the cornerstone of web development, rather than designing for a single use case, we focus on creating applications that can adjust to the needs of the platform they are running on. Microsoft Surface Duo is no exception to this and in past blog posts we’ve explored how we can use the CSS and JavaScript primitives to create experiences using standard web technologies.</description>

      <title>.NET GC Internals mini-series – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/net-gc-internals-mini-series/</link>
      <description>I’ve decided to make a series of at least 8 free weekly-based webinars about in-depth implementation details of the .NET GC and… I’m super happy with it! Why the idea? Many my other activities are about more practical “.NET memory management”, like my book or workshops/trainings/consultancy I gave. But during all this practical-oriented events there is always not enough time to explain in details how .NET GC is implemented. Obviously, I always explain some concepts and algorithms, to the level that helps in understanding the whole concept. But not with the level of details that I am satisfied.</description>

      <description>The other day I had a friend come to my place with the request to “learn HTML and how web sites work”. We spent a few hours playing with the topic and she got excited and quite far into it. The whole thing reminded me about a real problem when it comes to teaching people HTML. We keep fast-tracking the learning to the fun part of building visual things with it.</description>

      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers.html</link>
      <description>Let’s Encrypt helps to protect a huge portion of the Web by providing TLS certificates to more than 235 million websites. A database is at the heart of how Let’s Encrypt manages certificate issuance. If this database isn’t performing well enough, it can cause API errors and timeouts for our subscribers. Database performance is the single most critical factor in our ability to scale while meeting service level objectives. In late 2020, we upgraded our database servers and we’ve been very happy with the results.</description>

      <title>Scott Finlay - The Agile Development of a Novel</title>
      <link>https://www.scottfinlayauthor.com/articles/the-agile-development-of-a-novel</link>
      <description>Everyone has read a novel and used software, but how many people really know how they&amp;#39;re produced? It may surprise many (also within the two disciplines) to learn that the process of writing a book and that of writing software have quite a lot of similarities. The similarities are so profound, in fact, that tools and techniques used within one practice can be adapted and applied to the other to improve the process.</description>

      <link>https://yoavy.com/startup-franchises/</link>
      <description>The world’s biggest fast food chains don’t make money selling food – they make money selling subscriptions. 93% of McDonald’s restaurants are franchises, where the restaurant is owned by McDonald’s and rented out to a franchisee who operates it. This model ensures McDonald’s a steady revenue stream independent of changing seasons or sensibilities, while also helping them cut operating costs. It’s a great business model.</description>

      <description>Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 5 years, chances are you have used an Electron-based application at least once in your life. For those (probably few) who don’t know what Electron is, it’s a cross-platform desktop app framework built on top of Chromium and NodeJS (which in turn is based on Chrome’s V8 engine). This Chrome-ception allows developers to build complete desktop applications using web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JS, and the ~500 MB of node_modules we all know and love.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I played in the Women Unite Over CTF, hosted by WomenHackerz and several other organizations.&amp;#160;There was a fantastic turnout, with 1,000 women playing!&amp;#160;For many of the participants, it was their first time playing a CTF.
After the event was over, there was some discussion on what to do if you wanted to play more CTFs, if you got stumped a lot, etc.&amp;#160;This is intended to be a guide for beginners who have just started playing CTFs (or for people who have never played, but would like to).</description>

      <title>Regarding CSW and the Bitcoin Whitepaper</title>
      <link>https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/regarding-csw</link>
      <description>Yesterday both Bitcoin.org and Bitcoincore.org received allegations of copyright infringement of the Bitcoin whitepaper by lawyers 
representing Craig Steven Wright. In this letter, they claim Craig owns the copyright to the paper, the Bitcoin name, and 
ownership of bitcoin.org. They also claim he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, and the original owner 
of bitcoin.org. Bitcoin.org and Bitcoincore.org were both asked to take down the whitepaper. We believe these claims are without merit, and refuse 
to do so.</description>
