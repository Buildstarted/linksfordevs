      <title>CSAW Quals 2021 Bits</title>
      <link>https://blog.cryptohack.org/csaw-quals-2021</link>
      <description>CryptoHack was asked to make some challenges for CSAW 2021 and Bits was our submission for the qualifiers, written by Robin and Jack. For those who qualified for the finals, you’ll have the chance to solve a few more CryptoHack challenges, but for now, we wanted to go through Bits, explain some potential solutions and some cover a few interesting things we learnt when building the challenge itself.</description>

      <description>The shifting sands of tech IPOs If the IPO process is like a debutante ball, the top investment banks are akin to a finishing school. They help gussy up companies, teach them proper manners like how to do GAAP accounting, and bring them around to call on prospective investors and eventually debut to society.

      <title>Introduction — pyNomo Documentation 0.3.2.0 documentation</title>
      <link>http://lefakkomies.github.io/pynomo-doc/introduction/introduction.html</link>
      <description>A nomogram or nomograph is a diagram that provides an easy, graphical way of calculating the result of a mathematical formula. Sometimes also called an alignment chart, a nomogram consists of a set of numbered scales, usually one for each variable in the formula, arranged so that a straightedge can be placed across known values to find the unknown value that solves the formula. Since an equation in two variables is usually represented by a graph, most nomograms represent formulas that involve three or more variables.</description>

      <link>https://kerkour.com/blog/fight-climate-change-as-a-technologist/</link>
      <description>“Quitting smoking is too hard, I will never succeed”. You may already have heard this kind of affirmation from someone who doesn’t have the courage to stop tobacco. Of course they will quit smoking, on the latest the day of their life in the worst case. And, unfortunately, the more they wait to voluntarily stop smoking, the more it increases the chances to experience a way more unpleasant, involuntary stop.</description>

      <title>Christians in Game Dev / Journalism</title>
      <link>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH6WT5RiJ6_Ovj3qWd1TvsM5bx4ZNjyVw-sP9w8uqF_V6R1A/viewform</link>
      <description>The information you put in here will be kept completely confidential. I may contact you in the future if there is sufficient interest in starting a more intentional community (think: mailing list / email pair-ups / Discord / Slack / whatever the kids are doing these days), but only ever with your permission. Otherwise, this will never become public, nor will your individual responses be seen by anyone who is not me. (With the standard disclaimer that if you say you&amp;#39;re going to hurt yourself or someone else I can&amp;#39;t keep that secret. I don&amp;#39;t think any of the questions here will lead you that way, but my training as a mandated reporter means I instinctively add this caveat.)

Who am I, then, that you should trust me? I&amp;#39;m Shane Liesegang (https://shaneliesegang.com, https://twitter.com/OptimistPanda). I worked in games and adjacent fields for 10+ years (Walt Disney Imagineering, EA [LMNO if that means anything to you], Bethesda [Skyrim, a bit of the Fallouts], Sony [God of War]), but in 2015 I entered the Jesuits on my way to being a Catholic priest. At the moment I&amp;#39;m doing refugee aid work in the Middle East. (Whether you trust me based on any of that is up to you.)

I still love games and care about people who make them and write about them. (Sometimes I even still make / work on games!) Lately I&amp;#39;ve had a few folks reach out to me asking about other Christians in the gamedev world, and sadly, beyond a couple of people, I mostly have just rumors and guesses. I know of and am a part of a few communities that have an intersection of creative folks and Christianity, but am curious to know who else is out there.

I know that &amp;quot;Christian&amp;quot; is a wide net, especially these days. But if you are or have ever thought of yourself as Christian and you are someone who spends their days working on or thinking about games, I&amp;#39;m curious to hear about you.</description>

      <description>Last time, we looked at the easy case of the Create&amp;#173;Stream&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;HGlobal function, where you just hand an HGLOBAL to the stream and wipe your hands of it. The weird case is where you pass fDelete&amp;#173;On&amp;#173;Release = FALSE. For now, let’s look at the case where you pass a null HGLOBAL,</description>

      <description>Go is regularly criticized for odd decisions and idiosyncrasies, while Rust is celebrated as an almost perfectly designed alternative that solves Go&amp;#39;s problems. But in fact, Go and Rust are far from interchangeable.</description>

      <title>How to visualize decision tree</title>
      <link>https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html</link>
      <description>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of gradient boosting machines and Random Forests(tm), probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data. Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models. Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn&amp;#39;t find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. So, we&amp;#39;ve created a general package (part of the animl library) for scikit-learn decision tree visualization and model interpretation.</description>

      <description>FARGO, N. D. (WDAY/CNN Newsource/WKRC) - This story is nuts -- literally. A man in North Dakota has been saddled with a massive cleanup job, caused by a tiny, furry perpetrator.  (WDAY, BILL FISCHER, CNN / CNN NEWSOURCE) &amp;quot;The red squirrel will come behind, run along the frame rail and all the way up to the front,&amp;quot; said Bill Fischer. Fischer just cannot win the war. A beautiful black walnut tree in the yard produces nuts that a red squirrel finds irresistible.</description>

      <title>About Offline First &amp;#183; RxDB</title>
      <link>https://rxdb.info/offline-first.html</link>
      <description>Offline-First is a software paradigm where the software must work as well offline as it does online.
To implement this, you have to store data at the client side, so that your application can still access it when the internet goes away.
This can be either done with complex caching strategies, or by using an offline first database (like RxDB) that stores the data inside of IndexedDb and replicates it from and to the backend in the background. This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.</description>

      <description>OK, this is a post I’ve been planning for months, I think? Several past drafts have been injured and killed before I gave birth to this one, the succesful one. So, let’s jump straight into it: I wanna talk about GNU.
GNU. Not the FSF, not RMS… Why are all these three letter acronyms? Are all of these cover operations of some three letter agency? I hope saying that doesn’t get me into any trouble, so you better read my post before I suddenly disappear… Just kidding!</description>
