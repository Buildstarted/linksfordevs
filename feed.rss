      <description>WebSockets are the most used technology for real-time web apps. However, Server Sent Events (SSE) are a simpler alternative that is often superior.

      <description>I saw a tweet from @James_M_South, creator of the amazing ImageSharp library where he mentioned there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of public chatter about said library. Now, I know nothing about image processing or graphics. But, I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to learn more about creating Algorithmic Art, or Generative Art, for a while. And, James&amp;#39; tweet inspired me to dive in.</description>

      <title>Staking</title>
      <link>https://gazzini.com/projects/posts/stake/</link>
      <description>Last year, I raised $100k from friends to run fully-staked validator nodes on 3 different blockchains. We made $300k and learned a lot. Here’s the stuff I found interesting:
Inconsistent Rewards These networks weren’t designed explicitly to infuriate little node operators, but it can seem that way. This is a general problem with proof-of-stake blockchains:
 They incentivize computers to do useful things Because distributed state is hard, they pseudo-randomly elect a little group of computers at any given time to actually do the useful thing Therefore, the computers spend very little time doing the useful thing, so the earnings are sporadic  Every proof-of-stake system has this randomness in the earnings.</description>

      <description>The Busy Beaver question asks: what is the longest that a Turing machine program of n states and k colors can run when started on the blank tape before halting? The function that maps from (n, k) to the longest run length is uncomputable and grows faster than any computable function.</description>

      <description>Time tracking has a bad reputation, it invokes images of managers watching over your shoulder or pay being docked as you punched in minutes before your shift ended. Due to these, and many more, if you suggest to someone to start tracking their time they’re likely to look at you like you’ve gone mad.

      <title>A nice story about Unix processes &amp;quot;infecting&amp;quot; each other</title>
      <link>http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2022/02/09/nice/</link>
      <description>I once worked at a place that had an interesting little problem stemming 
from the way they managed machines and some of the fun side-effects 
processes can have on each other.  This is back in the pre-systemd days 
of running services, such that things tended to be started or restarted 
by someone or something that itself ran as root.  That is, if you 
started something, it might inherit one or more things from your 
environment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual 
environment, it might bestow those &amp;quot;gifts&amp;quot; onto anything it happened to 
touch.</description>
