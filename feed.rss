      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=d8tRM8RJ52M</link>
      <description>David Fowler went from an intern to a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. That’s 11 different promotions all at the same company. I asked him about everything he learned by going through that process. We cover his full career story and go over general advice he has for software engineers. I was also curious to ask him about Microsoft culture and big company tips he has since he's been there for over 17 years.

      <description>Amid the chaos of revolutionary France, one man’s mathematical obsession gave way to a calculation that now underpins much of mathematics and physics. The calculation, called the Fourier transform, decomposes any function into its parts.</description>

      <description>Fil-C uses a parallel concurrent on-the-fly grey-stack Dijkstra accurate non-moving garbage collector called FUGC (Fil's Unbelievable Garbage Collector). You can find the source code for the collector itself in fugc.c, though be warned, that code cannot possibly work without lots of support logic in the rest of the runtime and in the compiler.</description>
