      <title>Mobius – .NET runtime running on .NET Core – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/mobius-net-runtime-running-on-net-core/</link>
      <description>.NET application is “just” a piece of CIL bytecode to be executed by the .NET runtime. And .NET runtime is “just” a program that is able to perform this task. It happens that currently .NET Framework/.NET Core runtimes are written in C++. I am also fully aware of CoreRT that was .NET runtime with many parts rewritten to C# (like type system) but still, crucial parts (including JIT compiler and the GC) were left written in C++.</description>
