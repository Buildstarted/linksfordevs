      <title>Ten Reasons for Tech Optimism in 2021</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/11/26/optimism.html</link>
      <description>I have written previously about losing my teenage optimism for technology, and how we struggle to have bold dreams for the future. Many people have articulated theses of this type, most famously Peter Thiel in claiming that we’ve seen great innovation in the world of bits, but not of atoms. However, change is in the air. I believe we are approaching an inflection point of technological change and ambition. In a twist of irony, COVID has done a great deal to push this along.</description>

      <title>Search for the perfect blog post</title>
      <link>https://nayak.io/posts/search-for-the-perfect-blog-post/</link>
      <description>One of the side goals of most developers is to maintain a blog. We spend an entire weekend trying to decide between Hugo or Gatsby and setting it up. Then going through the enormous list of community developed themes to pick one, only to spend an another weekend modifying it to a point where its no longer what it started out to be.
Repeat this formula a couple of times over the years and you have a blog which barely a few posts but has seen more iterations than the star wars franchise.</description>

      <description>The ultralight hiking community is – as you may gather from the name – very
focused on ultralight equipment and minimalism. Turns out that saving a bit of
weight ten times actually adds up to a significant weight savings, making hikes
– especially longer ones of several days or weeks – a lot more comfortable.</description>

      <description>Tired of searching through squished tab icons to find that one tab you are sure is there?

With TabMerger you can simplify this clutter while greatly increasing productivity in a highly organized and customizable fashion!

A single click is all it takes to merge your tabs into a single place, where you can then re-arrange them into appropriate groups, delete extra/unwanted tabs, customize group colors, and so much more.

All tabs that are merged into TabMerger are stored internally for you to use at a later time, even when you close the browser window. Lots of analytics are provided to keep you informed about the state of your tabs.

      <description>I started tokyodev as a side project, and when I first launched it, it never occurred to me that there might be legal repercussions for advertising job postings. However, in Japan, recruiting is a licensed industry, with criminal penalties of up to a year in prison for practicing without a license, and depending on how a job board is run, it may be classified as recruiting.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;#39;s try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I&amp;#39;m mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we&amp;#39;ll be using the option to add
the files uncompressed. That means I don&amp;#39;t have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.</description>

      <title>Empathy is required for democracy</title>
      <link>https://www.arp242.net/empathy.html</link>

which is why most of us aren’t assholes.</description>
