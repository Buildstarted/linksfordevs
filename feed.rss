      <description>Sometimes a client asks me a question and I&amp;#39;m a little stunned by their mental model of the world. A few weeks ago, we were discussing the need for better cybersecurity in their architecture. We spoke about several aspects of security, then they asked an outstanding question. &amp;quot;What should I buy to be secure?&amp;quot; It [...]</description>

      <title>The Unnoticed Plague - ReynardSec</title>
      <link>https://reynardsec.com/en/the-unnoticed-plague/</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about a plague occurring in the world of IT cybersecurity, which, in my opinion, receives too little attention. The title of the article may seem like an oxymoron, but let&amp;#39;s see if that&amp;#39;s really the case. As an incentive, I&amp;#39;ll add that the topic concerns the data processed in the applications you use, including the confidential information of your company and your clients. It&amp;#39;s better if these data don&amp;#39;t leak, right?</description>

      <description>In Pt.1, I explained that kind of growth I was lucky to witness in my first few years at Grafana. In this post, I’d love to highlight my observations on things that worked well for us. There’s a few things in here that we can do as an IC (Individual Contributor),
and a few at the bottom of this list that can be implemented by company leadership. So lets’ get into it.

      <description>The year is 2024. We have language models that can code, shitty AI-generated content everywhere, and still no flying cars. But a problem that should be trivial to solve is surprisingly annoying: why is there no easy way to link the contents of an &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; tag?</description>

      <title>Should you fine tune for JSON output?</title>
      <link>https://freeman.vc/notes/should-you-fine-tune-for-json-output</link>
      <description>JSON Schemas are a great format to structure outputs of LLMs. Their spec gives you wide latitude in specifying expected constraints (length, enum values, nested objects). Coupled with logit masking, schemas allow you to guarantee the format of your output so there&amp;#39;s no fiddling with unexpected values. It turns LLMs into building blocks with a clear API and makes them a lot more modular.</description>

      <title>How I fall asleep February 21, 2024 on Sepi&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://sepi.me/post-8</link>
      <description>For a long time, I had trouble sleeping. I would lie in bed for hours, unable to sleep because my mind would start thinking about upsetting or negative things. These thoughts would make it even harder for me to fall asleep, as bad thoughts seemed stronger and more real than good ones. Whenever I fell into this trap of negative thinking, I found myself stuck in a cycle of trying and failing to sleep, all while dealing with these unpleasant thoughts.</description>

      <title>Planner programming blows my mind</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/</link>
      <description>Picat is a research language intended to combine logic programming, imperative programming, and constraint solving. I originally learned it to help with vacation scheduling but soon discovered its planner module, which is one of the most fascinating programming models I’ve ever seen.
First, a brief explanation of logic programming (LP). In imperative and functional programming, we take inputs and write algorithms that produce outputs. In LP and constraint solving, we instead provide a set of equations and find assignments that satisfy those relationships.</description>

      <title>Reading Raw ASP.NET Request.Body Multiple Times</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Feb/20/Reading-Raw-ASPNET-RequestBody-Multiple-Times</link>
      <description>Some time ago I wrote about accessing raw request body content in ASP.NET Core which ended up being one of the most popular posts on this blog. But I failed to mention one major caveat: By default Request.Body can only be read once. In this post I discuss why frequently when you need raw Request.Body access you actually need to read the body more than once, and you can enable that functionality and deal with the caveats of doing so.</description>
