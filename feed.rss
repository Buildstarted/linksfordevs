      <title>On The Basics of Modeling</title>
      <link>https://blog.chewxy.com/2021/02/17/modeling-basics/</link>
      <description>I had a very interesting chat with a few data science students yesterday. Part of the chat involved the idea of statistical modeling.

      <description>Security researchers play an important role in the industry, though one that doesn’t always receive the support needed. In this post, I am proposing the creation of a new non-profit entity, the International Association of Information Security Research Professionals (IAISRP), as a supporting group to push research forward, and provide the tools and resources to improve the quality of work, and the quality of life for those involved in this vital work.</description>
