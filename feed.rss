      <description>The end of the heroic age of the tech giants does not imply that tech giants are in decline, but confusing the two is natural. Observers and analysts usually talk that way about companies, especially tech companies and the platforms they enable: they grow, mature, then decline (in relevance if</description>

      <title>The Strategic Fat Stockpile | Lorenzo Venneri</title>
      <link>https://lvenneri.com/blog/strategic-fat-stockpile</link>
      <description>The Cold War left the United States with various reserves and stockpiles in the event of war. These include the Strategic National Stockpile for medical equipment, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and various depots for munitions, military equipment, aircraft, infrastructure, lithium and rare earth minerals. Hopefully USA gov is competent enough to also keep non-public depots for critical infrastructure components like nuclear fuel, transformers, copper, etc.</description>

      <title>2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 17 - Blazingly Fast Checksums with SIMD</title>
      <link>https://jtsylve.blog/post/2022/12/23/Blazingly-Fast-Checksums-with-SIMD</link>
      <description>Today’s post will take on a bit of a different style than the previous posts in this series.  Among other things, I spent my day putting off writing the final APFS encryption blog post by pursuing another one of my New Year goals.  Along the way, I wrote a Fletcher64 hashing function that can validate APFS objects at over 31 GiB/s on my 2017 iMac Pro. Rather than fighting my procrastination, I decided it would be better to share my findings. Given that my chosen learning path was directly relevant to APFS, I’m counting this as a valid APFS Advent Challenge post (and you can’t stop me!).  I hope you enjoy this brief detour into the dark arts of cross-platform SIMD programming.

      <title>Setting up WebFinger</title>
      <link>https://anderegg.ca/2022/12/23/2022-setting-up-webfinger</link>
      <description>I set up a Mastodon account over a month ago and have been enjoying my time there. It’s niche, it’s small, and it feels more like the olden days of Twitter — back when social media was less about “engagement”. It’s possible that Mastodon will eventually suffer from the same issues that sucked the joy from Twitter, but its been fun to explore so far.</description>

      <title>Securing and exposing local services with Tailscale and Nginx</title>
      <link>https://blog.viktorpetersson.com/2022/12/23/securing-services-with-tailscale.html</link>
      <description>Securing and encrypting communication on local network devices is a hard problem. Plenty of people tried, including myself in our now sunsetted company WoTT. The root of the problem is a combination of DNS and routing to local IPs, which means you can’t use automated certificate issuers, like Let’s Encrypt. The solution, it seems, comes from an unexpected source: the VPN/Wireuard service provider Tailscale.</description>

      <description>As someone who has spent countless hours staring at a screen (admit it, we

    Well, wonder no more! In this blog post, we&amp;#39;ll take a brief look at the
    inner workings of a monitor, and hopefully come out on the other side with a
    newfound appreciation for the technology that brings us our favorite movies,
    TV shows, and cat videos.</description>

      <description>This is an attempt to capture some work/events I have been involved with over the last few weeks regarding the rssCloud protocol. I hope this will provide some insights into software development and technical communication, and will be of use to others using the rssCloud protocol. I hope it will also demonstrate that it can be difficult to identify/isolate problems between multiple apps/web services/web sites, and that all involved in the discussion should adopt a mindset of “follow the data” and be open to input from others.</description>

      <title>RSS Readers That You Can Self Host</title>
      <link>https://rohanrd.xyz/posts/rss-readers-that-you-can-self-host/</link>
      <description>Self-hosted RSS readers offer users a way to customize their feeds and have more control over their data and privacy. One of the main advantages of using a self-hosted RSS reader is that it allows you to avoid the algorithms that drive many commercial platforms. These algorithms are designed to show you content that they think you’ll be interested in based on your past browsing history and other factors. With a self-hosted RSS reader, you have complete control over what you see in your feed and can customize it to your liking.</description>
