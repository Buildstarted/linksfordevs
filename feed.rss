      <title>Max Hodak - What is relativity, anyway?</title>
      <link>https://maxhodak.com/nonfiction/2020/09/18/relativity.html</link>
      <description>Relativity is one of my favorite topics in physics. Its origins were almost pure logic puzzle science, which in my opinion is one of the most fun and satisfying types of science. Most people have a vague sense of what relativity is ‚Äì the speed of light is finite, and something about time travel? ‚Äì but they don‚Äôt really know what it is, which is too bad because the principles are very simple, and the results are pretty awesome.</description>

      <title>Brittney Braxton - Journaling as a Dev [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzrEDnIye14</link>
      <description>Note: There are initial captions directly in the video until the interpreter begins.

Are you working with impact and purpose? Are you solidly attuned on what you're doing month-to-month with your role? How difficult is it for you to track your accomplishments at work? If any of these questions lead to uncertain answers, then you should learn what it means to journal professionally as a dev. This talk will cover my exploration into journaling and its application to tracking my goals and progress as a software engineer. I will discuss how to set up your journal for any goals and how to score on your performance review!

      <title>SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels</title>
      <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0239252</link>
      <description>Until treatment and vaccine for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes widely available, other methods of reducing infection rates should be explored. This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4‚Äì64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2‚Äì9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with ‚Äúdeficient‚Äù 25(OH)D values (&lt;20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2‚Äì12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with ‚Äúadequate‚Äù values (30‚Äì34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8‚Äì8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ‚â•55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5‚Äì6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983‚Äì0.986; p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.</description>

      <title>What Does Culturally Responsive Teaching Mean in an Online Environment? [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9__M7a8wHM</link>
      <description>Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) is an instructional approach that seeks to ensure academic success while developing students' sense of culture and social-political awareness. CRT allows students to see themselves in the curriculum and assignments provided by the teacher. In the online and traditional classroom, CRT provides opportunities for students to learn how to value their culture. During this time in America, it is especially important for students to have opportunities to express themselves while using online technology.
