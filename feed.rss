      <description>When I think about the most impressive and impactful engineers I&amp;#39;ve worked with the most common trait they share is their ability to learn. It&amp;#39;s not just that they have deep technical knowledge in useful areas, though they often do, it&amp;#39;s that when presented with a problem in a new area they&amp;#39;re able to approach it and gain enough understanding to come up with a good solution.</description>

      <title>I made a multiplayer shooter game in Lisp</title>
      <link>https://ertu.dev/posts/i-made-an-online-shooter-game-in-lisp/</link>
      <description>Developing a multiplayer third-person shooter game as a solo developer is a journey filled with challenges and
rewards. I embarked on this adventure to create Wizard Masters, a web-based multiplayer game where players battle as
mages wielding elemental spells.
Built using Clojure, a Lisp dialect, this project pushed the boundaries of web game
development and my own skills as a programmer. Here’s how it went.
In Wizard Masters, players can choose from six elemental spells—fire, toxic, ice, lightning, and earth—and compete in
two modes: solo and team deathmatch. I published the game on CrazyGames to reach a broader audience. However, its
multiplayer nature demanded a large player base, which was a constant challenge.</description>

      <title>stories i refuse to believe</title>
      <link>https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/stories-i-refuse-to-believe</link>
      <description>The internet is filled with stories that purport to teach us a valuable lesson or something about how the world works, and they’re really important because they really happened. NASA spent millions of dollars designing a space pen, which was really foolish when they could have just used a pencil like the Russians. I think not as many people believe that anymore, but it’s still floating around out there.</description>
