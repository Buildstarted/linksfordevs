      <title>HDR And Tone Mapping Using OpenGL // Intermediate OpenGL Series</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=xGArZnotM8k</link>
      <description>Welcome to the fascinating world of High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Tone Mapping ‚Äî two essential techniques revolutionizing how light and color are rendered in digital media. In this video, we dive into the technical challenge of lighting overflow, where multiple light sources exceed the valid RGB color range, causing washed-out visuals.

üî• See the list of the books that I'm using as background information for my tutorials: https://ogldev.org/books.html. I highly recommend them for learning more about OpenGL and Vulkan.

      <title>App Slop</title>
      <link>https://www.kvncnnlly.com/2025-07-29-app-slop/</link>
      <description>I don‚Äôt want to be too verbose on this topic, but I think the era of app slop is upon us and the reasoning goes something like this:
Vibe coding has real struggles - it works great in some cases, and the barrier to entry is very low However, unique anything is a recipe for hardship Business logic with more than one condition or multiple steps? Good luck! Tired Miyazaki is the ether of the vibe coding universe Thus those that persevere will have a downward pressure to simplify, simplify, simplify A proliferation of standard interactions will take place driven by the desire to survive the vibe shadcn/ui everywhere! Proportionally, creative UI/UX will diminish Everything becomes a suburban hellscape of bland utilitarian functionality Slop continues to take over Written slop is where it began Visual slop came next Now we are at the cusp of app slop This is probably a bit too pessimistic, and I don‚Äôt want to be that guy. I really am an optimist as far as general AI and technological things go. The above is partially a reflection of the darker moments of my vibe coding efforts coupled to having a little fun on guessing what realities may come to be. I have made great strides with vibe coding only to suddenly hit brick walls on some of the most basic novelties. It‚Äôs shocking, challenging, fun and frustrating. But I feel confident that there will be an ongoing pressure to create a miasma of sameness because it works, and people like to make stuff that works!</description>

      <description>I vividly remember a school trip to a Catholic monastery as a kid. The Dominican monk we met could speak 12 languages, had several degrees, did daily chores like working in the garden, and still had time to follow a strict routine of prayers and study. When I asked him how he managed it all, he replied:

‚ÄúWe take care of the schedule, and the schedule takes care of us.‚Äù</description>

      <title>A short statistical reasoning test - Emir's blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2025-08-17-statistical-reasoning/</link>
      <description>Each fraction has to be modelled as a distribution in order take its
uncertainty into account. The binomial distribution is a good choice, such that
k‚àºBinom(n,p) where k is the number of successes, n the number of
trials and p the fraction of successful trials. We are given k and n, but
we are interested in the distribution of p. There are
many specific ways
to produce a confidence interval for p, the lower bound of which can be used
to order the fractions, and so control the risk of over-estimation.</description>

      <link>https://kyrylo.org/software/2025/08/17/im-a-proud-crud-monkey.html</link>
      <description>Web pages aren‚Äôt that different from what they were in the late ‚Äô90s, early 2000s. They‚Äôre still just forms. They still just write to databases. A lot of people, I think, are very uncomfortable with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys. They just make systems that create, read, update, or delete rows in a database and they have to compensate for that existential dread by over complicating things. ‚Äî DHH, Lex Fridman Podcast #474 (2025)</description>

      <title>The trap of tech that‚Äôs great in the small but not in the large</title>

      <description>There are software technologies that work really well in-the-small, but they don‚Äôt scale up well. The challenge here is that the problem size grows incrementally, and migrating off of them re‚Ä¶</description>

      <title>Well, it seems you just don't like programming</title>
      <link>https://ciesie.com/post/coding_with_ai/</link>
      <description>I already tried to write a blog post about AI. An article, discussing AI generated art, still
festers in my drafts folder. As someone who enjoys 3D modelling, drawing, animating, someone
who believes in art lifting our spirits, I find it pointless and distasteful. Not much to
discuss.
Here are some loose thoughts about AI, mostly from software development perspective, but not
unique to it.
I see coding as both a skill, which enables me to build things I want to build, and an
intellectual exercise. Like any other discipline, it doesn‚Äôt have sharp borders. If you‚Äôre
receptive, if you pay attention, you‚Äôll learn things that apply outside of computer science.
Underlying principles behind coding tell a bigger story, about systems, math, logic, or
effective communication of ideas. Diving deeper into these ideas can become a source of
great, personal satisfaction.</description>
