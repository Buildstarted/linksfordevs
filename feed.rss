      <title>How User Tracking Devalues Ads</title>
      <link>http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2020/12/24/how_user_tracking_devalues_ads/</link>
      <description>Facebook recently took out full-page ads in the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal attacking the way Apple protects its users’ privacy. In the ad, they make the point that Apple harms Facebook’s ability to track people who see Facebook’s ads, and run personalized ads, which, according to Facebook, harms the effectiveness and thus the value of these ads.</description>

      <title>Domain Hunting - Nico Hormaz&amp;#225;bal</title>
      <link>https://nico2sh.com/posts/domain-hunting/</link>
      <description>I’ve been trying to move away from Google’s services for a while. I’m not going to list all the reasons why anyone should do this, people have explained this way better than me already, but in short, because you shouldn’t keep all your eggs in one basket, or in other words because if one day for some reason Google suspends your account, you may loose a significant part of your digital life. This is one reason, but there are many others and a ton of alternatives that will help you in this journey of degoogling yourself. But I’m not writing about this process itself, but because during that process I found myself with another issue which involved a pretty important decision, a decision that I feel it wasn’t the best one: The domain I chose to move for my own site and for serving my self hosted services.</description>

      <title>Neurobiological foundations of neurologic music therapy: rhythmic entrainment and the motor system</title>
      <link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01185/full</link>
      <description>Entrainment is defined by a temporal locking process in which one system’s motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. This process is a universal phenomenon that can be observed in physical (e.g., pendulum clocks) and biological systems (e.g., fire flies). However, entrainment can also be observed between human sensory and motor systems. The function of rhythmic entrainment in rehabilitative training and learning was established for the first time by Thaut and colleagues in several research studies in the early 1990s. It was shown that the inherent periodicity of auditory rhythmic patterns could entrain movement patterns in patients with movement disorders (see for a review: Thaut et al., 1999). Physiological, kinematic, and behavioral movement analysis showed very quickly that entrainment cues not only changed the timing of movement but also improved spatial and force parameters. Mathematical models have shown that anticipatory rhythmic templates as critical time constraints can result in the complete specification of the dynamics of a movement over the entire movement cycle, thereby optimizing motor planning and execution. Furthermore, temporal rhythmic entrainment has been successfully extended into applications in cognitive rehabilitation and speech and language rehabilitation, and thus become one of the major neurological mechanisms linking music and rhythm to brain rehabilitation. These findings provided a scientific basis for the developmen...</description>
