      <title>17-313: Foundations of Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://cmu-313.github.io/</link>
      <description>Successful software projects require more than just technical expertise. Figuring out what the client wants, collaborating in a team, managing complexity, mitigating risks, staying on time and budget, and determining under various constraints when a product is good enough to be shipped are at least equally important topics that often have a significant human component. 17-313 explores these issues broadly covering the fundamentals of modern software engineering.</description>

      <title>Using C# 9 records as strongly-typed ids</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/10/30/using-csharp-9-records-as-strongly-typed-ids/</link>
      <description>Strongly-typed ids Entities typically have integer, GUID or string ids, because those types are supported directly by databases. However, if all your entities have ids of the same type, it becomes pretty easy to mix them up, and use the id of a Product where the id of an Order was expected. This is actually a pretty common source of bugs.
