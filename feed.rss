      <title>N,N-dimethyltryptamine compound found in the hallucinogenic tea ayahuasca, regulates adult neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01011-0</link>
      <description>N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a component of the ayahuasca brew traditionally used for ritual and therapeutic purposes across several South American countries. Here, we have examined, in vitro and vivo, the potential neurogenic effect of DMT. Our results demonstrate that DMT administration activates the main adult neurogenic niche, the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, promoting newly generated neurons in the granular zone. Moreover, these mice performed better, compared to control non-treated animals, in memory tests, which suggest a functional relevance for the DMT-induced new production of neurons in the hippocampus. Interestingly, the neurogenic effect of DMT appears to involve signaling via sigma-1 receptor (S1R) activation since S1R antagonist blocked the neurogenic effect. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DMT treatment activates the subgranular neurogenic niche regulating the proliferation of neural stem cells, the migration of neuroblasts, and promoting the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus, therefore enhancing adult neurogenesis and improving spatial learning and memory tasks.</description>

      <title>Going all-in with nullable reference types</title>

      <description>I know I&amp;#39;m late to the party, but just recently had the opportunity to start using nullable reference types more seriously, so thought of gathering the first steps taken to go all in with it.

      <title>Ten Reasons for Tech Optimism in 2021</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2020/11/26/optimism.html</link>
      <description>I have written previously about losing my teenage optimism for technology, and how we struggle to have bold dreams for the future. Many people have articulated theses of this type, most famously Peter Thiel in claiming that we’ve seen great innovation in the world of bits, but not of atoms. However, change is in the air. I believe we are approaching an inflection point of technological change and ambition. In a twist of irony, COVID has done a great deal to push this along.</description>

      <link>https://nayak.io/posts/search-for-the-perfect-blog-post/</link>
      <description>One of the side goals of most developers is to maintain a blog. We spend an entire weekend trying to decide between Hugo or Gatsby and setting it up. Then going through the enormous list of community developed themes to pick one, only to spend an another weekend modifying it to a point where its no longer what it started out to be.
Repeat this formula a couple of times over the years and you have a blog which barely a few posts but has seen more iterations than the star wars franchise.</description>
