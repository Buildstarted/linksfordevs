      <title>Using use in Gleam</title>
      <link>https://erikarow.land/notes/using-use-gleam</link>
      <description>Recently, a colleague checked out Gleam’s language tour. They liked what they saw, but they were confused by Gleam’s use syntax. I like Gleam’s syntax a lotI even wrote an article about Gleam’s syntax., but I was also confused by use when I first encountered it. Here’s how I use use:The use expression was introduced in Gleam v0.25, as a more general replacement for the try keyword that preceded it.</description>

      <title>My Liner Notes for Spore</title>
      <link>https://www.chrishecker.com/My_Liner_Notes_for_Spore</link>
      <description>This page is intended to be a sort of liner notes for my contributions to Spore.  It&amp;#39;s a place for me to write up miscellaneous development comments about the parts of the game I worked on, while they&amp;#39;re still fresh in my mind.  I think the game had over 80 people working on it towards the end, and it was in development for more than 5 years, so basically everything in the game was touched by more than one person and was a team effort.  Given that, I will strive for inclusion and accuracy, and I will only talk about systems to which I made substantial contributions.  If I&amp;#39;ve left somebody out or made a mistake, I apologize; please email me and I&amp;#39;ll correct it immediately.</description>

      <description>We are in the midst of a hype around Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the market is trying to get ahead of each other in all sorts of ways. One way is to claim that their AI is open source. So far, there has been a lot of open washing, meaning that they claim they are open but failing to apply commo</description>

      <title>Borderless Is Inevitable</title>
      <link>https://www.jerry.wtf/posts/borderless-is-inevitable/</link>
      <description>
The world is shrinking, and some people are upset. Today I read on article on Hacker News “What does a world without Airbnb look like?” which talks about the negative sentiment against long-term tourists in Barcelona, and it corroborated the discussion I saw on the Digital Nomad subreddit yesterday “Cancel Barcelona Trip?”.
Mobility
When I was a kid, my family moved from China to Canada. The ease of it all seemed normal to me. Make a life in a new country? No big deal. As I grew up, I realized this wasn’t far from the truth for most of the developed world. If you’re in a Western country and dead set on becoming a citizen of another, is it really that hard? Not really.
This is the world we created after World War II. We asked for peace and open borders. Now we’re surprised when people use them?</description>

      <title>Self Documenting Code Is Bullshit – Klaus Breyer</title>
      <link>https://www.v01.io/posts/2024-self-documenting-code-is-bullshit/</link>
      <description>Hopefully, every development team reaches a point where they discuss their guidelines and policies. Part of this discussion, hopefully, includes expectations around documentation.
So far, so good. Unfortunately, many teams (and I have made this mistake in the past as well) take the easy route and claim they don’t need extensive documentation if they write self-documenting code. Besides the fact that this is just an easy way to avoid a discussion (because everyone interprets this differently), it is just plain wrong.</description>

      <description>I consider myself low on the spectrum of addict-ability: I don’t smoke, I rarely drink, I don’t gamble, I don’t have a video game addiction, and I don’t snack on sweets. But every man has his kryptonite, and a couple years ago I found myself compulsively checking the front page of Hacker News and various programming subreddits for the tech world’s latest goss.

      <title>My High School banned Phones... in 2011!</title>
      <link>https://www.neelc.org/posts/school-phone-ban/</link>
      <description>Today I read that many schools from NYC to LA want to ban smartphones in school. Well, let me tell you that my high school, Somers High School of Somers, NY (an rural-ish but rich NYC exurb) did actually ban phones back in 2011, and when I graduated in 2015 they still did.
When it comes to mobile tech, the early-to-mid-2010s were almost like the stone age. Whereas most of my peers had an iPhone on Verizon, my family chose to go with Samsung phones on Sprint.</description>

      <title>Migrating enterprise apps stuck on legacy technologies</title>
      <link>https://agostonbarna.github.io/posts/migrating-enterprise-apps-stuck-on-legacy-technologies/</link>
      <description>Enterprise applications often have a hefty and complex code base, mission-critical functionality, and a constant influx of feature demands that can result in a slower pace of dependency updates and a tendency to lag behind. This situation can worsen over time, as certain high-profile dependencies become outdated or discontinued, preventing the update of interlocked dependencies and leading to a cascade of technological stagnation. Eventually, this can reach a critical point, requiring big bang migrations to break free from the constraints of problematic legacy technologies.</description>

      <title>C++ Design Patterns for Low-latency Applications Including High-frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04259</link>
      <description>This work aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap in the optimisation of latency-critical code, specifically focusing on high-frequency trading (HFT) systems. The research culminates in three main contributions: the creation of a Low-Latency Programming Repository, the optimisation of a market-neutral statistical arbitrage pairs trading strategy, and the implementation of the Disruptor pattern in C++. The repository serves as a practical guide and is enriched with rigorous statistical benchmarking, while the trading strategy optimisation led to substantial improvements in speed and profitability. The Disruptor pattern showcased significant performance enhancement over traditional queuing methods. Evaluation metrics include speed, cache utilisation, and statistical significance, among others. Techniques like Cache Warming and Constexpr showed the most significant gains in latency reduction. Future directions involve expanding the repository, testing the optimised trading algorithm in a live trading environment, and integrating the Disruptor pattern with the trading algorithm for comprehensive system benchmarking. The work is oriented towards academics and industry practitioners seeking to improve performance in latency-sensitive applications.</description>
