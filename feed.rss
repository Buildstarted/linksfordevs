      <title>Dapr joins CNCF as an incubating project</title>
      <link>https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/11/03/dapr-joins-cncf-as-an-incubating-project/</link>
      <description>We’re happy to announce that this week, Dapr joined the CNCF as an incubating project. Ever since its initial launch, the Dapr project has made its intention clear that the project is eventually to be donated to a vendor-neutral foundation. The project recently formed a steering and technical committee that re-enforces our commitment to vendor neutrality by ensuring balanced representation in the committee across vendors.
The CNCF houses many projects with which Dapr integrates closely.</description>

      <title>A capturing lambda can be a coroutine, but you have to save your captures while you still can</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211103-00/?p=105870</link>
      <description>We saw some time ago that capturing lambdas which are coroutines result in lifetime issues because the lambda itself returns at the first suspension point, at which point there’s a good chance it will be destructed. After that point, any attempt by the lambda body to access those captured variables is a use-after-free bug.</description>

      <description>It’s not every day that you get to debug what may well be a packet of death. It was certainly the first time for me.
What do I mean by “a packet of death”? A software bug where the network stack crashes in reaction to a single received network packet, taking down the whole operating system with it.</description>

      <title>What is the Inverse of a Vector?</title>
      <link>https://mattferraro.dev/posts/geometric-algebra</link>
      <description>In this post we will re-invent an obscure form of math that is far superior to the one you learned in school. It is a better foundation for science and engineering, and it is a better foundation for students.</description>

      <title>Embracing the chaos</title>
      <link>https://ghvsted.com/blog/embracing-the-chaos/</link>
      <description>I like to make plans. Not the type of plans you make knowing you wouldn’t execute. I make plans hoping to execute them. I love structure. I’ve noticed I tend to gravitate towards situations that are more likely to provide some level of structure. I love, love, love the feeling I get whenever I make plans — not just whenever I make plans but when I see other people do stuff in a structured manner.</description>
