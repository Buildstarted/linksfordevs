      <title>Trying out Solid Queue and Mission Control with PostgreSQL</title>
      <link>https://andyatkinson.com/solid-queue-mission-control-rails-postgresql</link>
      <description>Why Solid Queue? Background jobs are commonly used in Ruby on Rails apps to perform any work possible outside of an HTTP request. A classic example is sending an email notification. Sending email from a background job places the latency there, outside of processing the request.</description>

      <description>When I was first starting my career at Amazon — even more bright-eyed and rosy-cheeked than I am now — I was thrilled by the concept of an &amp;quot;architecture review&amp;quot;, and by extension the concept of a &amp;quot;Principal Engineer&amp;quot; (Amazon&amp;#39;s term for a staff-level engineer, someone beyond career level) who was always treated with some level of mystique and reverence.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Guile Scheme — dthompson</title>
      <link>https://dthompson.us/posts/optimizing-guile-scheme.html</link>
      <description>Guile is a rather niche language
that I love dearly.  Guile is a Scheme dialect that features an
advanced optimizing bytecode compiler, a JIT compiler, and a modest
set of developer tools for inspecting and debugging.  Through my time
spent developing Chickadee, a game
programming library, I have gotten quite familiar with how to get the
most out of Guile in terms of performance.  Every now and then I share
a tip or two with someone on IRC or the fediverse and think “I should
blog about this” so now I’m finally doing that.  These tips are quite
simple and apply to optimizing any dynamic language.  The only
difference is that there isn’t much in the way of helpful examples
specifically for Guile… until now.</description>

      <title>The Middle-Manager Rotation: A Modest Proposal, Or Possibly A DevOps Parable</title>
      <link>https://pifke.org/posts/middle-manager-rotation/</link>
      <description>(This is almost-verbatim a memo I recently sent to company leadership.)
If we think the on-call rotation is working well and is an efficient use of personnel, I’d like to propose we fire all the middle-managers and replace the current management structure with an analogous “middle-manager rotation.”
My team’s developers spend—on average—about one day each month on-call for our products, and have about a month between their on-call shifts. We don’t currently have any full-time SREs assigned to respond to incidents for the product we’re building, work on observability, follow up on post-mortems, or other operational tasks.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing this a long time, and I’ve learned some stuff. A lot of the reasoning for why is simply learned experience, and to give you that experience I’d have to tell you long boring stories. Here are some notes which have been bouncing around my head which may be useful to you and, should you heed them, may save you a great deal of pain and time.
