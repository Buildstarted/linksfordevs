      <title>Surfacing Required Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://ferd.ca/surfacing-required-knowledge.html</link>
      <description>When I first started this blog, I had it in mind that I&amp;#39;d only write about things that were discrete and verifiable. I wanted to avoid doing the bullshit calls of being an Intellectual in Silicon Valley, or say to casting entire industries through one reductive lens (coming to mind is the old post from Steve Yegge on the now defunct google+ about framing software engineering as political affiliation), or god forbid, writing a blog post about &amp;quot;how to be a good &amp;lt;role&amp;gt;&amp;quot; which transparently is a text that just says &amp;quot;here&amp;#39;s how to be more like me.&amp;quot;</description>

      <title>Migrating from LastPass to pass – Zoned Out</title>
      <link>https://rhardih.io/2021/03/migrating-from-lastpass-to-pass/</link>
      <description>I’ve been using LastPass as a password manager since 2012 and even paid for the Premium subscription, so I could access it from my phone. That specific feature later turned free, and has recently turned paid again. It’s not that I’m unhappy with LastPass per se, or that I wouldn’t want to pay for the service again. I’ve just had my eye on an alternative with a bit more control in the past, e.g. self-hosted Bitwarden, but never really got a round to doing it. It just seemed like a little too much effort for very little.</description>

      <title>Jeremiah Reid - Time Travel Is ******* Hard</title>
      <link>http://jere.in/time-travel-is-hard</link>
      <description>For my fourth entry into the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge, I decided to go big. Time travel. Hundreds of years of procedural history. Procedural maps and biographies. Someone described the idea as &amp;quot;Dwarf Fortress Lite.&amp;quot; In other words, I was trying to develop a simplified version of a game that&amp;#39;s been in development for 14 years in a week. And I wanted to add time travel to it.</description>
