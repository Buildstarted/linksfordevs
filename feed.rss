      <title>10 Years Of Experience vs 10 Years Of The SAME Experience - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=d2l9WtDVc5s</link>
      <description>10 years is a LONG time to invest in anything -- so how should we think about this when it comes to our careers?

What&amp;#39;s the difference between 10 years of experience vs 10 years of the SAME experience? 

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>While Postgres Redlined, Robinhood Sharded to Scale</title>
      <link>https://tomlinford.com/posts/robinhood-sharding-to-scale/</link>
      <description>The alarm went off at 6:20am. I rolled out of bed, opened my laptop, and pulled up Grafana. Equity markets open at 6:30 and I hoped last night’s fixes would hold. I watched request and order counts, comparing them to a week ago when things ran fine. Slack was already buzzing with engineers also checking metrics.
The clock flipped to 6:30. The first metric tick came in, spiking the graphs. Okay, not bad. Next ticks pushed them higher, but error rates didn’t budge. It just needed to stay steady for a minute, then ease off. This could’ve been any morning from 2014, when we started bringing in external Robinhood customers, to 2024, when I left. I was an engineer and later a manager, mostly on brokerage systems.</description>

      <title>SWE-Bench+: Enhanced Coding Benchmark for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06992</link>
      <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) can offer assistance for coding. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation of LLMs in practical coding contexts, Carlos et al. introduced the SWE-bench dataset, which comprises 2,294 real-world GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests, collected from 12 widely used Python repositories. Several impressive LLM-based toolkits recently are developed and evaluated on this dataset. However, a systematic evaluation of the quality of SWE-bench remains missing. In this paper, we addressed this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the SWE-bench dataset. We conducted a manual screening of instances where SWEAgent + GPT-4 successfully resolved issues by comparing the model-generated patches with the actual pull requests. SWE-Agent+GPT-4 was at the top of SWE-bench leaderboard during the time of our study. Our analysis reveals some critical issues with the SWE-bench dataset: 1) 32.67% of the successful patches involve cheating as the solutions were directly provided in the issue report or the comments. We refer to as solution leakage problem. 2) 31.08% of the passed patches are suspicious patches due to weak test cases, i.e., the tests were not adequate to verify the correctness of a patch. When we filtered out these problematic issues, the resolution rate of SWE-Agent+GPT-4 dropped from 12.47% to 3.97%. We also observed that the same data quality issues also exist in the two variants of SWE-bench, i.e., SWE-bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified. In addition, over 94% of the issues were created before LLM&amp;#39;s knowledge cutoff dates, posing potential data leakage issues.</description>

      <description>Ever feel like you’re copy-pasting the same Terraform code over and over again? Deploying resource groups, VMs, networks—all with slightly different names? Yeah, that’s a nightmare waiting to happen. Luckily, Terraform modules exist to make our lives easier! Modules let you write infrastructure code once and reuse it across different projects, environments, or even teams.</description>
