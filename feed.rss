      <description>I've been comparing notes with people who run corporate engineering blogs and one thing that I think is curious is that it's pretty common for my personal blog to get more traffic than the entire corp eng blog for a company with a nine to ten figure valuation and it's not uncommon for my blog to get an order of magnitude more traffic.</description>

      <description>When you inject events into the cloud, do you care whether they come out in the same order they went in?  If you do, you’ll be
    asking for “FIFO” (rhymes with “Fly, foe!”) (stands for “First In First Out”). Some software has it, some doesn’t.</description>

      <description>What happened was, at re:Invent 2019 I gave a talk entitled
    Moving to Event-Driven Architecture, discussing a list of
    characteristics that distinguish eventing and messaging services.  It was a lot of work pulling the
    material together and I’ve learned a couple of things since then; thus, welcome to the
    Eventing Facets blog series, of which this is the hub. It’s going to
    take a while to fill this out.</description>

      <description>When you fire an event into the cloud, can you be sure it’ll only come out again once?  It turns out that 
    sometimes they come out more often than they go in.  This may or may not be a problem in your
    application. If it is, there are techniques to help work around it.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core - JSON logger</title>
      <link>https://www.meziantou.net/asp-net-core-json-logger.htm</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core supports a logging API that works with a variety of built-in and third-party logging providers. The built-in providers allow to log to the console, the debug output or as ETW messages.
In my case I needed to output the messages and their associated data to console as JSON. This means I had to create a custom logger and integrate it in the ASP.NET Core application.
