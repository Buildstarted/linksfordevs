      <title>Evolving Languages Faster with Type Tailoring</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2024-07-15_type_tailoring/</link>
      <description>Programming languages are too slow! I’m not talking about execution speed—I’m talking about evolution speed. Programmers are always building new libraries and embedded DSLs, but the host programming language—particularly its type system—doesn’t understand the domain-specific aspects of these things.</description>

      <title>Why Attend Programming Conferences?</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m sitting on a barely delayed1 train on my way back from PyCon &amp;#39;24 in Berlin. This was the second time I attended an industry/programming conference, after attending JupyterCon last year. This year I had to convince my manager to get the greenlight to go, so I thought I would write down my thoughts about why it&amp;#39;s worth going to conferences and how I can convince my manager next year.</description>

      <title>How I Use Git Worktrees</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2024/07/25/git-worktrees.html</link>
      <description>There are a bunch of posts on the internet about using git worktree command. As far as I can tell,
most of them are primarily about using worktrees as a replacement of, or a supplement to git
branches. Instead of switching branches, you just change directories. This is also how I originally
had used worktrees, but that didn&amp;#39;t stick, and I abandoned them. But recently worktrees grew
on me, though my new use-case is unlike branching.</description>

      <description>In 1970s Poland, Jacek Karpiński created a computer which could conduct a million operations per second and was small enough to fit into a briefcase. At a time when computers were not only slower but also comparable in size to cupboards, this was a remarkable accomplishment. Unfortunately, the communist regime blocked the device.</description>

      <title>Developers want more, more, more: the 2024 results from Stack Overflow’s Annual Developer Survey - Stack Overflow</title>
      <link>https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/07/24/developers-want-more-more-more-the-2024-results-from-stack-overflow-s-annual-developer-survey/</link>
      <description>In May of 2024, we opened up the 14th annual Stack Overflow Developer Survey to technologists worldwide—and the results are in! This year, technologies such as JavaScript and PostgreSQL remain most popular, Rust and Markdown remain most admired, developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work, and they don’t see AI as a threat to their jobs. Themes we see in this year’s survey results show us that developers are not threatened by AI, and developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work. On the topic of AI, 76% of respondents shared they are using or planning to use AI tools, but only 43% said they trust the accuracy of AI tools and 45% believe AI tools struggle to handle complex tasks.</description>

      <title>&amp;lt;Linear Algebra for Data Science&amp;gt; – Kyunghyun Cho</title>
      <link>https://kyunghyuncho.me/linear-algebra-for-data-science/</link>
      <description>We (Prof. Wanmo Kang and Prof. Kyunghyun Cho) have been discussing over the past few years how we should teach linear algebra to students in this new era of data science and artificial intelligence. Over these discussions, which also led to some research collaboration as well, we realized that (one of the central concepts from linear algebra that is used frequently in practice, if not every day, was) the central concepts from linear algebra invoked frequently in practice, if not every day, were projection, and consequently singular value decomposition (SVD) as well as even less frequently positive definiteness. Unfortunately, we noticed that existing courses on linear algebra often focus much more on the invertibility (or lack thereof), to the point that many concepts are introduced not in the order of their practicality nor usefulness but in the order of the conveniences in mathematical derivations/introductions. We began to wonder a lot whether we can introduce concepts and results in linear algebra in a radically different way.</description>

      <title>Reverse-engineering my speakers&amp;#39; API to get reasonable volume control</title>
      <link>https://jamesbvaughan.com/volume-controller-1/</link>
      <description>I got some fancy new speakers last week.
They’re powered speakers and they have streaming service integrations built in, unlike the 35-year-old passive speakers I’m upgrading from. Overall they’re great! But they’re so loud that it’s difficult to make small volume adjustments within the range of safe volume levels for my apartment.
To solve that, I’m building a custom volume knob for them them that will give me more precise control within the range I like to listen in.</description>
