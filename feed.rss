      <title>Cargo Culting Software Engineering Practices</title>
      <link>https://isthisit.nz/posts/2022/cargo-culting-software-engineering-practices/</link>
      <description>Three months into my first Big Tech gig I was talking to a mentor about the overhead involved with the way the organisation worked. Meetings for standups, tech huddles, refinements, retros and product reviews; Processes such as limiting work in progress, desk checks, spikes, stories, and tasks. Coming from a startup we delivered high quality software without all of that labelled process. The mentor lent me his copy of Extreme Programming by Kent Beck, and that book gave me a framework to develop my own philosophy on software delivery and engineering practices.</description>

      <link>https://jason5lee.me/2022/06/05/understanding-kotlin-coroutine/</link>
      <description>Coroutine is a mechanism in Kotlin to simplify writing concurrent programs. But the concept of coroutine seems to be not very easy to understand. In this article, I will introduce my intuitive understanding of coroutines. This article won&amp;#39;t go into too much detail, focusing on providing a familiar metaphor for this seemingly unfamiliar concept.</description>
