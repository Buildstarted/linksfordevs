      <title>Worth Reading - Gen Z, millennials: A college degree is a waste of money and time</title>
      <link>https://www.mikemcbrideonline.com/2025/05/worth-reading-gen-z-millennials-a-college-degree-is-a-waste-of-money-and-time/</link>
      <description>When you're looking at student loan debt and an uncertain job market, while being asked to learn new skills, it's understandable to question what all that college was for in the first place. I'm not saying there's no value in a college education. Still, the cost-benefit analysis is changing for many people right now, because learning and upskilling won't stop when school is over. They keep going, and it's only going to keep happening faster. </description>

      <description>When crabs are thrown into a bucket, they instinctively grab at other crabs trying to climb out. As a group, crabs in a bucket pull each other down, preventing one another from escaping.</description>

      <title>The Art of SQL Query Optimization</title>
      <link>https://jnidzwetzki.github.io/2025/06/03/art-of-query-optimization.html</link>
      <description>SQL is a declarative language; only the result of the query is specified. The exact steps to produce the result must be determined by the DBMS. Often, multiple ways exist to calculate a query result. For example, the DBMS can choose to use an index or perform a sequential scan on a table to find the needed tuples. The query optimizer is responsible for finding the most efficient plan for a given query. The plan generator creates possible plans, which are then evaluated based on their costs. Afterward, the cheapest plan is chosen and executed. When the DBMS expects to return a large portion of the table, a full table scan can be more efficient than following the pointers in an index structure. However, it is hard to determine when the DBMS prefers one plan over another and when the switch between plans occurs. In a few evenings of vibe coding, I implemented the plan explorer for PostgreSQL. It iterates over a search space and generates visualizations that show when the plan changes and how many tuples are expected versus the actual number returned. This blog post examines the “art” of query optimization. It discusses the plan explorer tool, the images the tool generates, and the insights the tool provides into the decisions made by the PostgreSQL query optimizer.</description>

      <title>Why Open Source Maintainers Thrive in the LLM Era</title>
      <link>https://mikemcquaid.com/why-open-source-maintainers-thrive-in-the-llm-era/</link>
      <description>At the time of writing (June 2025), the prevailing view in the software industry is that LLM-powered AI is either completely useless or will imminently destroy all software engineering jobs. As you might expect, the reality is somewhere in between. In this post, I’ll share my journey with LLM tooling, from reviewing an early, internal alpha of GitHub Copilot to my current daily usage of Cursor, ChatGPT, and the latest Copilot offerings. My perspective is that of a startup founder (of Workbrew) and long-time open source software maintainer (of Homebrew)</description>

      <title>Persistent storage is for cowards | Lukas Knuth</title>
      <link>https://lknuth.dev/writings/persistent_storage_cowards/</link>
      <description>About a year ago, I rebuild my home server. It still runs on Kubernetes, but I moved away from traditional tooling associated with it. The goal was simplicity; and I made some opinionated choices to achieve it. For example, I deploy everything using Terraform with the Kubernetes provider - no more YAML!
For hardware, I just have a single Raspberry Pi 4. There is no external storage attached to it, so everything is on an SD Card that could be corrupted at any point. I would like very much for my application data to not be lost when that happens though.</description>
