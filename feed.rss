      <title>15,000 lines of verified cryptography now in Python</title>
      <link>https://jonathan.protzenko.fr/2025/04/18/python.html</link>
      <description>In November 2022, I opened issue 99108 on Python’s GitHub repository, arguing that after a recent CVE in its implementation of SHA3, Python should embrace verified code for all of its hash-related infrastructure.</description>

      <title>The world needs you to consume less news</title>
      <link>https://danbartlett.co.uk/the-world-needs-you-to-consume-less-news/</link>
      <description>It’s considered good and upstanding to stay on top of world affairs. You want to be educated about the world, right? But there is so much to keep up on. So much injustice to counter.
I’m here to tell you that the world needs you to consume less news. I know you’re doing it from a good place but I think you should take a break.
First, the expectation to “stay on top of things” is a modern invention. Something only possible during the most recent fraction of human history. For most of history, news travelled slowly—by word of mouth, by post, by pigeon. Now it shrieks at us from every screen, 24/7. This is not normal. It’s not neutral either.</description>

      <title>The Move Faster Manifesto</title>
      <link>http://brianguthrie.com/p/the-move-faster-manifesto/</link>
      <description>I’ve worked in the software industry for over twenty years. I have been a consultant, a line engineer, a director, a founder, and a CTO. I have worked at firms as small as two engineers and as large as fifty thousand. I frequently get asked how to move faster in software. This is what I say. It is easier to describe than it is to do. Rules for moving faster I am not some kind of process relativist; process matters.</description>

      <description>Throughout the countless years of research on this blog a common thread always comes up: Some features and toggles are often hidden under mountains of hubris that nobody understands. It could be because the software is under-or-badly documented, that it's 'too-flexible' and made to handle cases that never materialize, or just that...</description>

      <title>Linux is now the best gaming system. ｜ fernvenue's Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/linux-is-now-the-best-gaming-system/</link>
      <description>When it comes to gaming on Linux, many many many people’s understanding stil remains in the Jurassic era. For the past few years, I’ve been using Linux as my main operating system for both work and gaming. From my personal experience, the gaming experience on Linux is far superior to that of macOS and Windows. I know I know…whenever I mention this, there are always some old-school individuals who come out to say that Linux’s driver configuration is complex, its game support is not rich enough, and its compatibility issues are significant, among other problems. In this article, I will directly address these issues and let everyone understand how much the gaming experience on Linux has developed by 2025.</description>

      <description>The Pareto Principle, also called the 80/20 rule, states that a few things (the vital few) are much more important than most things (the trivial many). I came across this principle many years ago, in Richard Koch’s wonderful book.</description>

      <description>GPU programming used to mean wrangling C++ compilers, bloated SDKs, and vendor-specific toolchains. That’s changing. You can now write GPU code in modern languages like Rust and Zig with fewer layers. This post walks through the current state of Zig’s GPU backends and how they stack up across Vulkan, OpenCL, and native ISAs.</description>

      <title>The Fatal Intro Mistake Most Speakers Make (And How to Avoid It)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=elbwGuSs1dM</link>
      <description>You have just 90 seconds to grab your audience's attention at the start of your talk—or they've mentally checked out. In this video, I reveal why most speakers waste this critical window and how you can use the "cold open" technique to instantly captivate your audience.

Hi, I'm James, a storytelling technologist who's spoken at over 30 conferences worldwide. I've experienced it all—from people scrolling through their phones to audience members falling asleep in the front row. Let me help you avoid these speaking disasters.

What You'll Learn:
- Why starting with your bio is killing your talk before it even begins
- How to use the "James Bond technique" to hook your audience immediately
- The exact moment when you should introduce yourself (hint: it's not when you think)
- Two contrasting real-life examples that demonstrate effective vs. ineffective openings
- How to establish credibility without boring your audience

This video builds on our previous lesson about making the audience the hero of your story and shows you exactly how to put this principle into practice in those crucial first moments on stage.

👉 Remember: Your audience decides within 90 seconds whether they're going to pay attention to your entire talk. Make those seconds count!</description>

      <description>If you invest a little time understanding how the components of your database system fit together—not even the internals, just the externals—you’ll be able to move faster, debug better, and build cleaner workflows with more confidence. It only needs some upfront investment of learning the basics and confidence that you can build along the way.</description>

      <title>Google Gemini in .NET: The Ultimate Guide with Jochen Kirstaetter</title>

      <description>RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Software Development Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes "So on my side it was actually, the interesting experience was that I kind of used it one way, because it was mainly about reading the Python code, the JavaScript code, and, let’s say like, the Go implementations, trying to understand what are the concepts, what are the ways about how it has been implemented by the different teams. And then, you know, switching mentally into the other direction of writing than the code in C#."— Jochen Kirstaetter

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie “GaProgMan” Taylor.

 In this episode, Jochen Kirstaetter joined us to talk about his .NET SDK for interacting with Google’s Gemini suite of LLMs. Jochen tells us that he started his journey by looking at the existing .NET SDK, which didn’t seem right to him, and wrote his own using the HttpClient and HttpClientFactory classes and REST.

 "I provide a test project with a lot of tests. And when you look at the simplest one, is that you get your instance of the Generative AI type, which you pass in either your API key, if you want to use it against Google AI, or you pass in your project ID and location if you want to use it against Vertex AI. Then you specify which model that you like to use, and you specify the prompt, and the method that you call is then GenerateContent and you get the response back. So effectively with four lines of code you have a full integration of Gemini into your .NET application."— Jochen Kirstaetter

 Along the way, we discuss the fact that Jochen had to look into the Python, JavaScript, and even Go SDKs to get a better understanding of how his .NET SDK should work. We discuss the “Pythonistic .NET” and “.NETy Python” code that developers can accidentally end up writing, if they’re not careful when moving from .NET to Python and back. And we also talk about Jochen’s use of tests as documentation for his SDK.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.
