      <description>Previously in Phi-3-mini in 30 lines of C# with ONNX Runtime GenAI and Phi-3-vision in 50
lines of C# with ONNX Runtime GenAI I showed how easy it was to run
small Phi-3 models locally in just a few lines of C#. In this blog post I show
how you can export another model, in this case Meta’s
Llama-3-8B-Instruct,
with Model Builder for ONNX Runtime GenAI.

      <title>Random and fixed routes with Apache APISIX</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/fixed-routes-apisix/</link>
      <description>My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at Apache APISIX. Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:     We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I’ll give an example for better understanding.   We have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html a</description>

      <description>So, here’s a question - when were you last excited for a new phone? Well, I mean really excited?
Here’s the thing. Phones are so boring today that most retail stores show you the backside of the phone. Because from the front they all look exactly the same.</description>

      <title>Why Search is not a solved problem yet</title>

      <description>Nearly 35 years has passed from the advent of search engines.
With 90% of the market share, Google search’s user experience has been relatively stagnant for a long time barring the recent AI Overviews feature. Most of the alternatives till a couple of years ago were still mimicking Google search experience but with more privacy guarantees and better control over ranking.
With the recent breakthrough in Generative AI and some new solutions gaining traction, Search offerings now can be broadly bifurcated into two types:</description>

      <title>the how and the why</title>
      <link>https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/10/the-how-and-the-why/</link>
      <description>This is likely to be the first in a series of meditations on the college decision-making process. My two younger kids are embarking on the process now, so I’m thinking about the subject personally; my job as a professor means I’m thinking about it in my workplace, too. And I hardly need to say that the big questions are in the zeitgeist after this academic year: What kind of four-year experiences are worth paying for? What’s available in that developmental window that can be nurtured and drawn out in young people? For people who go to college, that period is one of the hinge moments to adulthood that can be life-changing in lasting ways. How should a parent think about it?</description>

      <link>https://timmoth.github.io/AsyncMonolith/posts/idempotency/</link>
      <description>Idempotency refers to the ability of an operation to be performed multiple times whilst still yielding the same outcome. It is a critical property of handlers in an event driven system, since events can be reprocessed due to retries, network issues, or other failures. Without idempotency, reprocessing the same event could lead to inconsistent states, duplicate entries, or other unintended side effects.</description>

Many of us start blogs, but most of those blogs lie abandoned or sporadically updated.
It&amp;#39;s okay if you start blogging and figure out it&amp;#39;s not really for you.
But there are also some common issues that block people who want to write a blog for fun or to improve as a writer1.</description>
