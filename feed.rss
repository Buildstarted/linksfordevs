      <title>Big (tech) company bullshit</title>
      <link>https://phillipcarter.dev/posts/big-company-bullshit/</link>
      <description>When I worked for Microsoft, I regularly talked directly to users and customers of the software I worked on. Because nobody tells you each time their code compiles successfully, I’d usually hear from them when things were broken or unsatisfying. Most of these problems would be straightforward - we messed up and regressed something, there was a latent bug in the system someone found, we hadn’t implemented a feature that someone thinks is really important, and so on.</description>

To achieve it in .NET you can do it using a library or writing your own defensive code, in this article I’ll show you …</description>

      <description>When designing web APIs, it&amp;#39;s important to think about how the data being passed to and from the endpoint will be structured. How important is reuse in these considerations, and how much reuse can you get away with before it starts causing other problems?</description>

      <title>Machine readable specifications at scale</title>
      <link>https://alastairreid.github.io/mrs-at-scale/</link>
      <description>There are lots of potential uses for machine readable specifications
so you would think that every major real world artifact like long-lived
hardware and software systems, protocols, languages, etc. would have
a formal specification that is used by all teams extending the design,
creating new implementations, testing/verifying the system, verifying
code that uses the system, doing security analyses or any of the other
potential uses.
But, in practice, this is usually not true: most real world systems do not
have a well tested, up to date, machine readable specification.

      <title>What are these weird internal Visual C++ runtime functions named NLG?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220126-00/?p=106197</link>
      <description>If you’re looking at dump files or doing live debugging, you may encounter functions whose names begin with NLG: _NLG_Notify, _NLG_Notify1, _NLG_Dispatch, _NLG_Return, _NLG_Return2&amp;#185; and a few more. What are they for, and what does NLG stand for? These functions are part of the Visual C++ runtime’s internal exception handling infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Fixing Windows Control Focus on Toolbar and Menu Controls</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/25/Fixing-Windows-Control-Focus-on-Toolbar-and-Menu-Controls</link>
      <description>You ever run into a problem in a Windows application where saving data off a Menu or Toolbar doesn&amp;#39;t save the last changed value? Well, it&amp;#39;s a pretty common problem in Windows Applications that&amp;#39;s due to the fact that these controls don&amp;#39;t change the active control focus which in turn can fail to update data binding from updating the underlying data source. In this post I go into detail on why this happens and describe a few workarounds.</description>
