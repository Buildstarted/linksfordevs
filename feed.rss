      <title>Achieving 11M IOPS &amp;amp; 66 GB/s IO on a Single ThreadRipper Workstation - Tanel Poder Consulting</title>
      <link>https://tanelpoder.com/posts/11m-iops-with-10-ssds-on-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/</link>
      <description>TL;DR Modern disks are so fast that system performance bottleneck shifts to RAM access and CPU. With up to 64 cores, PCIe 4.0 and 8 memory channels, even a single-socket AMD ThreadRipper Pro workstation makes a hell of a powerful machine - if you do it right!
 Introduction In this post I&amp;amp;rsquo;ll explain how I configured my AMD ThreadRipper Pro workstation with 10 PCIe 4.0 SSDs to achieve 11M IOPS with 4kB random reads and 66 GiB/s throughput with larger IOs - and what bottlenecks &amp;amp;amp; issues I fixed to get there. - Linux, Oracle, SQL performance tuning and troubleshooting - consulting &amp;amp; training.</description>

      <title>The Psychology of Stock Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://halldorbjarni.github.io/the-psychology-of-stock-bubbles/</link>
      <description>The recent 800% rally in the stock of brick-and-mortar video game store GameStop over the span of a couple of days, in the middle of a pandemic, seems to defy all laws of financial theory. Surely new information didn’t come forward so that the value of the business could suddenly grow 22 billions in just over 5 days. However, it is hardly the first time such bubbles have happened in individual stock issues. For example, Qualcomm rose a whopping 2,619% in the middle of the dot-com bubble before cratering when the bubble popped in 2000. And keep in mind that bubbles have been occurring long before the advent of technology and globalization. Back in the 18th century the Mississippi Company, a French trading company, rose 3,000% before losing more than 50% of its value the next year1. But what causes these bubbles to happen in the first place?&amp;#160;                 The Mississippi Bubble, or How the French Eliminated All Their Government Debt (So Why Can’t Bernanke?), 2013&amp;#160;↩</description>

      <title>Friday Facts #364 - 1.1 stable | Factorio</title>
      <link>https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-364</link>
      <description>Hello, we have a stable version! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When we were releasing the 1.0 FFF-360, we actually stated that there were &amp;quot;around 150 bugs on the forums and around 80 internal tasks to be solved&amp;quot;. These were obviously minor issues, things hard to reproduce or very rare problems. In other words, it was quite reasonably stable, which normally goes without saying when it comes to Factorio stable versions. But it proved to be a mistake wording it this way, since some media picked up on it and presented it as a &amp;quot;fairly bugged release&amp;quot;. 
 
 
 
So I&amp;#39;m pretty thrilled to finally get to the point, where we actually have 0 known issues and 0 active bug reports on the forums. Its like cleaning the kitchen properly, so you can start cooking something fresh....</description>

      <description>Last time, we implemented autoscroll speed based on the mouse’s velocity. But our implementation didn’t support the popular bug-that-is-now-a-feature where wiggling the mouse makes the window scroll faster. Let’s bring that back. void OnMouseMove(HWND hwnd, int x, int y, UINT keyFlags) {   if (g_fDragging) {     if (g_dyAutoScroll == 0) {       int direction = DetectAutoScroll({ x,</description>

      <title>.NET GC Internals – the Mark phase – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/net-gc-internals-the-mark-phase/</link>
      <description>Hi and welcome to the second episode of the .NET GC internals! Yesterday is was 1.5h of talking about the (non-concurrent) Mark phase. The one responsible for discovering which object are “reachable” and which may be garbage collected. I’ve covered topics like object graph traversal algorithm, the pinning and marking flag, the mark stack and mark list data structures. And obviously, some deep dive into the gc.cpp at the end.</description>
