      <title>What to learn</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/learn-what/</link>
      <description>It&amp;#39;s common to see people advocate for learning skills that they have or using processes that they use. For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you&amp;#39;ll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That&amp;#39;s not untrue, but it&amp;#39;s also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you can say that about many different areas of computer science and math. Queuing theory, computer architecture, mathematical optimization, operations research, etc.</description>

      <title>My indoor rowing tips after 15 million meters</title>
      <link>https://onlyrss.org/posts/my-rowing-tips-after-15-million-meters.html</link>
      <description>I bought my Concept 2 Model C
                    rower
                    in 2001, my plan (like most people who buy exercise equipment) was to use it every week. And, like
                    most
                    people, I failed. I used the rower sporadically for a while, and then I moved house, and it just sat
                    there in my new home, gathering dust. I&amp;#39;d get the urge to start using it again (yes...January) and
                    as usual, it didn&amp;#39;t last. I&amp;#39;ve always done some form of exercise, either in the gym or running,
                    and have had some long periods of running every week, but I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve ever exercised
                    consistently every week for a period longer than a year.</description>

      <title>What every software engineer should know about search</title>
      <link>https://scribe.rip/p/what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-search-27d1df99f80d</link>
      <description>Ask a software engineer: “How would you add search functionality to your product?” or “How do I build a search engine?” You’ll probably immediately hear back something like: “Oh, we’d just launch an ElasticSearch cluster. Search is easy these days.”
 
But is it? Numerous current products still have suboptimal search experiences. Any true search expert will tell you that few engineers have a very deep understanding of how search engines work, knowledge that’s often needed to improve search quality.</description>

      <title>How can I get the screen reader to read out an error message that I displayed inline on a page?</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211018-00/?p=105808</link>
      <description>It’s the current fashion to show error messages inline, rather than displaying a pop-up error message. Password: •••••&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The password is incorrect. Please recheck it and try again. This looks prettier, I guess, but it does cause problems with screen readers.</description>
