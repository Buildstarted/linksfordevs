      <title>The Ability to Improve</title>
      <link>https://bec-systems.com/2267/the-ability-to-improve/</link>
      <description>(while this article contains many general ideas, it is written from the perspective of product development.) If you don&amp;#39;t continually improve, you soon lose the ability to do so … This thought came after an associate described a company that is struggling to manufacture one of their products: They have been making a product sinceRead More &amp;#187;The Ability to Improve</description>

      <title>A Kinder Approach to Success</title>
      <link>https://www.girish.blog/p/a-kinder-approach-to-success</link>
      <description>Anatomy of success Spectacular achievements happen over time. It’s actually an amount of skill in an area thats multiplied over time that leads to spectacular success. We don’t have to concern ourselves with the skills part of this equation as that itself can be boiled down to an endeavour you undertake over time.</description>

      <title>10 years in Open Source</title>
      <link>https://ochagavia.nl/blog/10-years-in-open-source/</link>
      <description>Today marks 10 years since my first pull request to the Rust compiler. Though I’m no open source legend, to me it’s an important date still. As I’ve mentioned in the past, my involvement in Rust was pivotal to my development as a software engineer, so I can’t let this day pass without a mention in my blog!
How did it happen that I, a bored student yearning to learn interesting stuff, ended up contributing to Rust?</description>

      <description>VLC wasn’t born like other media players.
                  It wasn’t cooked up in some Silicon Valley tech-giant’s lab,
                  fed on venture capital, and released into the world like a
                  pampered prince. VLC is more of a phoenix, rising from the
                  ashes of a French academic project from the bygone days of
                  1996, known as the VideoLAN project.
                
                  In the beginning, VLC was just a client, a humble part of the
                  grand scheme known as VideoLAN. The “VideoLAN Client” they
                  called it, before its baptism as VLC. Imagine it — a kid
                  trying to fit into a world that hadn’t yet recognized its
                  value. VLC was a rebel, designed to stream videos from
                  satellite dishes across a university campus. It was a tool
                  created by students, not corporations, out of necessity rather
                  than for profit.</description>

      <description>Building tools for creative endeavors is a unique challenge. It is a place where rigorous engineering meets the boundless creative process. The inherent contrasts and complementary forces between the systematic approach of engineering processes and the inherently chaotic nature of the creative process is a unique dichotomy that requires a unique approach.</description>

      <title>State of the Terminal | g.p. anders</title>
      <link>https://gpanders.com/blog/state-of-the-terminal/</link>
      <description>This is a companion article to my talk at Neovimconf 2023.
I have been using Vim/Neovim as my full time text editor for close to 10 years. I’ve spent a lot of time in the terminal and have become very aware of the many flaws and idiosyncrasies of this bizarre platform. But I also think it gets a lot of things right! And I’m not alone in this belief: terminal based tools are still widely popular even in the presence of many alternatives (the StackOverflow developer survey shows that Neovim is the “most loved” editor 3 years in a row).</description>

      <description>Software people are always all up in the XY problem: someone asks about how to do X when what they’re really trying to solve is Y. I find the YX problem much more frustrating: where software people decide that they want to answer question Y even though what someone asks is question X.</description>

      <title>Conversational Spaced Repetition | David Bieber</title>
      <link>https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2024-03-04-conversational-spaced-repetition/</link>
      <description>I learn a lot from talking to large language models (LLMs) like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude. Frequently I’ll ask the LLM to quiz me on what it’s taught me, in order to test my understanding of what I’ve learned. I find that doing so helps me learn the material better, promoting longer term recall. Even with this strategy in place, however, I still forget a lot of what I’ve learned from these AI assistants.</description>

      <description>Over the course of 2023-ish I wrote two Python frameworks (1) (1)I’d like to avoid a semantic debate, but for clarity’s sake when I say, “framework” I mean a library that holistically and generically targets the way you write applications (or tests in the case of sundew) rather than providing a narrow set of functionality. I think there is some unique consideration you have to have when targeting the whole way a developer builds software, but by I expect these learnings are things that would apply to development of any kind of library that you intend other people to use.</description>

      <link>https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/812-Convenient_sandboxed_development_environment</link>
      <description>I like using one machine and setup for everything, from serious development work to hobby projects to managing my finances. This is very convenient, as often the lines between these are blurred. But it is also scary if I think of the large number of people who I have to trust to not want to extract all my personal data. Whenever I run a cabal install, or a fun VSCode extension gets updated, or anything like that, I am running code that could be malicious or buggy.</description>
