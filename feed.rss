      <title>Building a GPS Receiver, Part 1: Hearing Whispers</title>
      <link>https://axleos.com/building-a-gps-receiver-part-1-hearing-whispers/</link>
      <description>Have you ever noticed that your Maps app still works during a flight? It can feel illicit, like someone just forgot to turn off the signal, and that watching yourself crawl along the earth should be done without drawing undue attention. A few months ago I learned that there were only around 30 GPS satellites serving the entire planet. This piqued my interest, because it reminded me of the 13 root DNS servers from which all resolution flows. Perhaps GPS has a similar design in which the ‘source of truth’ is diluted by several layers of signal repeaters? I navigated to gps.gov, and was presented with this delightful image. I became even more excited to learn about what these satellites do!</description>

      <description>Almost every software engineer - irrespective of their tech stack - writes code collaboratively via Git. They submit their fixes or features as changesets. One of their colleagues then reviews the changeset and approves or rejects it. This reviewer must approve your changeset before it can be merged and deployed.</description>

      <description>We spend a lot of time suing embezzlers. All over the world. Week in and week out. Big embezzlers, small embezzlers, smart embezzlers and very smart embezzlers… That’s right, no dumb embezzlers because almost all the embezzlers we encounter are smart. Some are very smart. Some are brilliant. And, almost always, most would have made more money and had a more profitable career if they had simply stopped stealing and starting working honestly.</description>
