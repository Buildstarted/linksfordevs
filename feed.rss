      <title>12 Months, 12 Books: My Yearlong Journey to Learn, Grow, and Level Up - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/12-months-12-books-my-yearlong-journey-to-learn-grow-and-level-up/</link>
      <description>As we enter a new year, I’m focusing on personal and professional growth as a developer. The tech industry evolves at breakneck speed, and staying ahead requires more than mastering the latest tools and frameworks. To truly excel, developers must dive deep into their craft, exploring timeless programming principles, leadership, collaboration, and personal development. With their ability to distill the wisdom of experienced professionals, books remain one of the best ways to gain these insights. That’s why I’ve set a personal goal for 2025: to read one transformative book each month.</description>

      <description>The Game Boy Advance is an interesting game console. It has a modern-style CPU (32-bit ARM, lots of registers), but uses an old-fashioned tile based renderer like how the NES did it in the 80s. Don’t get me wrong, since its one of Nintendo’s last tile-based systems, they took the idea as far as it can go with fancy features like affine transformations, transparency, and effects applied to sprites. But at its core, it occupies a very unique space:</description>

      <link>https://wilsoniumite.com/2024/12/30/if-i-could-wave-a-magic-wand/</link>
      <description>We often talk about rewriting code and almost as often talk about whether big rewrites are even a good idea. Joel Spolsky writes a particularly harrowing story of how netscape rewrote their entire codebase and in so doing perhaps doomed their chances of recovery. In summary, here are some key things you need to keep in mind when considering to rewrite something.</description>

      <title>An honest review of my last year building Chessbook</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/chessbook-year-review-2024</link>
      <description>With the year coming to an end, I’ve been reflecting on what has gone well and what can be improved. Naturally, this being the first year I’ve been full-time on my own project, a lot of that reflection has centered around Chessbook. So here’s my relatively unfiltered thoughts on what went well and what didn’t go so well.
Personal productivity 3/5 Maintaining my personal productivity is a constant battle. I had some really great stretches this year, but especially in the latter third it’s been a struggle.</description>
