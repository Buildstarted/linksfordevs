      <title>The 8 most missing features in C# – TooSlowException</title>
      <link>https://tooslowexception.com/the-8-most-missing-features-in-c/</link>
      <description>Sometimes you may hear oppinions that there are too many changes introduced to the C# and/or too fast. That people get lost and confused about all this new syntax and feature added here and there. And while one may argue or not, I would like to look at this topic from a different angle – what are you missing in C#? What single functionality would you enjoy the most?</description>

      <title>Semantic Versioning Will Not Save You</title>
      <link>https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/</link>
      <description>The widely used Python package cryptography changed their build system to use Rust for low-level code which caused an emotional GitHub thread. Enthusiasts of 32-bit hardware from the 1990s aside, there was a vocal faction that stipulated adherence to Semantic Versioning from the maintainers – claiming it would’ve prevented all grief. I will show you not only why this is wrong, but also how relying on Semantic Versioning hurts you.</description>

      <description>Open Source is everywhere. It is in many proprietary codebases and community projects. For organizations and individuals, the question today is not whether you are or are not using open-source code, but what open-source code you are using, and how much.If you are not aware of what is in your software supply chain, an upstream vulnerability in one of your dependencies can be fatal, making you, and your customers, vulnerable to a potential compromise.Today, we are announcing the public availability of NuGet’s vulnerability features that you can use to ensure your projects are vulnerability free and if not, to take action to securing your software supply chain.</description>

      <title>Video Game Programming From Scratch with Casey Muratori - CoRecursive Podcast</title>

      <description>
I&amp;#39;m not really a big gamer, but lately, I&amp;#39;ve fallen down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014. He is building a video game from scratch and explaining it all as he goes along. 
 
 Casey is a professional video game and game engine, creator. He has been doing it for over 30 years. His approach to development feels a little bit like it&amp;#39;s from the 1970s. Yet, it resonates with many smart people who are learning how to truly build things and understand fundamentals from Casey.  

 Casey has a lesson about learning and teaching for us all.
