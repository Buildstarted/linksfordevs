      <title>Installing a Network Rack in My House</title>
      <link>https://broderic.blog/post/new-network-rack/</link>
      <description>After about a month of work I’ve finally finished installing my new network, all contained in an actual network rack. If you want to see what my network was like before this, here is the post
Here is a quick before and after:
(Router and modem are upstairs. I have cable that runs directly to the switch here.)
(I’ve moved the router down here, while the modem stays upstairs, since that is where the source is.</description>

Not only does it provide an opportunity for outsized returns (if you’re making good choices) but also, compared to being LP in the early-stage Venture Fund it often allows you to have a direct line to founders, which tends to be awesome, and an opportunity to contribute to business success.&amp;#160; […]</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-R1&amp;#39;s strong zero-shot performance on agentic tasks</title>
      <link>http://krasserm.github.io/2025/02/05/deepseek-r1-agent/</link>
      <description>I ran a quick experiment investigating how DeepSeek-R1 performs on agentic tasks, despite not supporting tool use natively, and I was quite impressed by preliminary results. This experiment runs DeepSeek-R1 in a single-agent setup, where the model not only plans the actions but also formulates the actions as executable Python code. On a subset1 of the GAIA validation split, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 12.5% absolute, from 53.1% to 65.6% correct, and other models by an even larger margin:</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI</link>
      <description>This is a general audience deep dive into the Large Language Model (LLM) AI technology that powers ChatGPT and related products. It is covers the full training stack of how the models are developed, along with mental models of how to think about their &amp;quot;psychology&amp;quot;, and how to get the best use them in practical applications. I have one &amp;quot;Intro to LLMs&amp;quot; video already from ~year ago, but that is just a re-recording of a random talk, so I wanted to loop around and do a lot more comprehensive version.

Instructor
Andrej was a founding member at OpenAI (2015) and then Sr. Director of AI at Tesla (2017-2022), and is now a founder at Eureka Labs, which is building an AI-native school. His goal in this video is to raise knowledge and understanding of the state of the art in AI, and empower people to effectively use the latest and greatest in their work.

      <description>Ah, Zig. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A “new” (reading: appeared a couple years ago,
already — yes, already), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design
to solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged
unions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C
successor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there —
even Rust! — allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather
than — quoting from the Zig mantra — your language knowledge. I think I need to put the full mantra
because I will reuse it through this article:</description>

      <description>Remember when dealing with many-to-many relationships in Entity Framework felt like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions? You needed an extra join entity and sometimes a sprinkle of luck to get it all working. EF Core has come to the rescue, making many-to-many relationships as easy as pie (or a fully assembled bookshelf) and giving you improved configurations that put you in the driver&amp;#39;s seat.</description>
