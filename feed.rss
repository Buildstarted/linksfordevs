      <title>Goodbye NancyFX, Hello F#!</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2020-06-16-goodbye-nancyfx-hello-fsharp/</link>
      <description>As some of you may already know, NancyFX has been archived 11 years after its first commit.  You can read the announcement here for further information but I will never forget what I learnt from this codebase, the community around it and most especially the people involved with it.  I am very proud and honoured to have been involved with it and a massive thank you to Andreas Håkansson for teaching me plenty via the 1:1 Skype calls we had in the early days.  As many of you also know I created Carter which in my mind was Nancy v2 but sat on top of ASP.NET Core with the same approaches as Nancy, offering many things a web framework should have.  The usage of Carter has steadily increased which is good to know people value similar things we achieved with Nancy.  However, paradoxically I have had a feeling brewing for sometime that this effort is almost futile.</description>

      <title>Looking Back at Postgres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01973</link>
      <description>This is a recollection of the UC Berkeley Postgres project, which was led by
Mike Stonebraker from the mid-1980's to the mid-1990's. The article was
solicited for Stonebraker's Turing Award book, as one of many
personal/historical recollections. As a result it focuses on Stonebraker's
design ideas and leadership. But Stonebraker was never a coder, and he stayed
out of the way of his development team. The Postgres codebase was the work of a
team of brilliant students and the occasional university "staff programmers"
who had little more experience (and only slightly more compensation) than the
students. I was lucky to join that team as a student during the latter years of
the project. I got helpful input on this writeup from some of the more senior
students on the project, but any errors or omissions are mine. If you spot any
such, please contact me and I will try to fix them.</description>

You can create bots with the Bot Framework SDK which is available for several programming languages. And now, you can use the Bot Framework Composer tool to visually create bots.</description>
