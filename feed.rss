      <title>Where Team Topologies Goes Wrong</title>
      <link>https://www.rheinnecker.de/blog/team-topologies.html</link>
      <description>Gartner places platform engineering almost at
                the peak of inflated expectations in their Hype Cycle for Software Engineering 2023. Senior architects
                and CTOs from companies big and small are touring conferences and meetups to evangelize how awesome
                their new internal development platform is.
                The new mantra is, &amp;#39;DevOps is dead; long live platform engineering.&amp;#39; What caused this
                trend, and why is it so successful, at least in its catchiness? Most talks and introductions about
                platform engineering base all of their arguments on the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and
                Manuel Pais, published in 2019. According to Book Authority[1], this
                book is ranked among the &amp;#39;Best Product Management Books of All Time.&amp;#39; and is widely used by organizations
                worldwide to transform the way they work. By understanding and implementing these team topologies
                effectively, the authors&amp;#39; premise is that organizations can foster collaboration, reduce complexity,
                and accelerate innovation in their software delivery processes.</description>

      <title>Empowering Your Staff Doesn’t Work. Here’s What Does. – Klaus Breyer</title>
      <link>https://www.v01.io/posts/2024-empowering-staff-doesnt-work/</link>
      <description>There was a time when I managed some individuals who weren’t particularly independent. They were talented, no doubt, but hesitant to take action without my input. My solution? Empower them. Or so I thought.
I’d say things like, You’re empowered! Make the call! Take charge! But it never worked the way I hoped. They’d start a task, get partway through, and then ask for clarification—or worse, look for my approval. Frustrated, I found myself micromanaging to ensure things were done correctly. The cycle repeated endlessly: empowering them in words, controlling them in actions.</description>

Learn how I scaled a transactional outbox pattern to handle over 2 billion messages per day using C# and parallel processing. I&amp;#39;ll show you the exact code implementation using Parallel.ForEachAsync for efficient message processing, and break down the architecture that makes it possible. Perfect for developers dealing with high-throughput distributed systems.

Hello, everybody. I&amp;#39;m Nick, and in this video, I will talk about a performance issue that Entity Framework core has with await async in some use cases, which can make the sync version perform faster than the async version.

      <title>Hetzner raises prices while significantly lowering bandwidth (US)</title>
      <link>https://adriano.fyi/posts/hetzner-raises-prices-while-significantly-lowering-bandwidth-in-us/</link>
      <description>Hetzner raises prices This morning I received an email from Hetzner stating that they are raising prices in the US while significantly reducing bandwidth.
The largest price percentage increase is 27.52% for CPX21 servers, and the smallest is 4.17% for CX3+ servers.
Bandwidth allotments are decreasing on average, across all products, 88.19% from previous allotments.
I’ve been a big fan of Hetzner. Unfortunately they’ve made a feeble attempt to dress this change up in the name of “fairness”.
