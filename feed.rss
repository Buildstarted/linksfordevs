      <title>Writing a curriculum vitæ</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/cv/</link>
      <description>I have been giving a lot of feedback about how to write a better
curriculum vitæ (CV) recently. This post is a way of structuring
and disseminating my thoughts on this matter. As a start, let me briefly
delineate what this post is not about: I am not discussing how to
write a resume. A resume is typically only a single page long and
should provide all information pertinent to a very specific job. A CV,
by contrast, can be any length and usually contains all details
pertinent to your professional life.</description>

      <title>Reviews of distributed filesystems | Regressionist</title>
      <link>http://www.regressionist.com/2020/06/20/reviews-of-distributed-filesystems/</link>
      <description>I have a lot of data to work with, and I want to do it with just my mismatched bunch of servers, desktops, SSDs, and spinning disks. My equipment is old, so I want a filesystem that is robust not only to the failure of any drive, but also to the failure of any one machine. My preference is to build a hyper-converged system, where each machine hosts data in addition to working on compute jobs. Following are reviews I found on the main open-source distributed filesystems out there:</description>

      <description>The song draws inspiration from an incident on March 18th, 2016 involving a house in North Carolina Cole had rented to use as a studio, called the “Sheltuh.” The house was raided by SWAT team members after complaints from neighbors who assumed the house was being used to produce and sell drugs. To the neighbors' surprise, no drugs were found in the “Sheltuh,” just a recording studio in the basement.</description>

      <title>Wireless is a trap - LessWrong 2.0</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8hxvfZiqH24oqyr6y/wireless-is-a-trap</link>
      <description>I used to be an anti-wire crusader. I hated the clutter of cables, and my
tendency to unconsciously chew on them if they got anywhere near my face. But
running into bug after tricky wireless bug—mostly while trying to make my video
calls work better—I’ve apostasized. The more I’ve learned about wifi, Bluetooth
and related protocols, the more I’m convinced that they’re often worse, on net,
than wires.

For instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet
service provider. That’s understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced
oligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However,
every time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their
connection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the
easiest fix has been to run a cable.

Wifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they “just
work.” But if you investigate, you’ll often find that the wireless link is
operating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent.
Since this degradation is silent, it’s often not obvious that the problem is the
wireless—instead, you’ll probably conclude that it’s your device/software/self.

Over and over again, I’ve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go 
“wow, I had no idea how much better this could be!"

Fig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.
Recently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk’s wireless devices with
wired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and
break my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the
same level of tidiness, with much better reliability, quality and speed. I no
longer have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery,
or spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk. It’s
dramatically reduced my level of device-related agony.

To illustrate the degree of agony I’m</description>

      <title>A little bit of plain Javascript can do a lot</title>
      <link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/19/a-little-bit-of-plain-javascript-can-do-a-lot/</link>
      <description>I’ve never worked as a professional frontend developer, so even though I’ve been writing HTML/CSS/JS for 15 years for little side projects, all of the projects have been pretty small, sometimes I don’t write any Javascript for years in between, and I often don’t quite feel like I know what I’m doing.
Partly because of that, I’ve leaned on libraries a lot! Ten years ago I used to use jQuery, and since maybe 2017 I’ve been using a lot of vue.</description>

      <title>How is NSA breaking so much crypto?</title>
      <link>https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/10/14/how-is-nsa-breaking-so-much-crypto/</link>
      <description>There have been rumors for years that the NSA can decrypt a significant fraction of encrypted Internet traffic. In 2012, James Bamford published an article quoting anonymous former NSA officials stating that the agency had achieved a “computing breakthrough” that gave them “the ability to crack current public encryption.” The Snowden documents also hint at some extraordinary capabilities: they show that NSA has built extensive infrastructure to intercept and decrypt VPN traffic and suggest that the agency can decrypt at least some HTTPS and SSH connections on demand.</description>

      <link>https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/</link>
      <description>I estimated that I had used my mac for approximately 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 48 weeks a year, for 7 years straight, for a total for whopping 16800 hours. I have written the first versions of most of the software components of my startup using this computer. And all this time, this machine worked without a hiccup. It was never repaired, and I never opened the back cover. However, its battery is getting swollen, so it is a good time to upgrade to a newer machine. Before recycling the machine, I decided to open it for once and vacuum the fans to see if it makes a difference. Oh boy, did it make a difference! You can find the fan test in the video if you want to check it out.</description>

      <title>Nate Rose - Innovating on OUR STEM Education</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooF4sxflT6c</link>
      <description>What is an IQ? Why do we take the SATs? How did it end up even being a metric of childhood success? Senior Software Engineer walks through 100 years of modern education and how it has been systematically flawed for underrepresented communities. NSBE Jr. Bay Area takes on this challenge by innovating outside of the parameters of the education system.

My talk challenges the status quo of common core, standardized tests and looks to technologists, innovators and entrepreneurs as a call to action to remodel education for people of color.

      <title>Mark Okhakumhe - Intellectual Property rights in the technology sector</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWj_iCCcKdU</link>
      <description>The slave who made the whiskey, Jack Daniel, was not given recognition until 2016. This recognition was 150 years late. This is not an isolated incident as there are several instances in the past where inventions and ideas by black people were stolen.

So much has changed all over the world, especially in countries where the rights of black people have always been a subject of constant discourse. A 2016 study found that black Americans “apply for patents at nearly half the rate of whites". This shows that a lot still needs to done to protect the intellectual property rights of black people in tech.

In my session, I will address the subject of what intellectual property rights are, how they can be protected and what the black community can do to help facilitate this protection. I will speak on the jurisdictional nature of intellectual property rights and why it is important for black people in tech to apply for triadic or international patents.

      <title>Blackfacts and The Wakanda Technology Platform   Technology By Us For Us About Us</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELmtRSuM7FM</link>
      <description>The subject of 'Inclusion' in the Tech Industry is a hot topic today.

In 1990, when my employer at the time declined to offer to reimburse me for programming classes I was thinking of taking, the only thing I asked them for was to amend my employment agreement to not claim ownership of anything I built, or in other words, not get in my way.

They agreed, and I taught myself to code by reading books and launched a programming career that has now spanned close to three decades.

When I was able to quit that job a couple of years later from revenue from a product I wrote in my basement apartment, I realized the wide open opportunities available in the world of technology, and committed myself to creating technologies to help 'Bring Communities of Color Into the Information Age.'

Today, I have built a technology platform that powers my 23-years-running website Blackfacts.com, designed to provide Black schools, organizations and businesses with content and technology services on a global basis.

This talk will describe and demonstrate some of the components of the platform, called the Wakanda Technology Platform, inspired by a sub-text of the fictional nation of Wakanda, who was able to protect its culture and people because they were in possession of superior technology.
