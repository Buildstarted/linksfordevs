      <link>https://techimadions.com/abstraction/</link>
      <description>A variable is an abstraction.
In maths, it could represent an unknown, a to be calculated entity or a changing quantity. In programming, it could represent a number, a character/string, a function, an object, or the changing state of a part of a system. It's an interface to some hidden logic the details of which are irrelevant to the current context in which it is being used. God knows what behemoth of complexity it contains or how it has been implemented. Probably a complex data structure or some algorithm that you never cared to learn in college. 😉</description>
