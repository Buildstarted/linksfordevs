      <description>How do we put large language models to work? Carl and Richard talk to Vishwas Lele about his work using LLMs with his customers. Vishwas talks about focusing on specific data sets for building LLMs and how size matters - things are simple when the source data is small, but as it grows, you need more complex tools to be able to allow the LLM to perform. Lots of cautionary tales and ideas on how to get great results from these new automation tools!</description>

      <title>traceroute uses UDP by default, not ICMP</title>
      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/traceroute-uses-udp-by-default-not-icmp/</link>
      <description>At least on Linux.
Don’t believe me? Run tcpdump -nn -i &amp;lt;interface&amp;gt; &amp;#39;host example.com&amp;#39; in one shell and traceroute example.com in another. tcpdump will pick up all 3 of {ICMP, UDP, TCP}, and on my machine the pattern is clear:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20:58:47.187086 IP 1.2.3.4.41369 &amp;gt; 93.184.216.34.33434: UDP, length 32 20:58:47.187160 IP 1.2.3.4.39830 &amp;gt; 93.</description>

      <description>As I grew in my journey of learning martial arts, I want to give back and inspire others to do the same. I really do believe in the value of learning how to fight. It&amp;#39;s encouraging to see beginners overcome their fears of getting hit and grow as fighters. I’ve been training in boxing and muay thai for over 2 years and I have witnessed first hand how it&amp;#39;s helped me in my life.</description>

      <description>Nothing slows a developer down than having to attend meetings constantly. It’s counter intuitive to, in the name of agility, demand that developers leave their desks behind to sit and pretend they can predict how much work it will be to complete a feature in a future, possibly very different, environment.</description>

      <title>Who manages compliance for your outsourced compliance specialists?</title>
      <link>https://pifke.org/posts/trinet/</link>
      <description>Starting around 20 years ago, a popular way for shady startups to skirt employment laws was to hire an outsourced “co-employer” or “employer of record.” Employees would receive their offer letter from—and perform services for—one company, but their paychecks would come from another, which was often in a different state. That way, if the employment relationship went sideways, a shell game could be played as to which company the employee actually worked for.</description>

      <title>Testing C# Code with BenchmarkDotNet</title>
      <link>https://www.matthias-jost.ch/testing-csharp-code-with-benchmarkdotnet/</link>
      <description>BenchmarkDotNet is an open-source library that makes it easy for you as a developer to create benchmarks as a console application. The library became quite popular among .NET developers. That has to do mainly with the ease of use and its ability to provide reliable results out of the box. How you write the benchmark scenarios is very similar to unit tests and, therefore, already feels familiar to most developers. The rest is up to the BenchmarkDotNet. It runs the benchmarks. It figures out the number of executions needed to provide steady results. Then, those results are presented in a human-readable form directly in the console. CSV, Markdown and HTML output are in a separate folder.</description>

I want to take a moment to talk about one of the greatest user interface disasters in history: the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy missile cruiser USS Vincennes (CG-49) over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988. All 290 people on board the airliner were killed.

At the time, the disaster was met with puzzlement. The Vincennes was equipped with the then-brand new Aegis Combat System, the world&amp;#39;s most advanced air-defense system. Driven by cutting-edge computer technology, Aegis had been designed to identify, track and shoot down hundreds of Soviet bombers at a time. How could it possibly have erred so badly when faced with a single civilian airliner?

The U.S. Navy&amp;#39;s official report cleared Aegis completely, blaming the ship&amp;#39;s crew instead. But details of how Aegis operated that day came out later that strongly suggest that the shoot-down happened at least in part because of profound flaws in Aegis&amp;#39; user interfaces. 

If you&amp;#39;re unfamiliar with this incident, Wikipedia has a page on it that will give you a good overview (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655). So rather than recap the whole incident, I&amp;#39;d like to focus in on the user interface problems that led the captain and crew of the Vincennes to make such a devastating error.

(This will be a thread, it&amp;#39;s a complicated subject. I&amp;#39;ll keep it as short as I can, I promise.)
