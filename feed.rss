      <title>Alien Dreams: An Emerging Art Scene - ML@B Blog</title>
      <link>https://ml.berkeley.edu/blog/posts/clip-art/</link>
      <description>In January 2021, OpenAI released the weights and code for their CLIP model, and since then various hackers, artists, researchers, and deep learning enthusiasts have figured out novel methods for combining CLIP with various generative models to create beautiful visual art from just a text prompt. In this blog post I document the evolution of this new art scene and share a bunch of cool artwork along the way.</description>

      <description>JSON is the de facto standard for exchanging data on the Internet. It is relatively simple text format inspired by JavaScript.

      <description>What is a blockchain? Why are some people using it? Even as a developer, it took me a few years to understand what a blockchain really is,how it is working from inside out.
