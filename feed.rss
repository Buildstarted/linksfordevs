      <description>Hey folks! Welcome back to the HTMX journey. Today, we’re diving into a bit of web development history and how HTMX is taking us forward... by looking backward. Cue the DeLorean, because we’re heading back to the days when server-driven development was all the rage.</description>

      <title>Snakes in a Pane: Building Snake Entirely Within a tmux Config File</title>
      <link>https://willhbr.net/2025/03/20/snakes-in-a-pane/</link>
      <description>Honestly I’d stop if I could, but I just get carried away. After making a compiler for tmux, then solving sudoku, then playing video I wasn’t planning on making a game. These things just happen to you. Well maybe not to you, but they happen to me. Unlike the video player, this isn’t just rendering Snake inside tmux. The entire game—input, game logic, and rendering—is done using tmux config files. You just load tmux with this config, and you’ll have...</description>

      <title>You should know this before choosing Next.js</title>
      <link>https://eduardoboucas.com/posts/2025-03-25-you-should-know-this-before-choosing-nextjs/</link>
      <description>Picking the technology stack for a project is an important and consequential decision. In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and [governed by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/governance), a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Code » Half-life of Microsoft products is 7 years</title>
      <link>https://shape-of-code.com/2025/03/23/half-life-of-microsoft-products-is-7-years/</link>
      <description>I get a lot of pushback from developers/managers when I tell them that the average application has a relatively short lifetime, i.e., half-life of 4-8 years.  The pushback kicks in when I start citing data, up until then my listeners appear surprised/skeptical.  The fact that source code has a brief and lonely existence is accepted, but telling them about the (one study) evidence that a coding mistake is more likely to disappear because of an unrelated coding change than as a result of fixing a fault report appears to make them feel uncomfortable.</description>

      <title>Nostalgia — bayindirh</title>
      <link>https://blog.bayindirh.io/blog/nostalgia/</link>
      <description>The people I'm following on the internet put me inside a small but vibrant retrocomputing bubble. When this is combined with the synthwave composers I tend to listen lately, I'm being transported to my earlier years on this planet, repeatedly. The fact that I have grown with a Commodore 64, 486 systems, boomboxes and big Hi-Fi racks makes this a rather harsh, but enjoyable ride every time.</description>

      <title>Hartwork Blog · How much security is in long-term support?</title>
      <link>https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/how-much-security-is-in-long-term-support/</link>
      <description>Everyone loves the idea of long-term support
— LTS for short —
where a vendor promises you to provide security updates for a few years:
little friction and strong security.
Does long-term support live up to that dream?
It does not.
What makes me say that?</description>

      <title>Ski itinerary optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.alexandercogneau.com/posts/ski-path-optimization/</link>
      <description>Every year, my wife and I go skiing in the French Alps.
This time, we set our sights on something ambitious: skiing 100 kilometers in a single day. On a typical day, with breaks and a leisurely pace, we cover 40 to 50 kilometers.
So 100 felt like a stretch, but not impossible. The lifts run from roughly 9-17, giving us only eight hours. To make it work, we needed to properly plan for it.</description>
