      <description>Hello, guys &amp;#128526;, in this article, I will be writing about how to deploy a simple DotNet API to Railway using MongoDB as a data store. Railway is a platform that allows you to seamlessly deploy a web application to a server. It currently offers two methods of deployment:- From the Website (via GitHub integration) From a CLI ( Command Line Interface ) application For the purpose of this article, I would focus on using the CLI tool to deploy my web API.

      <title>Rethinking Control Flow</title>
      <link>https://stuff.kyleperik.com/blog/rethinking_control_flow.html</link>
      <description>Control Flow is a term used when describing the path of program
execution. While it is necessary, I hope from the definition it&amp;#39;s
clear that control flow should be de-emphasized in declarative
programming. Yet, I believe micromanaging control flow
still plays an active role in even the most functional programs
today.</description>

      <title>Truly Paranoid Software Updates</title>
      <link>https://blog.daviddworken.com/posts/truly-paranoid-updates/</link>
      <description>What does it mean to support “secure” updates? Nowadays, supply chain attacks are at the forefront of everyone’s mind, so I think it is worth delving into what it really means to make software updates secure.
The simplest version of software updates is just downloading the updated software version from the vendor, and executing it. For example, one can just download a binary from http://vendor.example/updated-binary.
Warning
But this update is happening over http://?</description>

      <title>Turning a boring file move into a privilege escalation on Mac</title>
      <link>https://pwn.win/2023/10/28/file-move-privesc-mac.html</link>
      <description>While poking around Parallels Desktop I found a script which is invoked by a setuid-root binary, which has the following snippet: local prl_dir=&amp;quot;${usr_home}/Library/Parallels&amp;quot; if [ -e &amp;quot;$prl_dir&amp;quot; -a ! -d &amp;quot;$prl_dir&amp;quot; ]; then log warning &amp;quot;&amp;#39;${prl_dir}&amp;#39; is not a directory. Renaming it.&amp;quot; mv -f &amp;quot;$prl_dir&amp;quot;{,~} continue fi Here ${usr_home} represents the home directory of the user for which Parallels Desktop is installed. The code says if ~/Library/Parallels exists and is not a directory then move it to ~/Library/Parallels~, presumably to back it up before creating this path as a directory.</description>

      <title>Vertette&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://vertette.github.io/post/funfactoruplink</link>
      <description>Remember family computers? Before we had tablets, middle class families would buy overpriced computers from dodgy computer stores that the whole family got to share. As they were mostly used by children and adults who didn&amp;#39;t have the slightest understanding of technology, it didn&amp;#39;t take long for the family computer to down to a crawl, plagued by dodgy Kazaa downloads and suspicious Internet Explorer toolbars. Between a lack of money to buy a better computer, no easy way to buy digital games in Europe for the longest time and no nearby stores that sold computer games, it took until my brother moved out of the home before I really started getting into PC gaming.</description>
