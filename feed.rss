      <title>Cramming &amp;#39;Papers, Please&amp;#39; Onto Phones</title>
      <link>https://dukope.com/devlogs/papers-please/mobile/</link>
      <description>I created Papers, Please in 2013 specifically for desktop computers with mouse control. Now, here, in 2022, desktop computers no longer exist and all computing is done via handheld mobile telephone. Time to update this dinosaur.
These thousands of words and megabytes of images will cover some bits of porting the game from big desktop to little phone. As a winking throwback to days past, this is a big dump of text and inline img tags instead of exciting splashes of quick-cut video.</description>

      <description>The design profession has a critical job and that is to transition itself. We need to adopt a radical worldview that takes into account current world trends that disrupt our professional and personal lives in ways we cannot fully grasp just yet.</description>

      <title>Weird Expressions and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://blog.mgattozzi.dev/weird-expressions-and-where-to-find-them/</link>
      <description>This is a written transcript of my RustConf 2022 talk using rustc at commit 6491eb1e6c9fac20faad11e5da16db3185b2410d


Introduction

My name is Michael Gattozzi and today I want to bring you on a journey from &amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;No way that works&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Wait why does that work?!&amp;quot; and then true understanding and acceptance.</description>

      <title>Running your CI builds without the server</title>
      <link>https://blog.djinn-ci.com/showcase/2022/08/06/running-your-ci-builds-without-the-server/</link>
      <description>Perhaps the one feature that sets Djinn CI out from other CI platforms is the
fact that is has an offline runner.
The offline runner allows for CI builds to be run without having to send them
to the server. There are some limitations around this, of course, but it
provides a useful mechanism for sanity checking build manifests, testing custom
images, and for building software without the need for a CI server.</description>

      <description>This means that if you were always poor — you function differently than those with abundant resources. But if you were rich before and then suddenly plummeted to poverty — your brain goes into a full-on scarcity mindset.</description>

      <title>Hosting a Minecraft server without extra hardware</title>
      <link>https://siraben.dev/2022/08/01/tailscale-iptables.html</link>
      <description>The problem I want to play Minecraft with my friends, and I already have a server exposed to the internet. However, my server is severely underpowered and is unable to run a Minecraft server instance. On the other hand, I have a spare beefy laptop that can easily handle the load, but port-forwarding is not possible. Both the server and the laptop are on my Tailscale network. Could I somehow leverage all of this to spin up a Minecraft server with a public IP? The answer was yes—and I was surprised at how easy it all was. As a plus, the server is very playable and the latency was better than trying out random “free hosting” services.</description>

      <title>The bizzare world of parsing dates in Spark 2</title>
      <link>https://blog.jonas.earth/posts/bizzare-dates-in-spark2/</link>
      <description>Note: I originally tweeted this into the void
Dates are famously one of the easiest things in software engineering, but Spark 2 added a cherry on the top.
The numbers are off… but just slightly. When I first stumbled across this it wasn’t one of the bugs that just scream in your face - it was subtle. Something didn’t add up, and after a lot of digging it became clear that things didn’t add up around the year mark - repeatedly, but weirdly enough sometimes affecting a few days in December, and in other cases affecting a few days in January.</description>

      <title>Mediator Pattern - CQRS with MediatR</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/064ca62a-b384-45da-9212-4c3840e5ba9c</link>
      <description>The famous mediator pattern. Used so often especially in combination with CQRS.
If you know how to order food at a restaurant then you already halfway there to understand how the CQRS pattern works. I promised it is not that difficult ;)
In this article I will show how the mediator pattern itself works, what CQRS is and its advantages. For that we will write a small application, which demonstrates how to use the pattern and what we gain from using it.
