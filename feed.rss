      <title>Earning $800 / Month With Spotify — Steve Benjamins</title>
      <link>https://www.stevebenjamins.com/blog/music-in-the-age-of-algorithms-47syg</link>
      <description>I'm making over $800 per month with my music— almost exclusively through Spotify. This up from  $400 per month  last year.     I don't tour, I don't sell merch and I'm not on a major label. I'm just a small indie artist making music in my evenings— and Spotify is making that possible.</description>

      <title>Understanding SSIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13846</link>
      <description>The use of the structural similarity index (SSIM) is widespread. For almost
two decades, it has played a major role in image quality assessment in many
different research disciplines. Clearly, its merits are indisputable in the
research community. However, little deep scrutiny of this index has been
performed. Contrary to popular belief, there are some interesting properties of
SSIM that merit such scrutiny. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical
factors of SSIM and show that it can generate results, in both synthetic and
realistic use cases, that are unexpected, sometimes undefined, and
nonintuitive. As a consequence, assessing image quality based on SSIM can lead
to incorrect conclusions and using SSIM as a loss function for deep learning
can guide neural network training in the wrong direction.</description>

      <title>Mona Lisa in Real Life? Depixelizing Doom Guy? The "Upscaling" AI: PULSE</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSoHaO3YqH8</link>
      <description>I mean I call it reverse enhancing since it is really taking the other way to enhance... It works really well though! And to be fair, nothing could really be enhanced if there are already information that is inadequate. You will need to generate new facial information, and this AI could be the best way to do it! Just need more training like usual though.

      <title>How to embed JavaScript components in C# built Uno WebAssembly Web Applications - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/how-to-embed-javascript-components-in-c-built-uno-webassembly-web-applications/</link>
      <description>We often get asked if it is possible to integrate Uno-WASM Web Applications with existing JavaScript components. Since WebAssembly code is running inside browser’s JavaScript context, the answer is “Yes” and it is actually quite simple to do it. In this article we will explore how you can create interoperability (interop) between Uno-WASM managed code and JavaScript context of an application. The two sample apps with code we provide will help you understand how to use the integration in actual application code. For the purpose of the examples we will create an application using a well known date/time picker control called Flartpickr as well as syntax visualizer called PrismJS. In the end you will generate applications looking like this:   Leveraging the Uno.WASM Bootstrapper At the heart of Uno-WASM, there’s a package called Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap (Uno Bootstrapper) project. It contains the tooling required to build, package, deploy, run and debug a .NET project in a web browser using WebAssembly. HTML5 Is a Rich and Powerful Platform Uno Platform fully embraces HTML5 as its display backend when targeting WebAssembly (WASM). As a result, creating hybrid HTML/Uno-WASM apps becomes easy. That also means application can reuse existing JavaScript components directly, often unchanged. Access …</description>

      <title>Fix Your Timestep! | Gaffer On Games</title>
      <link>https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/</link>
      <description>Introduction Hi, I’m Glenn Fiedler and welcome to Game Physics.
In the previous article we discussed how to integrate the equations of motion using a numerical integrator. Integration sounds complicated, but it’s just a way to advance the your physics simulation forward by some small amount of time called “delta time” (or dt for short).
But how to choose this delta time value? This may seem like a trivial subject but in fact there are many different ways to do it, each with their own strengths and weaknesses - so read on!</description>

      <description>Apple’s strategy for years has been to trade desktop power for cross-device feature parity. As expected, macOS Big Sur continues this trend, emphasizing a consistent user interface across devices, and focusing on cross-device development technologies like SwiftUI and Catalyst.</description>

      <link>https://arenzana.org/2020/06/emacs-server-why-and-why-not/</link>
      <description>I tend to use tmux as my multiplexer and I run a session on my laptop as soon as I start working. This session will only die when the machine goes down for a reboot or when shutting it down. The advantage of running tmux is (besides being able to upgrade iTerm without losing all my sessions) is that it keeps my brain trained to work on a remote box (I used to work in operations, being a sysadmin truly does something to your brain). Inside this tmux session, I run Emacs by typing e, which is an alias on my ~/.zshrc as follows:</description>

      <title>Industry and workers</title>
      <link>https://smaslennikov.com/posts/industry-and-workers/</link>
      <description>In a previous post I mentioned the Industrial Revolution as a good early example of exploitation of workers for the benefit of industry owners. Naturally, this wasn’t the first or only time this happened1. The Industrial Revolution, however, is specifically an example of technologies driving out the workers, while their marketing suggested otherwise. The hope was that technological improvements were supposed to make life easier, to decrease manufacturing costs, therefore increasing resources for the people. Of course, that never happened: the income flowed to the owners and founders, then due to competition and product pricing adjustments - into the ether, though we can speculate that theoretically the better price point did help the people in the end. Just one example is society in the Russian Empire, which was basically split into two classes: landowners and peasants. Moving up from peasantry was practically impossible. For those interested in the subject, I strongly recommend Lev Tolstoy’s works: namely, Anna Karenina, but also War and Peace. Both were written in mid to late 19th century and are not only a pleasure to read, but portray the sequence of events leading up to our revolutions. ↩</description>

      <title>What's in a Linux executable?</title>
      <link>https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2020/whats-in-a-linux-executable/</link>
      <description>Executables have been fascinating to me ever since I discovered, as a kid, that they were just files. If you renamed a .exe to something else, you could open it in notepad! And if you renamed something else to a .exe, you'd get a neat error dialog.
Clearly, something was different about these files. Seen from notepad, they were mostly gibberish, but there had to be order in that chaos. 12-year-old me knew that, although he didn't quite know how or where to dig to make sense of it all.</description>
