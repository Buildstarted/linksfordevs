      <description>Tab mayhem and windows inflation  How many browser tabs are open on your browser right now? Too many to count? Let me guess: Rows and rows of tabs belonging to different research tasks that you want to pick up later. The occasional tab on social network. That store you still have a cart open with that thing you maybe want to buy. Some are still relevant but many are not.</description>

The next day (after having the tank fixed), I purchased a water leak sensor, added it to Home Assistant in under 2 minutes, and was able to get push notifications of future detected leaks.</description>

      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/the-simple-joy-of-learning-to-play-piano/</link>
      <description>Back in January, I started to teach myself how to play piano. I&amp;#39;d played before when I was a kid — like many people do — but I was never very good and it didn&amp;#39;t stick once I&amp;#39;d stopped taking lessons. I&amp;#39;d had a keyboard for years, stowed away at my parent&amp;#39;s place, but I&amp;#39;d rarely ever used it. I had occasionally tried to pick up piano over the years, but just like when I was a kid: it didn&amp;#39;t stick.</description>

      <title>Modern Python performance considerations</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/893686/8978976335696804/</link>
      <description>There is a lot of work going on right now on speeding up Python; Kevin
Modzelewski gave a presentation at 
PyCon 2022 on some of that
work.  Much of it has implications for Python programmers in terms of how
to best take advantage of these optimizations in their code.  He gave an
overview of some of the projects, the kinds of optimizations being worked
on, and provided some benchmarks to give a general idea of how much faster
various Python implementations are getting—and which operations are most affected.</description>
