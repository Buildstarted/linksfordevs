So when it was announced in October that they were shutting down AIM after 20 years, I felt a wave of nostalgia for the messaging app of my youth.</description>

      <title>Prime+Probe 1, JavaScript 0: Overcoming Browser-based Side-Channel Defenses</title>
      <link>https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/p/PP0</link>
      <description>Abstract The “eternal war in cache” has reached browsers, with multiple cache-based side-channel attacks and countermeasures being suggested. A common approach for countermeasures is to disable or restrict javaScript features deemed essential for carrying out attacks. A recent proposal following this approach is Chrome Zero, a browser add-on that intercepts and changes the semantics of some JavaScript features, while claiming minimal impact on user experience.</description>

      <description>It shouldn’t have to be this way, but the burden of protecting your privacy as you browse the web is your own. I do what I can in my research and consulting to advocate for systemic change in design and policy to reduce the burden on the individual user; but that kind of change is slow to fruit. Meanwhile, there are tools that you, the individual, can use to partially protect yourself against the forces of surveillance capitalism and other institutional privacy threats. I will share five that I use myself.</description>
