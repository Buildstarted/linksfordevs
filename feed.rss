      <description>If you didn&amp;#39;t know, I&amp;#39;ve been writing a book (called Real-World Cryptography) for almost 2 years now on applied cryptography, why would I do this? I answered this in a post here.

      <link>http://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/vinyl-boot/</link>
      <description>Most PCs tend to boot from a primary media storage, be it a hard disk drive, or a solid-state drive, perhaps from a network, or – if all else fails – the USB stick or the boot DVD comes to the rescue… Fun, eh? Boring! Why don’t we try to boot from a record player for a change?</description>

      <description>Linux on the iPad isn&amp;#39;t a reality yet, at least not like on a desktop platform. With hardware becoming more and more powerful every year, obsolete iPadsshould be allowed to continue to serve a purpose. Obsolete iPads could be affordable personal computers and useful for project builds. We believe Linux is the key to bring new life to these devices.</description>
