      <title>Maintaining control of our data with personal databases</title>
      <link>https://blog.marcua.net/2025/01/05/maintaining-control-of-our-data-with-personal-databases.html</link>
      <description>Relational databases are in their sixth decade, and the database community is understandably celebrating and reflecting on its accomplishments. In two wonderful pieces, Donald Chamberlin shared his perspective on the past half-century, and Eugene Wu shared thoughts on where we can go from here. At a time of reflection on relational database management systems as a largely solved problem, I’m struck by a painful contrast: databases are more powerful than they’ve ever been, but the average person’s relationship with their data is in the worst state it’s ever been.</description>

      <description>Document-based applications are software systems that are centred around creating and editing documents. What constitutes a “document” depends on the application. For a text editor, it may be as simple as a single text file. A CAD application most likely has its own file format to efficiently contain all the</description>

      <description>In today&amp;#39;s hyper-connected world, where everything from your smartphone to your coffee machine can be online, understanding networking is no longer just for IT pros. At the heart of all this connectivity lies IP addressing and subnetting—the unsung heroes of the digital age. These concepts are the foundation of how devices communicate and share data seamlessly across networks, ensuring everything works. But how does it all happen? Let&amp;#39;s break it down.</description>

      <title>The day I taught AI to read code like a Senior Developer</title>

As timeout errors flooded my terminal, something clicked. We’d been teaching AI to read code like a fresh bootcamp grad, not a senior developer. Here’s what I mean.</description>

      <title>Docker on MacOS is still slow?</title>
      <link>https://www.paolomainardi.com/posts/docker-performance-macos-2025/</link>
      <description>TLDR Link to heading Two years after my first analysis of Docker performance on MacOS, things have improved significantly. VirtIOFS is now much faster (bind mounts are only 3x slower instead of 5-6x), and we have new solutions in the ecosystem. Lima (open-source) performs well and sometimes better than Docker Desktop, while Docker’s new file synchronization feature offers impressive speed improvements (59% faster) but requires a paid subscription. For the most stable performance, the hybrid approach (combining bind mounts with volumes) remains the best practice. Choose your setup based on your needs:</description>
