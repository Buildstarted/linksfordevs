      <title>Hamblingreen&amp;#39;s Pinephone Setup</title>
      <link>https://hamblingreen.gitlab.io/2022/03/02/my-pinephone-setup.html</link>
      <description>The Pine64 Pinephone[0] is my first Linux device. It sounds crazy, but I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to use linux for quite a while. I made an effort to switch to FOSS on android, but due to the fact that my phone&amp;#39;s bootloader was locked, I couldn&amp;#39;t install LineageOS. All this time I was aware that the core of my phone, it&amp;#39;s kernel, was closed source and probably out-of-date. This nudged me to research Linux. The more I looked, the more there was to like. At first I tried installing Arch linux on WSL (Windows Subsystem For Linux) but this was unsuccessful. I wanted a truly native Linux device, but was unable to afford my own computer. This is where the Pinephone comes in, where I could kill two birds with one stone. Not only would I get a new phone of which I had complete control, but I&amp;#39;d also have a native Linux device. Now, I use my Pinephone as more than a phone. It&amp;#39;s my communicator, my general purpouse computer and my development device. Calling it a phone just doesn&amp;#39;t do this device justice. It&amp;#39;s a desktop computer. One that happens to fit in your pocket. Keeping all this in mind, my usecase is relatively light. I need it for schoolwork, coding and testing programs, web browsing, communication, and video/audio streaming. The reason it can remain as my sole device is because I don&amp;#39;t need to run heavy software like Autodesk. I need to do very basic tasks, and the Pinephone fulfills them and more.</description>

Wouldn’t it be cool to remotely program a Golang app on a Raspberry Pi? In this post, I write how to do that if you are using Atom.
TL;DR;


Setup a Raspberry Pi Device
Setup Golang on that Device
Install remote-ftp on your Machine
Connect from your Atom
Write a Golang Application

      <description>There’s a lot of arguments for and against monorepos. Done right, I believe monorepos will help you move with urgency and focus as your engineering organization grows. That doesn’t mean it’s easy! I’ve also seen monorepos turn into monoliths that block teams from getting anything out in a timely manner.</description>
