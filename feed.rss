“Is it a $550 click?” I asked.

He clicked it a few more times. “It’s not *not* a $550 click.”</description>

      <title>Who do we spend time with across our lifetime?</title>
      <link>https://ourworldindata.org/time-with-others-lifetime</link>
      <description>Who we spend time with evolves across our lifetimes. In adolescence we spend the most time with our parents, siblings, and friends; as we enter adulthood we spend more time with our co-workers, partners, and children; and in our later years we spend an increasing amount of time alone. But this doesn’t necessarily mean we are lonely; rather, it helps reveal the complex nature of social connections and their impact on our well-being.</description>

      <title>CS 6120: The Self-Guided Course</title>
      <link>https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/</link>
      <description>CS 6120 is a PhD-level Cornell CS course by Adrian Sampson on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class.</description>

      <title>Parsing ETL traces yourself, part 3: The TraceProcessor | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201211-00/?p=104539</link>
      <description>When you’re processing ETL traces, you sometimes need to bring out the big guns. And in this case, the big guns are called .NET TraceProcessing. This is the same class used by the Windows Performance Analyzer to power its data analysis,&amp;#185; so you are getting exactly what WPA has.&amp;#178; The basic idea behind using the Trace&amp;#173;Processor is to operate in four steps: Create a Trace&amp;#173;Processor that parses your ETL file.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on CentOS Stream</title>
      <link>https://jperrin.org/blog/thoughts-on-stream/</link>
      <description>I’m excited to see the CentOS project and Red Hat work together and collaborate around CentOS Stream, and I’d like to explain why I think this is a good move. I’ve been a member of the CentOS project for the last 16 years, and in that time I’ve had countless conversations with developers who were targeting enterprise deployments, but who wanted to push things just a little beyond what was currently available. In my early days with the project it was “I just need this new feature from PHP” or “I need this one option enabled in postfix”. This was so common it spawned an entire cottage industry of 3rd party repositories like Elrepo, IUS, nux-desktop, and even our own CentOSPlus. Often these were features Red Hat would include in a future version of RHEL, but the timing and communication around these features was a mystery. Red Hat never announced release dates or upcoming features and for many developers, even for those internal to Red Hat this was a PROBLEM.</description>
