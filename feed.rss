      <title>.NET Rocks! Understand Web Apps using Fiddler with Sam Basu and Rosen Vladimirov</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1840</link>
      <description>Do you know what your web app is up to? Carl and Richard talk to Sam Basu and Rosen Vladimirov about the latest versions of Fiddler. The original Fiddler for Windows is a free tool, but the Progress team has written all new products in the Fiddler space that are cross-platform and designed to work with different groups of people. Fiddler is for developers, first and foremost, letting you see the messages passing between the browser (or other clients) and the server in HTTP and HTTPS. With the new products, you can also connect to SignalR and gRPC data! Then there are tools for tech support and even embedding capabilities into your applications.</description>

      <title>Startup Attempts and Failures, 2021 – 2023</title>
      <link>https://nathanleclaire.com/blog/2023/04/05/startup-attempts-and-failures-2021-2023/</link>
      <description>In 2021, I quit my job at Honeycomb to set out on my own and try to build a company. At first, I wasn’t sure the exact model I’d follow, and had a (perhaps too lofty) aspiration that maybe I’d have a hybrid model, doing a bit of consulting, a bit of real estate, and a bit of product/SaaS/4-hour-workweek livin’ the dream. And, of course, if I happened to hit on something big, I could go raise venture and pursue that.</description>

      <title>Remaining Relevant Over Four Decades</title>
      <link>https://thecodist.com/how-i-stayed-relevant-over-four-decades/</link>
      <description>Four decades is a long time to be a programmer. I started in 1981 and retired in 2021. During that time, almost everything changed, and I had to change with it. While my situation may be different than starting today, much of what I learned over time can still be</description>

      <title>Tim K&amp;#228;chele: Naming is everything</title>
      <link>https://blog.timkaechele.me/2023/04/05/naming-is-everything.html</link>
      <description>Naming things is important, not only when programming, but also in the real world.
How you name something shapes how you think about it, and by extension limits it.
A well known real world instance where you can experience the power of names first hand is law making.
Think about it, what sounds better:</description>

      <title>The real &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot; tools for programmers</title>
      <link>https://jamesdunne.dev/posts/must-have-programming-tools/</link>
      <description>Forget programs. The most important productivity tool for programming is your mind. And the next best set of software development tools are ones that take care of you.
It isn’t about Git. Or Docker. Or testing frameworks. These are all useful tools. I use them daily. But they are not the most important software development tools.
Your wellbeing is, in fact, the most important factor in your ability to write good software.</description>
