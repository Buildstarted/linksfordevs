      <title>Automatic factory with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection and Castle DynamicProxy</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2020/09/27/automatic-factory-with-microsoft-extensions-dependencyinjection-and-castle-dynamicproxy/</link>
      <description>Dependency injection: the good and the bad Dependency injection (DI) is a great pattern, which can really help make your code cleaner, more decoupled and more testable. There are many DI libraries, like Autofac, Lamar (StructureMap’s successor), Castle Windsor, etc., but lately I’ve mostly been using the one provided by Microsoft in .NET Core : Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection. It’s not the most full-featured (in fact, it’s pretty bare-bones), but I find it sufficient in most cases.</description>

      <title>If You Don't Understand Quantum Physics, Try This!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usu9xZfabPM</link>
      <description>A simple and clear explanation of all the important features of quantum physics that you need to know. Check out this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos 
I have spent a lot of time thinking about how best to explain quantum physics and this is the result of all my hours of pondering, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. I decided to just explain it as it actually is, rather than rely on analogies. The video explains the quantum wavefunction, particle-wave duality, the measurement problem, the double-slit experiment, superposition, entanglement, quantum tunnelling, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and energy quantisation. Let me know if it was helpful! Cheers Dx

Further reading
For a more detailed introduction to quantum physics: 'The Quantum Universe' by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw is good.
And a slightly more advanced but fantastic description of what we do and don't know about quantum physics is the excellent book 'Beyond Weird' by Philip Ball.

Then, when you’re an adult,  the world eats you.&amp;nbsp;   We grow up, and the same dreams become impossible or we stop pursuing them. But why? Was it because our dreams were straight-up stupid?

      <title>Thoughts on Structured Editing: Breaking Away from Syntax</title>
      <link>https://mbuffett.com/posts/structured-editing-syntax/</link>
      <description>I was aimlessly browsing Github and came across sapling, a very early-stage structured editor. It was inspired by this blog post, which talks about structured editing.
Structured editing has had my interest for a while. I’ve put a lot of time and effort into getting really good at text editing, but I’m holding out hope that in 10 years plaintext editing will be outdated. The idea behind structured editing is to edit code instead of text, so instead of “move cursor to next parentheses, delete in parentheses”, you’d have operations like “change function argument”.</description>

      <title>How I keep ads away from me</title>
      <link>https://akhil.me/2020/How-I-keep-ads-away-from-me/</link>
      <description>We live in a world where we are being looked at all the time. I say “looked at” because that kind of sounds less harsh compared to “tracked and surveilled”. The phones and smart devices that we ourselves make sure are with us all the time are always listening to us - even when we are no talking to them. Google and Apple, even Instagram and Tiktok, know where you are all the time even when you are not even using their apps. Google has access to all your emails and can shut you out of your life just because. You cannot escape the Facebook mafia. If you stop using Facebook, they catch you with Instagram. If you don’t use Instagram they will catch you with Whatsapp. If you somehow even escape that. Facebook now owns “Giphy”  the gif search engine that is built in your phone keyboard. Hell, let’s say you don’t even use that they can track you with their integrations in every single website and app that you are using. They have a profile of you even if you never made it and it is more detailed than it would have been if you have provided that data yourself.</description>

      <description>A disgruntled American hotel guest who posted several bad TripAdvisor and other online reviews about a resort in Koh Chang, Thailand has been arrested by the police and spent several days in jail after the hotel filed a police complaint for defamation. In what turned into a case of media mudslinging over the last few days, the resort which initially got a lot of flak defended itself saying that the defamation complaint was the last resort after American posted repeated 'untrue' reviews. According to media reports the whole drama initially started as the guest brought outside alcohol into the hotels</description>

      <title>For Us, Without Us: Addressing Tech's Shortcomings in Creating Equity for Black People [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uoaVYkHA-M</link>
      <description>Many consider technology to be the “great equalizer”, but it’s evident that Black people are not benefiting at the same rates as others. This session will discuss how the forces that limit Black people’s ability to navigate the physical also prevent us from exerting agency via the digital. Together, we’ll discuss the ways that anti-Blackness is replicated in technology, the discrepancies faced by Black communities due to the digital divide, and the changes required for us to have a more equitable future. Because we can never fully benefit if technology continues to be made for us, without us.

      <title>git commit-tree parlor tricks, Part 9: How can I bulk-revert an entire repo to an earlier commit? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200928-00/?p=104302</link>
      <description>Suppose you’ve made a bunch of commits to a branch, and then you decide that you want to roll back the entire repo to an earlier commit. Just pretend the last dozen commits never happened. The branch policy prevents force-pushes, so you will have to make a new commit that effectively reverts a large number of commits.    </description>

      <description>It is hard to believe, but Judge Baraitser on Friday ruled that there will be no closing speeches in the Assange extradition hearing.

      <description>Since I’m lightly employed these days, I enjoy keeping up with the news. In recent weeks, I’ve been blocked by the paywalls
    of the Wall Street Journal, Globe &amp; Mail (closest thing Canada has to a national newspaper), the
    Times/Sunday Times (of London), the Telegraph (also UK), Business Insider, and
    Bloomberg.
    Recently I got a bit of inside info on how these publications think about the economics, and I’m here to explain why they’re
    wrong.</description>
