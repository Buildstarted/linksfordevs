      <description>LLMs can learn from a few example and even &amp;quot;learn&amp;quot; tasks that contradict their pre-training distribution. Wild stuff ahead.</description>

      <title>Sustained Inaction</title>
      <link>https://bonesmoses.org/2024/sustained-inaction/</link>
      <description>I woke up from a dream this morning where someone from my past was being incredibly unfair to me. At some point, I exploded in rage and started to yell about said injustice, and referenced being autistic. This being a dream, the person felt really bad about how they were treating me, and that’s about all I can remember.
It’s very common for my dreams to “prime” me for the rest of the day, so of course I spent the next hour or so pondering my past as a result.</description>

      <title>Building a modular softsynth from scratch (Week 1)</title>
      <link>https://sharphall.org/posts/2024/Aug/19/building-a-modular-softsynth-from-scratch-week-1.html</link>
      <description>To kick off my time at the Recurse Center I decided to build a modular softsynth in Rust to expand my knowledge of Rust and DSP, as well as build something I and others could use to make music. I’m inspired by an old modular softsynth I used to use called SpiralSynthModular. Unfortunately, this software is dated and no longer updated, and doesn’t compile easily in a modern environment.</description>

      <title>Startup CTO - Premature Scaling</title>
      <link>https://blog.karliner.net/posts/startup-cto-premature-scaling/</link>
      <description>So, you are a first time CTO in a start-up. You’ve just landed your seed investment, and you and your team are feeling pretty good about yourselves. At last, you have enough money to be able to start the real work of building out your product or service.
Your CEO is completely committed to her vision has a near religious belief in it. And that is as it should be, because it a steadfast vision is necessary to be able to weather all the storms of startup life.</description>

      <title>Finding a ‘harmless’ Pi-hole vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://www.kiyell.com/The-Harmless-Pihole-Bug/</link>
      <description>In my journey as a bug bounty hunter, one of the things that I do all the time is pentesting web applications without access to the source code. This is known as black-box testing. So when I recently purchased a Raspberry Pi and installed Pi-hole for use in my home network, I started thinking about testing for a change, a piece of open source software I’m using for security flaws.</description>
