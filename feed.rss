      <link>https://ergaster.org/posts/2025/02/28-prosthetics-that-dont-betray/</link>
      <description>Tech takes a central place in our lives. Banking, and administrative tasks are happening more and more online. It&amp;#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to get through life without a computer or a smartphone. They have become external organs necessary to live our life. I believe computers &amp;amp; smartphones have become prosthetics, extensions of people that should unconditionally and entirely belong to them. We must produce devices and products the general public can trust.</description>

      <title>Some thoughts on autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://wonderfall.dev/autoregressive/</link>
      <description>Most generative AI models nowadays are autoregressive. That means they’re following the concept of next token prediction, and the transformer architecture is the current implementation that has been used for years now thanks to its computational efficiency. This is a rather simple concept that’s easy to understand - as long as you aren’t interested in the details - everything can be tokenized and fed into an autoregressive (AR) model. And by everything, I mean everything: text as you’d expect, but also images, videos, 3D models and whatnot.</description>

      <description>Oh, of course you are into &amp;quot;boring&amp;quot; businesses. You skimmed one Peter Thiel blog post or caught half a 20VC podcast and now you are convinced you have cracked the code: “boring markets are where the real money is.” Innovation? Overrated! Just find something no one thinks about, janitorial supply chains, parking meters, dry-cleaning, then slap a SaaS subscription on it.</description>

      <title>Generative AI with Stochastic Differential Equations - IAP 2025</title>
      <link>https://diffusion.csail.mit.edu/</link>
      <description>Diffusion and flow-based models have become the state of the art for generative AI across a wide range of data modalities, including images, videos, shapes, molecules, music, and more! This course aims to build up the mathematical framework underlying these models from first principles. At the end of the class, students will have built a toy image diffusion model from scratch, and along the way, will have gained hands-on experience with the mathematical toolbox of stochastic differential equations that is useful in many other fields. This course is ideal for students who want to develop a principled understanding of the theory and practice of generative AI.</description>

      <description>As part of my work toward an upcoming post about a lost piece of very obscure Mac history that has finally been found, I’ve been playing around with old Apple-branded SCSI hard drives made by Quantum and Conner in the 1990s. What I’m about to describe is already common knowledge in the vintage computing world, but I thought it would be fun to share my take on it anyway.</description>

      <title>Terraform on Autopilot: Building Dynamic, Self-Scaling Infrastructure - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/terraform-on-autopilot-building-dynamic-self-scaling-infrastructure/</link>
      <description>What if your infrastructure could scale itself up when traffic spikes and shrink when demand drops? What if it could self-heal when things break—without you lifting a finger? Sounds futuristic? It’s possible today with Terraform! With dynamic infrastructure, Terraform can: Auto-scale compute resources based on demand. Adjust networking and storage dynamically. Trigger infrastructure changes using event-driven automation.</description>
