      <title>How (some) good corporate engineering blogs are written</title>
      <link>https://danluu.com/corp-eng-blogs/</link>
      <description>I've been comparing notes with people who run corporate engineering blogs and one thing that I think is curious is that it's pretty common for my personal blog to get more traffic than the entire corp eng blog for a company with a nine to ten figure valuation and it's not uncommon for my blog to get an order of magnitude more traffic.</description>

      <description>When you inject events into the cloud, do you care whether they come out in the same order they went in?  If you do, you’ll be
    asking for “FIFO” (rhymes with “Fly, foe!”) (stands for “First In First Out”). Some software has it, some doesn’t.</description>

      <description>What happened was, at re:Invent 2019 I gave a talk entitled
    Moving to Event-Driven Architecture, discussing a list of
    characteristics that distinguish eventing and messaging services.  It was a lot of work pulling the
    material together and I’ve learned a couple of things since then; thus, welcome to the
    Eventing Facets blog series, of which this is the hub. It’s going to
    take a while to fill this out.</description>

      <description>When you fire an event into the cloud, can you be sure it’ll only come out again once?  It turns out that 
    sometimes they come out more often than they go in.  This may or may not be a problem in your
    application. If it is, there are techniques to help work around it.</description>

      <link>https://www.meziantou.net/asp-net-core-json-logger.htm</link>
      <description>ASP.NET Core supports a logging API that works with a variety of built-in and third-party logging providers. The built-in providers allow to log to the console, the debug output or as ETW messages.
In my case I needed to output the messages and their associated data to console as JSON. This means I had to create a custom logger and integrate it in the ASP.NET Core application.
Let's define the structure…</description>

      <description>MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.</description>

      <description>We need your help! Folding@home is joining researchers around the world working to better understand the 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to accelerate the open science effort to develop new life-saving therapies. By downloading Folding@Home, you can donate your unused computational resources to the Folding@home Consortium, where researchers working to advance our understanding of the structures of potential drug targets for 2019-nCoV that could aid in the design of new therapies. The data you help us generate will be quickly and openly disseminated as part of an open science collaboration of multiple laboratories around the world, giving researchers new tools that may unlock new opportunities for developing lifesaving drugs.</description>
