      <title>MongoDB Atlas Vector Search in .NET (full tutorial)</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=LQJJjIjUW6U</link>
      <description>Learn more about MongoDB Atlas Vector Search: https://fnf.dev/4iLtBck

Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt

In this comprehensive tutorial, I demonstrate how to implement semantic search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search in a .NET application. Unlike traditional keyword-based search which looks for specific terms, semantic search understands the meaning behind your queries, providing more intuitive and powerful search capabilities.

I'll walk you through:
- Understanding vector embeddings and how they work
- Setting up MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
- Generating embeddings from your content using local LLMs
- Implementing vector search queries in .NET
- Pre-filtering search results for better performance

Learn how MongoDB can function as both your primary document database and vector database, eliminating the need for separate specialized systems. This tutorial includes complete code examples for generating embeddings, creating vector search indexes, and implementing semantic search in a movie database application.

Whether you're building AI-powered search, recommendation systems, or just want to improve your application's search experience, this tutorial will show you how to leverage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for powerful semantic understanding.

      <title>What If We Could Rebuild Kafka From Scratch?</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/what-if-we-could-rebuild-kafka-from-scratch/</link>
      <description>
The last few days I spent some time digging into the recently announced KIP-1150 ("Diskless Kafka"), as well AutoMQ’s Kafka fork, tightly integrating Apache Kafka and object storage, such as S3. Following the example set by WarpStream, these projects aim to substantially improve the experience of using Kafka in cloud environments, providing better elasticity, drastically reducing cost, and paving the way towards native lakehouse integration.


This got me thinking, if we were to start all over and develop a durable cloud-native event log from scratch—​Kafka.next if you will—​which traits and characteristics would be desirable for this to have? Separating storage and compute and object store support would be table stakes, but what else should be there? Having used Kafka for many years for building event-driven applications as well as for running realtime ETL and change data capture pipelines, here’s my personal wishlist:
