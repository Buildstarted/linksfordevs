      <title>Welcome to Peter&amp;#39;s DevLog - Wrapping C libraries in Nim</title>
      <link>https://peterme.net/wrapping-c-libraries-in-nim.html</link>
      <description>As we discovered in my last article, Nim will by default generate C code and then call on a C compiler to actually produce a binary. This might seem like an odd choice, especially in the age of LLVM. However it’s actually not uncommon for languages to compile or transpile into another language. Initially the choice to not use LLVM was simply because it wasn’t as mature back when Nim was created. Though going through C has some quite substantial benefits. For example you’re able to run Nim anywhere you can run C, which means you can run it pretty much anywhere. From the tiniest micro-controllers, to mobile apps, to normal desktop/server targets1. There is another benefit though which this article focuses on, namely the ability to super easily interface with C libraries or programs. This is what’s called a foreign function interface or FFI and just means we’re calling functions from another language, in this case Nim from C, or C from Nim. Of course the Nim language has quite a few extra features and systems compared to C, so when using a library written in C we often want to do a little bit of translation work in order to make the interface a bit more familiar to Nim users2. Especially when it comes to things like memory management, and things like async. In this article I’ll outline how this works in practice, and show some examples from wrapping the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) library in Nim.</description>

      <description>User mode schuduling in Windows is such a hot topic that there is about 3 total post about it on the internet. The stakes are high! First things first - I already described its mode of operation at DConf 2018.
So here I’ll just show some working code from implemenation of project Photon.
First here is how we spawn UserModeScheduled thread:

      <title>Self-Modifying Prompts</title>
      <link>https://natanyellin.com/posts/self-modifying-prompts/</link>
      <description>In some sense, LLMs have long-term and short-term memory. Long-term memory is the model itself and short-term memory is the current input.
When using chat.openai.com, the model only remembers the last 4K tokens. To bypass this limitation, I prompted ChatGPT to identify important information throughout our conversation and propogate it forward using a self-modifying prompt.
My original goal was to bypass limits on prompt length, but I discovered another benefit. You can reduce the amount of prompt-engineering and get ChatGPT to fine-tune itself.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Detection Engineering</title>
      <link>http://jvehent.org/2023/04/16/Data-Driven-Detection-Engineering.html</link>
      <description>In which I argue for stronger software engineering skills in cybersecurity, and a focus on data engineering. My initial foray in the world of detection &amp;amp; response occurred in the mid-2000s, when the field of cybersecurity was still nascent and white hats were figuring out how to industrialize defensive techniques. Back then, the job of a security engineer was to deploy intrusion detection systems across the network and write simple rules that would typically match on IP address or signature hashes. alert udp $EXTERNAL_NET 53 -&amp;gt; $HOME_NET any ( msg:&amp;quot;DNS SPOOF query response PTR with TTL of 1 min. and no authority&amp;quot;; content:&amp;quot;|85 80 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00|&amp;quot;; content:&amp;quot;|C0 0C 00 0C 00 01 00 00 00|&amp;lt;|00 0F|&amp;quot;; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:253; rev:4; ) an example of snort rule that alerts on suspicious DNS traffic Security engineers focused primarily on network infrastructure and threat intelligence. Aggregating IOCs, applying rules to well-placed sensors and investigating alerts was an analyst’s primary focus. You’d place tripwires all over the place, and wait for an attacker to trigger an alert. This seems to have served us well for a long time. We refined it over the years, with more sophisticated alert languages, frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK that helped organize threats, log aggregation systems like Splunk, etc. And judging by the content of most BSides conferences, it is still the go-to approach for a lot of teams out there. However, my observation over the past five years, first building the threat detection pipeline at Mozilla, then running the Cloud Detection team at Google, is that detection &amp;amp; response has shifted to focus on data driven detection engineering. The future of D&amp;amp;R leverages complex data models using sophisticated pipelines to detect threats in anomalous behaviors. And, as an industry, we’re not ready for it.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#39;ve build mobile Web applications that need to run on iOS Safari and on an iPhone you might have run into the problem of input fields &amp;#39;auto-zooming&amp;#39; the display when the input field and popup keyboard get focus. The view zooms and doesn&amp;#39;t return back to the unzoomed even after exiting the input field. In this post I describe why this happens in some scenarios, and a couple of ways you can work around this annoying iOS Web browser behavior.</description>

      <title>mjg59 | Booting modern Intel CPUs</title>
      <link>https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/66109.html</link>
      <description>CPUs can&amp;#39;t do anything without being told what to do, which leaves the obvious problem of how do you tell a CPU to do something in the first place. On many CPUs this is handled in the form of a reset vector - an address the CPU is hardcoded to start reading instructions from when power is applied. The address the reset vector points to will typically be some form of ROM or flash that can be read by the CPU even if no other hardware has been configured yet. This allows the system vendor to ship code that will be executed immediately after poweron, configuring the rest of the hardware and eventually getting the system into a state where it can run user-supplied code.</description>

      <title>Covariance and Contravariance in C#</title>
      <link>https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/cda93276-c9ab-42c3-8288-a9b3e5c8aa5c</link>
      <description>Let&amp;#39;s talk about Contravariance and Covariance in C# using .NET Framework examples!
