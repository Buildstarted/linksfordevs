      <title>Product idea: verifiable digital document sharing</title>

      <description>Some employers, utility companies, banks or government departments still require you to be in possession of physical documents - it’s now 2021 and this is stupid.</description>

      <title>Moral basis for regulating social platforms</title>
      <link>https://solus.life/writing/moral-basis-for-regulating-social-platforms.html</link>
      <description>Is it moral to regulate Twitter? It feels wrong that social platforms have the power to arbitrary filter content. But they are private companies, so they have the right to do as they please. How do we reconcile?</description>

      <title>Simulation is easy, probability is hard...</title>
      <link>https://magnusross.github.io/posts/mc/</link>
      <description>There are many interesting things that can be learned about probabilistic modelling from the world of trading and finance, where, perhaps due to the direct connection to very large sums of money, attitudes to problems are generally very different to those of the typical statistician or ML practitioner. Two books I have enjoyed recently in the area are The Education of a Speculator by Victor Niederhoffer and Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</description>

      <title>Big Tech Censorship</title>
      <link>https://objectivedissent.org/2021/01/22/big-tech-censorship/</link>
      <description>What Big Tech is doing in deplatforming prominent right-wing figures, based on prodding from certain NGOs and politicians, is in fact censorship, even if Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff calls it “censorship by proxy”.&amp;#160; I have held this position for years.&amp;#160; The question is not “Is the government doing this censoring?” The question is, “Are the people who are in effective control of our government doing this censoring using private companies as proxies because there is still a modicum of honesty in the courts when dealing with First Amendment issues that prevents the government (at least for now) from passing anti-hate-speech laws?”</description>
