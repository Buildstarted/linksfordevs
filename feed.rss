      <title>Unlocking Kafka&amp;#39;s Potential: Tackling Tail Latency with eBPF</title>
      <link>https://blog.allegro.tech/2024/03/kafka-performance-analysis.html</link>
      <description>At Allegro, we use Kafka as a backbone for asynchronous communication between microservices. With up to
300k messages published and 1M messages consumed every second, it is a key part of our infrastructure. A few months ago, in our main Kafka cluster, we noticed
the following discrepancy: while median response times for produce requests
were in single-digit milliseconds, the tail latency was much worse. Namely, the
p99 latency was up to 1 second, and the p999 latency was up to 3 seconds. This was unacceptable for a new project that we were about to start, so we
decided to look into this issue. In this blog post, we would like to describe our journey — how we used Kafka protocol sniffing and eBPF to identify and remove
the performance bottleneck.

You can find that post here:https://lev-0.com/2024/01/29/dmvpn-opennhrp-over-wireguard-netbird-on-vyos/ While that can be a great solution, the extensibility of that solution is limited.

      <description>Every time I need to play with atomic variables and I try to be clever and optimize them as much as possible I need to re-learn what the various memory ordering options do. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that memory ordering is easily one of the most complex topics I ever worked with. For this reason I decided to finally write down what I (think) I know about memory ordering, making it easier for the future me …</description>

      <title>Learning is Compression</title>
      <link>https://eitanporat.github.io/posts/learning-is-compression/</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we explore how compressing data is equivalent to learning data distributions. Not in the sense that neural networks are compressing data in their weights, but in an information theoretic sense. Following up on Shannon&amp;#39;s work, we use a GPT-2 model from Karpathy&amp;#39;s nanoGPT repo to create a compression algorithm which combines Shannon encoding with next-token prediction. Using this model, we get a compression algorithm which beats the native python implementation (18.9% vs 44.73%)</description>

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Mar/08/Comparing-Raw-ASPNET-Request-Throughput-across-Versions</link>
      <description>When I set up a new machine I usually use a small ASP.NET test project to get a feel of performance of the machine and when that happens I also take a moment to compare performance across recent versions of .NET to see how things are improving - and improved they have. Both due to the new hardware I&amp;#39;m using but also ASP.NET continues to bump up performance in every new version that comes out. In this post I describe a simple project with minimal do nothing requests to test the ASP,.NET pipeline locally and how to test these request as well as discussing the results.</description>
