      <title>xz backdoor - Dmitry Kudryavtsev</title>
      <link>https://www.yieldcode.blog/post/xz-backdoor/</link>
      <description>
A malicious backdoor was discovered in xz library that implements LZMA compression.
xz, among many other places, is used, indirectly, in sshd.
My attempt to explain what happened.

      <title>Use OpenVPN as a proxy to more comfortably access internal Gitlab</title>
      <link>https://blog.kulman.sk/use-openvn-as-proxy/</link>
      <description>I currently work on a project that uses a self hosted Gitlab instance for git and this Gitlab instance can be only accessed after connecting to the company’s OpenVPN.
I did not want to be connected to OpenVPN all the time from my machine, especially this being a side project that I do not work on every day.
Every time I needed to push or pull code or create or review a PR I connected to OpenVPN, did what I need to do, disconnected.</description>

      <title>Abstraction is much more than interfaces</title>
      <link>https://andreiboar.com/posts/abstraction-is-much-more-than-interfaces/</link>
      <description>When people learn about abstraction, they usually focus on the means used to achieve it: abstract classes, objects, functions, or interfaces.
They read that abstraction is used to hide background details or unnecessary implementation of the data so that users see only the required information.
It makes sense. When you drive a car you don’t care how it’s implemented, you only want to drive from Point A to Point B.</description>

      <title>The Video That Inspired Me To Create Odin</title>
      <link>https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2024/04/04/video-that-inspired-odin/</link>
      <description>[Originally from a Twitter Thread]
Original Twitter Post
Many people may not know this but this video by Sean Barrett @nothings is partially the reason why I made the Odin programming language.
And I’ll explain what insights it gave me in this thread &amp;#129525;.
A lot of these seem “so obvious” but for some reason it never clicked to me before this video. A lot of the “higher level” “scripting” languages are not that much higher level than C.</description>

      <description>Today, I had to pivot (pun intended) from my usual tasks to help a colleague with a query. The task is deceptively simple: Collect metadata about all columns of a table in a single query. This was to be a function in PostgreSQL that would return a table with the following columns:</description>

      <title>Measuring your system’s performance using software (Go edition) – Daniel Lemire&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://lemire.me/blog/2024/03/17/measuring-your-systems-performance-using-software-go-edition/</link>
      <description>When programming software, we are working over an abstraction over a system. The computer hardware may not know about your functions, your variables, and your data. It may only see bits and instructions. Yet to write efficient software, the programmer needs to be aware of the characteristics of the underlying system. Thankfully, we can also use the software itself to observe the behavior of the system through experiments.</description>

      <title>HTTP/2 `CONTINUATION` Flood</title>
      <link>https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood/</link>
      <description>What is the CONTINUATION Flood? It is a new class of vulnerabilities in multiple implementations of HTTP/2 protocol. The root cause is an incorrect handling of HEADERS and multiple CONTINUATION frames which ultimately leads to Denial of Service.
The outcome depends on the implementation but ranges from instant crash after sending a couple of HTTP/2 frames, Out Of Memory crash, to CPU exhaustion affecting server availability.
More technical details can be found in HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood: Technical Details post.</description>

      <title>Exploring Batch Caching of Trees</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2024/04/batch-caching-of-trees</link>
      <description>From my other posts it might seem that I am a bit of a React hater - not at all. React and related frameworks have introduced a very powerful concept into the web development field - the concept of materialised trees. In fact, we have been dealing with those in Rails for years now as well. Standard Rails rendering has been a cornerstone of dozens of applications to date, and continues to be so. But once you see “trees everywhere” it is hard not to think about optimising using trees. So let me share an idea I’ve had recently which might as well be very neat.</description>

And then my second one: oh bugger, here goes my weekend. Now, I won’t go into the technical details, there are many, many, many, many better resources out there, but I can’t help thinking that this would/should force the software industry to think.</description>
