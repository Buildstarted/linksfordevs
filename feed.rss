      <title>Bite size linux!</title>
      <link>https://gumroad.com/l/bite-size-linux</link>
      <description>Confused about what a system call is? Heard the term "file descriptor" but not sure what it means? This zine is for you!! It has 19 important Linux concepts, each explained with a simple 1-page comic. You'll learn about threads, permissions, processes, memory allocation, mmap, shared libraries, and much more! You'll get a delightful PDF of a 24-page zine that you can either read online or print out &amp; share with your friends! Print directions: The "print version" is formatted so that when you print it on your printer, it will fold correctly. You'll need to: * make sure it's set to "landscape". * print double sided. * choose "long edge" (not "short edge"). Some people have told me that the emails from Gumroad after buying the zine end up in their spam folder, so check there if you don't see it! You can find me on Twitter at https://twitter.com/b0rk and my email address is julia@jvns.ca.</description>

      <title>Balancing work on GC threads | .NET Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/balancing-work-on-gc-threads/</link>
      <description>In Server GC, each GC thread will work on its heap in parallel (that's a simplistic view and is not necessarily true for all phases but on the high level it's exact the idea of a parallel GC). So that alone means work is already split between GC threads.</description>

      <title>Hardware Solutions To Highly-Adversarial Environments - Whitebox Crypto vs TPM vs TEE vs Secure Enclaves vs Secure Elements vs HSM vs CloudHSM vs KMS</title>

      <description>If at some point you realize that doing cryptography means having to manage long-term keys, it means you’re standing in the world of key management.

In these lands, you are going to run into scenarios where attackers can be quite close to your applications.
I call these highly-adversarial environments.
