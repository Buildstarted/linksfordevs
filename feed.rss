      <link>https://arslan.io/2024/09/23/dieter-rams-inspired-iphone-dock/</link>
      <description>Dieter Rams and his friends (Dietrich Lubs and Ludwig Littman) designed many great looking alarm clocks. I&amp;#39;m looking for one for a long time. Because I have many books about Braun (the company) and Dieter Rams, here are some of their designs:

      <title>Use keyed services in ASP.NET Core | BinaryIntellect Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/9a08452a-8ee5-4d6b-adde-26908b8ba69b.aspx</link>
      <description>A few years ago I wrote an article describing how ASP.NET Core DI container behaves when multiple implementations of an interface are registered. It&amp;#39;s time to revisit the concept because .NET 8 has something better to offer -- Keyed Services. I am going to use the same example that I used in the earlier article. We will modify the example for .NET 8.</description>

      <title>It is hard to recommend Google Cloud</title>
      <link>https://ashishb.net/programming/google-cloud/</link>
      <description>Google Domains A year back, I had to migrate my domain after Google decided to shut down Google Domains. I had to, not only, painfully setup multiple side-projects sub-domain mappings again on a new domain registrar but also re-verify my domain and re-create those mappings on Google Cloud Run.
Google Container Registry Google Container Registry is shutting down in 2025. It has been replaced with a new project called Artifact Registry.</description>

      <title>Uber Caught Overcharging? How Having Credits in Your Account Might Be Costing You - View from the Wing</title>
      <link>https://viewfromthewing.com/uber-caught-overcharging-how-having-credits-in-your-account-might-be-costing-you/</link>
      <description>My hypothesis was that Uber seemed to be picking a higher price because I had credits in my account. I might be willing to spend more because my &amp;#39;real&amp;#39; out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped anyway.  I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead. That pricing seemed normal.</description>
