      <title>Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02479</link>
      <description>New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to
conform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its
requirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal
data. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's
consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the
top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied
consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet the minimal requirements that we set
based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40
participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent
choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect;
removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22--23
percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page
decreases consent by 8--20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical
basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular
the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an
effective way to increase compliance.</description>

      <description>Testing gives confidence in written code. In the context of this article, ‘testing’ means ‘automated testing’. Without automated testing, it is significantly harder to ensure the quality of a web application of significant complexity. Fails caused by automated testing may lead to more bugs in production. In this article, we’re going to show how React developers can quickly start testing their app with the React Testing Library (RTL).</description>

      <title>Just in time knowledge - Niall Bunting</title>
      <link>https://niallbunting.com/daily/knowledge/just/in/time/2020/07/01/just-in-time-knowledge.html</link>
      <description>The idea of just in time (JIT) comes from manufacturing, it meant changing processes so a part would only be manufactured when it was needed, reducing stock that isn’t needed. Can we take these lean ideas of waste reduction and apply them to knowledge?</description>

      <description>After working on Spartan game engine for so long, it became increasingly obvious that there are many interesting things that I could be writing about. However, I kept postponing it as I was growing fond of Hugo and didn’t want to invest any content (or money) on WordPress anymore. The good thing is that I’ve finally found the courage to transition to this slick and fast site you’re browsing now!</description>

      <link>https://newsletter.fraunhofer.de/-viewonline2/17386/465/11/14SHcBTt/V44RELLZBp/1</link>
      <description>Through a reduction of data requirements, H.266/VVC makes video transmission in mobile networks (where data capacity is limited) more efficient. For instance, the previous standard H.265/HEVC requires ca. 10 gigabytes of data to transmit a 90-min UHD video. With this new technology, only 5 gigabytes of data are required to achieve the same quality. Because H.266/VVC was developed with ultra-high-resolution video content in mind, the new standard is particularly beneficial when streaming 4K or 8K videos on a flat screen TV. Furthermore, H.266/VVC is ideal for all types of moving images: from high-resolution 360° video panoramas to screen sharing contents.</description>
