      <title>Live Tech Games massively scales its gaming platform with Microsoft Azure during the FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1660597148686808572-live-tech-games-azure-gaming-fifa-world-cup-uk</link>
      <description>Live Tech Games is on a mission to create unique, massively multiplayer mobile gaming experiences that people genuinely want to be a part of. To achieve this, Live Tech Games runs live social tournament games. At set times (for example, 7 PM each evening), a push notification announces the game is starting, and users play live against each other at that moment. Live Tech Games also runs games that are televised live in event halls and pubs after live shows and sporting events to help draw in large audiences from across the United Kingdom. In September 2022, Live Tech Games began working on Knockout, a new football trivia game in which players go head-to-head in three rounds televised at the end of each match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.</description>
