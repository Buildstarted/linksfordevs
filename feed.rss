      <title>How to make MPAs that are as fast as SPAs</title>
      <link>https://gomakethings.com/how-to-make-mpas-that-are-as-fast-as-spas/</link>
      <description>Yesterday, I wrote about how SPAs were a mistake. Today, I want to talk about how you can build multi-page apps (or, you know, regular websites) that are as fast as SPAs.
Let’s dig in!
A quick summary The sites and apps I build are absurdly fast. They load nearly instantly.
Even on spotty 3G connections on the other side of the world, where many of my students live, things still load really quickly (like, 3 seconds or less fast).</description>

      <title>Guess the Startup by @ttunguz
</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/tale-of-two-databases/</link>
      <description>I’m going to tell you a bit about two startups and I’d like you to guess the name of each company.
Both of these businesses are publicly traded. Both startups provide database software to developers to build applications. Both have grown very fast. In fact, their revenue trajectories through 2020 are nearly identical. Both companies employ a usage-based pricing model: pay for what you use.
In 2016, each company recorded less than $50m in revenue.</description>
