      <description>It&amp;#39;s great to be able to develop locally without needing a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; database to connect to. Azurite is an Azure Storage emulator which exists to support just that.

      <title>Simple Cluster Monitoring with Munin</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2021/simple_cluster_monitoring/</link>
      <description>If you have more than one server to administrate, chances are you will
benefit from having at least a rudimentary form of monitoring in place.
Having access to usage statistics, thermal sensors, and the like will
make your life immensely easier in the long run. When Max
and I started working on the compute cluster of our lab in earnest, we
wanted a lightweight monitoring solution that would be easy to set up,
leaving us room to grow. After evaluating existing solutions, I decided
to go with Munin, a lightweight
server–client set of monitoring plugins. These notes provide some
details about how to set it up and easily gain access to warnings.</description>

      <description>If you spend time working in the terminal, whether for work or leisure, a lot
of the commands you type often have a dependency on other recent commands, 
might be repetitive actions, or be very similar to other commands previously
run. Gaining mastery over your shell history is a great way to be more
productive in the terminal.</description>

      <title>Building a Personal [Origami] Website in 2021</title>
      <link>https://origami.kosmulski.org/blog/2021-05-16-building-personal-origami-website-2021</link>

While a few details are specific to origami, most are completely general and should be interesting to anyone planning to create their personal web page, regardless of topic.</description>
