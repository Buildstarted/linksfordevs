      <description>Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,
were writing and programming. I didn&amp;#39;t write essays. I wrote what
beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still
are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,
just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them
deep.</description>

      <description>Anyway, a few people from SVLUG, including
Don Marti, Rick Moen (yes he was 
there), Chris DiBona,
the world famous Nick Moffitt, and Tabinda Khan, organized the Bay Area windows
refund effort.
Since at the Linux tea party, microsoft showed up at
our meeting point to try to deter us from going to their offices in Palo Alto,
this time, the ultimate meeting point was kept secret, and 4 officers revealed
it at the last minute to the crowd that had gathered, as planned, at the four
meeting points around the Bay Area.</description>

      <title>Your phone vs. Supercomputers</title>

      <description>Today, I looked up how many floating point operations per second (FLOPS) that an iPhone can do. It turns out the A14 chip in the iPhone can do about 11 TFlOPS according to Apple. Let&amp;#39;s give Apple the benefits of the doubt and not get too deep into how they got that number, and put it to perspective and compare the iPhone with the Top 500 Supercomputers in the world over the years:</description>

      <title>The Database Inside Your Codebase</title>
      <link>https://feifan.blog/posts/the-database-inside-your-codebase</link>
      <description>Navigating codebases of any meaningful size is difficult. Most of a programmer&amp;#39;s time is spent jumping through the codebase, reading or skimming to build a mental model of the constructs and conventions within it. These constructs — among them: the DSLs, interfaces, and taxonomy of types that exist — are arguably the most important precursor to understanding where and how to make changes. But these constructs only exist in programmers&amp;#39; heads. It&amp;#39;s difficult or impossible to navigate most codebases through the lens of those constructs; programmers lack &amp;quot;code browsers&amp;quot; that present the underlying code independently of files and the filesystem hierarchy. Yet code browsers that can do so — and we&amp;#39;ll look at some examples below — would be incredibly useful. This is because instances of these constructs can be thought of as records in a database, albeit an ad-hoc, poorly-specified database that can only be queried through carefully-crafted regexes.</description>

However, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they don&amp;#39;t have blindspots and biases. Here&amp;#39;s a few of them, along with interactive aplications for you to try it out yourself.</description>
