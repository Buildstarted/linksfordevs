      <title>The Early Years of Peter Thiel</title>
      <link>https://jayriverlong.github.io/2021/10/03/thiel.html</link>
      <description>Peter Thiel carries an air of mystery. His story intertwines erudition, success, political controversy, out-there contrarianism, and ideological views that sometimes seem self-contradictory. His position in popular culture reminds of a conservative George Soros: an academic philosopher turned financier, heavily politically active, and vilified by the opposition press. They are exceptionally successful investors, each cementing their status with one legendary deal.1 Their empires sprawl so far that they always show up somewhere if you dig far enough – turning them into Keyser Soze-style boogeymen to their detractors.</description>

      <title>How Customer Obsession Relates to Success</title>
      <link>https://blog.awill.me/2021-10-01/customer-obsession/</link>
      <description>I’ve worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS) for almost 7 years now. Amazon is famous for its leadership principles. The intent of these principles is to guide decision making, and the most important of these is customer obsession. It’s the idea that treating your customers right is not just the right thing to do, it’s also good for business. We all buy from Amazon.com because it’s better than the competition. Shipping is cheaper and faster; they generally have a larger selection than the competition, and they make very, very few mistakes with shipping.</description>

And what would be the Moon, Mars and Venus with as much water as on the Earth?

      <title>Rodney Littles II - Is there an echo?</title>
      <link>https://rodneylittlesii.com/posts/topic/foundation-echo-chamber</link>
      <description>When I ran for the .NET Foundation Board, I found it odd that the legacy members were silent.  There was no word from them on the experience.  There was no understanding of their thought on the state of affairs in the .NET Foundation.  There was an election.  We shuffled them out without a word and brought in new board members in total silence.  The silence I heard was loud enough for me to realize the potential problem.  I proceeded anyway, with caution.</description>
