      <title>The Tale of One-way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012023</link>
      <description>The existence of one-way functions is arguably the most important problem in
computer theory. The article discusses and refines a number of concepts
relevant to this problem. For instance, it gives the first combinatorial
complete owf, i.e., a function which is one-way if any function is. There are
surprisingly many subtleties in basic definitions. Some of these subtleties are
discussed or hinted at in the literature and some are overlooked. Here, a
unified approach is attempted.</description>

      <title>On using to-do lists efficiently</title>
      <link>https://bzg.fr/en/on-using-to-do-lists-efficiently/</link>
      <description>My happiness results from keeping a sane balance between achievements and what Jim Carrey calls &amp;quot;freedom of concern&amp;quot;1. I like to work and I love to daydream. As much as daydreaming is about wandering, work and personal achievements are about focusing, which in turn requires motivation, clarity of purpose and control, all of them sustained by discipline.
 Very often, your to-do list becomes your enemy. Because it gives you a false sense of control, it slowly erodes your goals&amp;#39; clarity, which weakens your motivation.</description>

      <title>Bringing GNU Emacs to Native Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02504</link>
      <description>Emacs Lisp (Elisp) is the Lisp dialect used by the Emacs text editor family.
GNU Emacs can currently execute Elisp code either interpreted or
byte-interpreted after it has been compiled to byte-code. In this work we
discuss the implementation of an optimizing compiler approach for Elisp
targeting native code. The native compiler employs the byte-compiler&amp;#39;s internal
representation as input and exploits libgccjit to achieve code generation using
the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) infrastructure. Generated executables are
stored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the
functionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several
optimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs
core and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able
to bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files,
including the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA). Native-compiled
Elisp shows an increase of performance ranging from 2.3x up to 42x with respect
to the equivalent byte-code, measured over a set of small benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Designing for Buying:
How to Break Through the Ceiling in Product-Led Growth</title>
      <link>https://sarahguo.com/blog/designing-for-buying</link>
      <description>Product-oriented teams are triumphantly declaring, “Sales and marketing had their time. The future is product-led growth.” In other words: if you build it, users will come. We at Greylock are longtime investors in product-led growth (PLG) companies such as Clockwise, Clubhouse, Coda, Demisto, Dropbox, Figma, Quip and Sqreen. I’ve recently invested in this trend of end-users becoming increasingly networked into communities, and therefore increasingly powerful. We understand the power of bottoms-up distribution. But we also continually see great product founders get caught flat-footed, underachieving against their growth goals when they rely solely on organic end-user adoption as their go-to-market (GTM) strategy, rather than as part of a whole-company system. Let’s look at the limits of PLG, a playbook for incorporating it into a more complete GTM strategy, and some of the unique challenges of getting this right.</description>
