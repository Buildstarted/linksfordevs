      <title>Empowerment to the People! What You Need to Know About Black People, Disability, and Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aqw7i9XPkA</link>
      <description>[w/ASL Interpreting]

About one fifth (20%) of the global population lives with disabilities.​ According to the 2017 American Community Survey, 13.6 percent of Black and African Americans have a disability. Further, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is almost double of other people, and the people with disabilities who are employed have lower earnings, in general.

This means we have an opportunity and a duty to empower Black people with technology. One of the most powerful ways we can do this is to make our messaging accessible—no matter the platform or media.

While many of us have heard that accessibility is important, we seldom hear about how to implement it in our everyday work. Angela will discuss how people in every discipline—including PMs, content writers, designers, engineers, and more—can do so and further amplify the voices of Black people.

Angela Hooker is a Senior Accessibility Program Manager at Microsoft, where she's built a center of expertise for accessibility, user experience, and universal design. She's brought her web management, development, design, accessibility, and editorial and content management expertise to the government and private sector for over 20 years.

Angela also advocates for role-based accessibility and believes that teaching people how to incorporate principles of accessibility in their everyday work creates a sustainable program and produces the most accessible user experiences. Angela speaks on and writes about accessibility, disability, user experience, and plain language.</description>

      <title>Seeing Like an Algorithm — Remains of the Day</title>

      <description>In my previous post on TikTok I discussed why its For You Page algorithm is the connective tissue that makes TikTok work. It is the bus on its motherboard that connects and closes all its feedback loops.</description>

      <title>VPNs from first principles</title>
      <link>https://fzakaria.com/2020/09/20/vpns-from-first-principles.html</link>
      <description>If you enjoy the from first principles theme, consider reading the one on containers. Networking can seem like voodoo; many of us take for granted how data transmits from one computer to the next. Recently, wireguard, has attracted a lot of publicity for it’s inclusion into the Linux kernel &amp; for it’s stated goal of making setting up VPNs simpler. Behind all the magic, is a very simple premise. Let’s shed some of the complexity and break it down to first principles.</description>

      <title>September 21st! A Charity Fundraiser</title>
      <link>https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21st/</link>
      <description>Five years, five September videos. A nice round number, and a perfect place for me to stop. There's only so much dancing I can do—my knees are getting bad and I am running out of closet space for all these decorations!  

That said, one of the nicest things about doing these September videos is using the attention as an opportunity to raise money for organizations whose goals I want to champion, whether that's fighting climate change, resources and rights of the unhoused, trans equality &amp;amp; political power, racial justice, reproductive rights, prisoner justice, or a variety of other social goods. So I will keep these September videos going for another year, by challenging you all to help me raise $50,000 for a few select organizations listed here. If we hit $50,000, I'll make another video! If we hit $100,000, uhhh, I'll make another video but also probably freak out because—wow!—that's a lot of money! If we hit $69,420, well...I’ll make another video, and have myself a giggle. (I’m only human.)  Please contribute! Anything helps, even a single dollar! It's a crucial time in our history for so many marginalized and underrepresented voices, and a little bit can go a long way in pushing the needle closer to a socially, politically, and environmentally just world. Thank you so much for your support, I love you!  

P.S.– if you can, VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Thank you to Erik Abriss + Ian Carr of Street Watch LA for helping me set up this fundraiser!) </description>

After having worked on a Rust codebase for almost two years now, I thought I would chime in, even though I'll preface the post by saying that Rust is totally the right language you should use if you know what you're doing and are aiming for performance and sec ...</description>
