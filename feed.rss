      <title>Wiki - SurveyOfSystemLanguages2024</title>
      <link>https://wiki.alopex.li/SurveyOfSystemLanguages2024</link>
      <description>In case you missed it, there’s a whole new generation of low-level
programming languages being created right now. Rust demonstrated vividly
in 2016 that there is a massive unmet need in this space, and it has
spawned a bunch of successor languages, though none of them have really
hit the relative big-time like Rust has. I’m one of those programmers
that has spent 20 years or so asking “can we PLEASE do low-level code in
anything besides C and C++?” so I wanted to take an actual look at the
languages I know about and do a bit of compare-and-contrast.</description>

      <title>Vector Search — Lucene is All You Need | Shaped Blog</title>
      <link>https://www.shaped.ai/blog/vector-search-lucene-is-all-you-need</link>
      <description>Recent research is challenging long-held assumptions about AI-powered search, questioning whether dedicated vector stores are truly necessary. As AI and search technologies continue to evolve, organizations are searching for solutions that balance efficiency, cost, and scalability. While dedicated vector databases have traditionally been considered essential for managing vector search tasks, they come with significant resource and infrastructure demands. Researchers from the University of Waterloo and Roma Tre University, however, suggest an alternative: leveraging the widely-used Lucene search library to handle vector search operations with OpenAI embeddings. This finding could offer a more accessible and versatile approach to advanced search capabilities, prompting organizations to rethink their reliance on specialized vector storage solutions.</description>

      <description>Launched in 1998, the 380Z was one very fine ThinkPad.

  It was the last ThinkPad to come in the classic bulky and rectangular form factor.

  It was also one of the first to feature a huge 13.3&amp;quot; TFT display, powerful 233MHz Pentium II, and whopping 160 megs of RAM.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Janet RPC | Joe Creager</title>
      <link>https://joecreager.com/introduction-to-janet-rpc/</link>
      <description>Janet is a modern Lisp with a rich standard library in a tiny package. Janet is quickly becoming my favorite Lisp for tasks I might have accomplished with bash/sh or python in the past thanks to its ability to produce small statically linked binaries. In this article we’ll explore remote procedure calls (RPC) with the spork package. Since RPC involves making calls over a network all code examples are divided by the client and server implementation in client.janet and server.janet. Follow along by running the examples on your own machine. You can view the example in once place as a gist.</description>
