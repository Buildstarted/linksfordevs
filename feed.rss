      <title>Code Scanning C++ with GitHub Actions</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/code-scanning-with-github-actions/</link>
      <description>Last year, GitHub released code scanning, which enables developers to incorporate security checks into their CI/CD environment and developer workflow. This post demonstrates the basics of using CodeQL, the analysis engine behind code scanning, with GitHub Actions. What is CodeQL? CodeQL is an analysis engine that automates security checks by running queries against a database generated from your codebase.</description>

      <title>Announcing Arti, a pure-Rust Tor implementation | Tor Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.torproject.org/announcing-arti</link>
      <description>Greetings!
Today I&amp;#39;m happy to announce a new era in Tor implementation.
Over the past year or so, we&amp;#39;ve been working on &amp;quot;Arti&amp;quot;, a project to rewrite Tor in Rust. Thanks to funding from Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG), we can finally put the Arti project up in our priorities list, and devote more time to it.
Below I&amp;#39;ll talk about why we&amp;#39;re doing this project, what it means for Tor users and operators, where it&amp;#39;s going in the future, and how people can help.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374</link>
      <description>We introduce Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available
code from GitHub, and study its Python code-writing capabilities. A distinct
production version of Codex powers GitHub Copilot. On HumanEval, a new
evaluation set we release to measure functional correctness for synthesizing
programs from docstrings, our model solves 28.8% of the problems, while GPT-3
solves 0% and GPT-J solves 11.4%. Furthermore, we find that repeated sampling
from the model is a surprisingly effective strategy for producing working
solutions to difficult prompts. Using this method, we solve 70.2% of our
problems with 100 samples per problem. Careful investigation of our model
reveals its limitations, including difficulty with docstrings describing long
chains of operations and with binding operations to variables. Finally, we
discuss the potential broader impacts of deploying powerful code generation
technologies, covering safety, security, and economics.</description>

      <title>Open API support for ASP.NET Core Minimal API</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/openapi-support-for-aspnetcore-minimal-webapi/</link>
      <description>This article will discuss about implementing Open API (Swagger) for ASP.NET Core 6.0 minimal API. Today I saw one video from Maria Naggaga about Minimal APIs. She was showing a demo of Web API with swagger support. So thought I will implement the same. But it was not working for me. I was getting a lot of errors - both compile time and runtime. Then I looked into the ASP.NET Core source code and found one extension method which was not available in the runtime I was using. So I upgraded the version and installed the - 6.0.100-preview.6.21357.52 version and it started working. If you’re not using this version the code in this blog post will not work.</description>
