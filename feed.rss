      <title>Model-View-Controller, a classic architectural pattern in Clojure</title>
      <link>https://blog.janetacarr.com/model-view-controller-a-classic-architectural-pattern-in-clojure/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m sure for some of you Model-View-Controller (MVC) resembles more of an anti-pattern than something to reach for when writing Clojure, but I think it&amp;#39;s a great example of what architecture should accomplish, especially what can be accomplished in Clojure.

MVC decouples state, state changes, and state usage. One way</description>

      <title>Synology NAS Backups with Minimal Bus Factor</title>
      <link>https://willbush.dev/blog/synology-nas-backup/</link>
      <description>If you&amp;#39;re wanting to backup your Synology NAS, you probably just want to use one of their off-the-shelf solutions in their Package Center. However, if you&amp;#39;re stubborn like me and want to use the same CLI tool you use elsewhere, this post is for you. I&amp;#39;ll describe how to use restic to backup folders you care about on your Synology NAS to an external hard drive and S3 conformant cloud storage providers that are supported by restic and one supported by rclone. If you want to use another command line tool, much of the instructions I provide here should still be applicable.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Critique and Iterate on Their Own Outputs?</title>
      <link>https://evjang.com/2023/03/26/self-reflection.html</link>
      <description>Avi Singh told me yesterday about a recent arxiv preprint, Reflexion, that proposes the following idea: use a LLM to examine whether the output of another generative model is “on the right track” during generation. According to the paper, “the reflection loop aims to help the agent correct common cases of hallucination and inefficiency through trial and error.” Reflexion extends the ReAct architecture to predict whether the agent should stop generating, pause, and reflect on its entire generated trajectory. Should the agent decide to self-reflect with a LLM, it restarts the generation process with its LLM critique of its past trajectory loaded in-context. The paper is evaluated against text-based decision-making benchmarks like AlfWorld, HotPotQA, and WebShop. If it helps the intuition, you can think of this like someone sending you a text, then quickly “unsending” it and then sending a new one.</description>

      <title>Zig And Rust Mar 26, 2023</title>
      <link>https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/26/zig-and-rust.html</link>
      <description>This post will be a bit all over the place.
Several months ago, I wrote Hard Mode Rust, exploring an allocation-conscious style of programming.
In the ensuing discussion, @jamii name-dropped TigerBeetle, a reliable, distributed, fast, and small database written in Zig in a similar style, and, well, I now find myself writing Zig full-time, after more than seven years of Rust.
This post is a hand-wavy answer to the why? question.
It is emphatically not a balanced and thorough comparison of the two languages.
I haven&amp;#39;t yet written my 100k lines of Zig to do that.
(if you are looking for a more general what the heck is Zig, I can recommend @jamii&amp;#39;s post).
In fact, this post is going to be less about languages, and more about styles of writing software (but pre-existing knowledge of Rust and Zig would be very helpful).
Without further caveats, let&amp;#39;s get started.</description>

      <description>Source generators are a powerful feature introduced to C#, allowing developers to generate additional code during the compilation process automatically. They can help reduce boilerplate, improve performance, and simplify your codebase.
This blog post will introduce source generators, discuss how they work, and walk through an example of a source generator for generating build information.
