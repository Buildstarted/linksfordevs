      <title>Getting rid of warnings with nullable reference types and JSON object models in C#</title>
      <link>https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2023/01/12/getting-rid-of-warnings-with-nullable-reference-types-and-json-object-models-in-csharp.html</link>
      <description>In my blog series, Nullable reference types in C# - Migrating to nullable reference types, we discussed the benefits of enabling nullable reference types in your C# code, and annotating your code so the compiler and IDE can give you more reliable hints about whether a particular variable or property may need to be checked for being null before using it.</description>

      <description>I﻿f you&amp;#39;ve done any React development, you&amp;#39;ve probably heard of &amp;quot;hooks&amp;quot; in components. Hooks enable you to reuse logic across your project&amp;#39;s components. Hooks help minimize repetition of code, and also make your project&amp;#39;s easier to maintain. React has a few &amp;quot;built in&amp;quot; hooks, but also allows you to build your own. In this post I&amp;#39;m </description>

      <title>9 Best Practices to Safely Deploy and Keep Your Application Healthy at Scale</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/safe-application-deployment/</link>
      <description>Disclaimer: This blog post was written by a human, with no AI-generated text. An application’s code base is a living entity. It keeps growing, changing, and adapting. There’s always a new feature to add, more bugs to solve, and new bugs that are created as a result. As the teams grow, the code changes more often and there are ever more features, more issues, and more bugs. Thorough manual testing becomes impossible the bigger your application gets and as you ship more frequently.</description>

      <description>API Management has evolved! Carl and Richard talk to Tom Kerkhove about his new role working on Azure API Management. Tom talks about using Azure Arc to deploy the API Management service into your on-premises services. The conversation digs into more of the fundamentals around API management with rate limiting, authentication and authorization, billing, testing, and more. A good API can make your company money - executed poorly and it&amp;#39;s a massive headache. Use the tools available to make it easier!</description>

      <description>Day-to-day politeness may be a useful social contract. Most people, if asked, will claim that they are perfectly aware that a flight attendant’s smile is fake, but that they don’t mind that. A friend once said: “I will choose fake politeness over sincere gloom, every time”. I feel he could easily be speaking on behalf of modern humanity.</description>

      <title>Programming by Hand Will Remain Essential</title>
      <link>https://karecha.com/blog/2023/01/10/programming-by-hand-will-remain-essential/</link>
      <description>Here is why old-fashioned programming by hand will not go away after the onset of AI-assisted programming. Think of programming by hand,  unaided by AI, as something similar to walking. Walking is essential for getting us around and improving our health and general well-being. There is enough evidence (see here and here) for how walking improves creativity in any field, including art, math, science, or business. But in terms of helping us get around, walking is perhaps our last choice. We don’t walk to work except for the lucky few who live within walking distance from their workplace. We don’t walk to a vacation destination. We don’t walk to a business conference across the country or across continents. Depending on the distance you need to go, you may choose anything from biking, driving, taking a train, or flying. Yet, walking remains indispensable and we should and we do walk when we can. Transportation tech is advancing every day but we will never forego the ability to walk just because there are faster and more comfortable alternatives.</description>

      <title>The Space Between Programs</title>
      <link>https://jimmyhmiller.github.io/space-between</link>
      <description>The “space” between our programs is an aspect we almost entirely overlook, yet, it is crucial to many aspects of our design. By “space”, I don’t mean the interface that the program exposes. Nor do I mean the means of communication (http, a queue, a log, etc). I am instead looking at something more amorphous. If we think about programs and their connectors taking up space on a 2d plane, what I want to talk about is the negative space. Or in other words, what do our programs leave out, what do our programs leave room for, and what, by their existence, have they excluded?</description>
