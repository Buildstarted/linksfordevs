      <link>https://phaazon.net/blog/zig-2025</link>
      <description>Ah, Zig. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A “new” (reading: appeared a couple years ago,
already — yes, already), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design
to solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged
unions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C
successor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there —
even Rust! — allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather
than — quoting from the Zig mantra — your language knowledge. I think I need to put the full mantra
because I will reuse it through this article:</description>

      <description>Rewriting code isn&amp;#39;t a magic fix-all. Consider the opportunity cost, complexity of the old system, and estimation challenges. Instead of stopping all to rewrite or building new while maintaining the old, try incremental improvements and new code adoption.</description>

      <title>Why French is so hard to understand</title>
      <link>https://joshdavham.com/language/2025/02/05/french-hard.html</link>
      <description>One of the first things new French learners notice early on is just how hard the language is to understand. It’s not obvious to most French learners why this is; only that French seems to become significantly harder when it moves from words on a page to words coming out of a person’s mouth.</description>

      <description>prompt engineering is nothing but an attempt to reverse-engineer a non-deterministic black box for which any of the parameters below are unknown:

- training set
- weights
- constraints on the model
- layers between you and the model that transform both your input and the model&amp;#39;s output that can change at any time
- availability of compute for your specific query</description>

      <title>The Surcharge of Big Tech</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/02/the-surcharge-of-big-tech</link>
      <description>There is a lot of talk that big-tech companies are willing to pay way more, way up north of the market to the local rates. They all seem similar: Pre-IPO or public Looking for senior software engineers or staff engineers Salary brackets never published, and even recruiters stay fairly tight lipped So-described “transparent” interview process - usually a marathon of systems design, “culture fit” and leetcode-like excercises And yet it seems that it is hard for those firms to acquire talent, even though in some cases they are prepared to offer compensation 40% to 50% higher than a standard local development agency would. Why is that? Well, they know what they are recruiting for. It is a challenging environment, and – despite it sometimes lookign otherwise – they want the people they hire to still be able to perform.</description>

In this video, we tackle a common but tricky interview question: Level Order Traversal in Binary Trees. Many CS graduates struggle with this fundamental concept, but today, we&amp;#39;re breaking it down step by step!

Problem Breakdown:
- Given a binary tree, print each level on a separate line
- Maintain the correct order of nodes from left to right
- Output should display the hierarchy clearly

      <description>We’ve all been there—you’re halfway through a multi-step transaction, and boom! &amp;#128165; Something fails. You don’t want to roll back everything, just the part that went wrong. That’s where Transactional Savepoints come in! Savepoints let you partially roll back transactions, keeping the good stuff while undoing just the problematic parts. If you&amp;#39;ve ever wished for a &amp;quot;Ctrl + Z&amp;quot; in database operations, this is it.</description>
