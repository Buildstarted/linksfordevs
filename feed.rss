      <title>The LLM productivity puzzle — Andreas Fragner</title>
      <link>https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/llm-productivity-puzzle</link>
      <description>Code generation is arguably one of the most interesting applications of LLMs, and it’s quickly gained traction (Copilot/Codex, Codegen, etc.). If you spend time on the internet these days you’ll see people claim productivity gains ranging from 0 to 100x, selection-biased to the high end. Whenever yo</description>

      <title>Delimited files are hell-- a comparison of methods to read bad files</title>
      <link>https://json.blog/2023/01/21/delimited-files-are.html</link>
      <description>Here’s a real live example of why I am stuck with R and stuck with data.table. In my work, I often receive various delimited files from customers. Mostly, these delimited files are created from Oracle or MS SQL and have all kinds of gnarly things going on. Without sharing too much, here’s a partial example of the last few fields of one line in one of those files:

      <description>Rails just recently added a default /up route that will return a 200 when the application is running.

I&amp;#39;ve had to implement this in pretty much every Rails app I&amp;#39;ve ever worked on. This is a nice addition!

      <title>Questioning My Approach to Advice</title>
      <link>https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2023/questioning-my-approach-to-advice/</link>
      <description>Good advice is very difficult to give. This is because it is inherently context dependent. Advice is inextricably linked with the lived experience of the person giving the advice. No matter how well conceived or written, the value of advice is limited by its applicability to a given situation.</description>
