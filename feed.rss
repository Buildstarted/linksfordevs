      <title>10 Most(ly dead) Influential Programming Languages ‚Ä¢ Hillel Wayne</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/</link>
      <description>The other day I read 20 most significant programming languages in history, a ‚Äúpreposterous table I just made up.‚Äù He certainly got preposterous right: he lists Go as ‚Äúmost significant‚Äù but not ALGOL, Smalltalk, or ML. He also leaves off Pascal because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmostly dead‚Äù. Preposterous! That defeats the whole point of what ‚Äúsignificant in history‚Äù means.
So let‚Äôs talk about some ‚Äúmostly dead‚Äù languages and why they matter so much.</description>

      <title>Letter to myself in late 2008</title>
      <link>https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008</link>
      <description>[I originally wrote and distributed this post to Y Combinator founders and have been encouraged to share it publicly, so here it is.] For context: in 2008 I was the founder/CEO of a company called imeem, which at the time had ~90 employees, good metrics, but high burn. I don‚Äôt think the 2020 crisis happening now is the same as what happened in 2008. But maybe the advice I wish I would have listened to in 2008 can help someone today.</description>

Everyone around the world is coming together to do their part, whether that‚Äôs working on finding a vaccine, delivering food and supplies, or staying indoors. Whatever the case, all of our daily routines have been thrown completely out of whack. It‚Äôs easy to get scared at a time like this, which is why focusing on something can help you stay calm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Depth Buffers</title>
      <link>https://miketuritzin.com/post/hierarchical-depth-buffers/</link>
      <description>Overview A hierarchical depth buffer is a multi-level depth (Z) buffer used as an acceleration structure for depth queries. As with normal texture mip chains, the dimensions of each level are generally successive power-of-2 fractions of the full-resolution buffer‚Äôs dimensions. In this article I present two techniques for generating a hierarchical depth buffer from a full-resolution one.
First I show how to generate the full mip chain for a depth buffer in a way that preserves depth query accuracy in texture coordinate (or NDC) space even for non-power-of-2 depth buffer dimensions.</description>

      <title>The man who made the NES</title>
      <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-15-the-man-who-made-the-nes</link>
      <description>Maybe it's about being in the right place at the right time. How else to explain how Masayuki Uemura, an engineer born in wartime Japan to a humble background, came to change the course of video game history? Uemura is the man who designed the Famicom, a pivotal piece of plastic whose legacy can be seen throughout the modern industry; in many ways, it's the machine that defined modern Nintendo. "You know, it's only when someone like you comes along and asks a lot of questions that makes me think maybe I was a part of some big thing," he says with no small amount of modesty as we chat in a small, quiet space on the ground floor of Sheffield's Castle House.</description>
