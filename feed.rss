      <link>https://www.fws.gov/birds/news/210324eagle-population.php</link>
      <description>WASHINGTON –&amp;#160;Populations of the American bald eagle — the bold national symbol of the United States — have quadrupled since 2009, according to a new report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners. Bald eagles once teetered on the brink of extinction, reaching an all-time low of 417 known nesting pairs in 1963 in the lower 48 states. However, after decades of protection, the banning of the pesticide DDT, and conservation efforts with numerous partners, the bald eagle population has flourished, growing to more than 71,400 nesting pairs.</description>

      <title>The worst so-called “best practice” for Docker</title>
      <link>https://pythonspeed.com/articles/security-updates-in-docker/</link>
      <description>Somebody is always wrong on the Internet, and bad Docker packaging advice is quite common. But one particular piece of advice keeps coming up, and it’s dangerous enough to merit its own article. In a whole bunch of places you will be told not to install security updates when building your Docker image. This advice is given by the official Docker docs’ best practices page: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images cannot upgrade inside an unprivileged container. To be clear: RUN commands happen during image build, not during container startup. The documentation there is saying “build your images without installing security updates”. You’ll see the same advice in the hadolint Dockerfile linter (it cites the above), and you’ll even see it in the OWASP Docker cheatsheet: Avoid the use of apt/apk upgrade For the vast majority of people creating Dockerfiles this is absolutely awful advice. And since this bad advice is so common, let’s consider some of the justifications and why they are wrong.</description>

      <title>Do Not Split</title>
      <link>https://fieldofvision.org/do-not-split</link>
      <description>Told from within the heart of the Hong Kong protests, “Do Not Split” begins in 2019 as a proposed bill allowing the Chinese government to extradite criminal suspects to mainland China escalated protests throughout Hong Kong. Unfolding across a year, “Do Not Split” captures the determination and sacrifices of the protesters, the government’s backlash, and the passage of the new Beijing-backed national security law.</description>

      <title>Closing web browser windows doesn&amp;#39;t close connections</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/closing.html</link>
      <description>Months ago I noticed something strange in the Little Snitch Network Monitor: Safari was still connecting to web sites after every window had been closed. At the time, I thought this was just a Safari bug. I brought the issue to the attention of some Safari engineers, who I had hoped would look into it. Since then, Safari has seen several software updates, and recently I remembered to check again to see whether the issue was resolved. Unfortunately I could still reproduce it, so I decided to investigate further. To my horror, I discovered that Chrome and Firefox were doing it too. That&amp;#39;s too much a coincidence to be a bug, right? Could it be that web browsers are keeping open connections after windows are closed on purpose? If you don&amp;#39;t have Little Snitch installed on the Mac (you should!), you can still see the open (ESTABLISHED) connections using the lsof (list open files) command-line tool in Terminal:</description>

PlaywrightSharp is a .Net library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API. Playwright delivers automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast. On May 2020, Microsoft introduced Playwright - an open-source Node.js library to write cross-browser automation tests - that are fast, reliable and capable.

Playwright takes the basic Puppeteer architecture and moves it more in the direction of Selenium, adding a web automation framework and improving how Puppeteer interacts with page content. As mentioned earlier it is a Node.js library. There is no direct way you can use Node.js apps from .NET. PlaywrightSharp is a nuget package which a C# binding of Playwright library.</description>
