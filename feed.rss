      <title>Fixing the problem of too many tabs</title>
      <link>https://carl.duevel.online/blog/desktop/</link>
      <description>Tab mayhem and windows inflation  How many browser tabs are open on your browser right now? Too many to count? Let me guess: Rows and rows of tabs belonging to different research tasks that you want to pick up later. The occasional tab on social network. That store you still have a cart open with that thing you maybe want to buy. Some are still relevant but many are not.</description>

      <description>TL;DR In my opinion, these self-hosted, open-source applications are the best of what open-source can be.
 Home Assistant Jellyfin Pi-hole Nextcloud WordPress  Introduction My hot water tank recently leaked, but (luckily for me) there was a floor drain right next to it. The next day (after having the tank fixed), I purchased a water leak sensor, added it to Home Assistant in under 2 minutes, and was able to get push notifications of future detected leaks.</description>

      <title>The Simple Joy of Learning to Play Piano</title>
      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/the-simple-joy-of-learning-to-play-piano/</link>
      <description>Back in January, I started to teach myself how to play piano. I&amp;#39;d played before when I was a kid — like many people do — but I was never very good and it didn&amp;#39;t stick once I&amp;#39;d stopped taking lessons. I&amp;#39;d had a keyboard for years, stowed away at my parent&amp;#39;s place, but I&amp;#39;d rarely ever used it. I had occasionally tried to pick up piano over the years, but just like when I was a kid: it didn&amp;#39;t stick.</description>

      <title>Modern Python performance considerations</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/893686/8978976335696804/</link>
      <description>There is a lot of work going on right now on speeding up Python; Kevin
Modzelewski gave a presentation at 
PyCon 2022 on some of that
work.  Much of it has implications for Python programmers in terms of how
to best take advantage of these optimizations in their code.  He gave an
overview of some of the projects, the kinds of optimizations being worked
on, and provided some benchmarks to give a general idea of how much faster
various Python implementations are getting—and which operations are most affected.</description>

      <description>A group of users were trying to implement a simple, terminal-based video game and found the performance under Windows Terminal to be entirely unsuitable for such a task. The performance issue could be replicated by repeatedly drawing a “rainbow” and measuring how many frames per second (FPS) we can achieve.</description>

      <description>A growing number of Visual Studio customers use ultra-wide monitors today. Ultra-wide means wider than a traditional 16:9 widescreen display – usually 3440&amp;#215;1440 or larger resolution. They seem to be gaining popularity among developers and I’m curious how Visual Studio can use all this extra space.</description>
