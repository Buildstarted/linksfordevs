      <title>Cloudflare 1.1.1.1  Incident on July 14, 2025</title>
      <link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1-1-1-1-incident-on-july-14-2025/</link>
      <description>On July 14th, 2025, Cloudflare made a change to our service topologies that caused an outage for 1.1.1.1 on the edge, resulting in downtime for 62 minutes for customers using the 1.1.1.1 public DNS Resolver as well as intermittent degradation of service for Gateway DNS.

Weâ€™re deeply sorry for this outage.

This outage was the result of an internal configuration error and not the result of an attack or a BGP hijack. In this blog post, weâ€™re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what weâ€™re doing to make sure this doesnâ€™t happen again.</description>

      <title>Death by a thousand slops</title>
      <link>https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/</link>
      <description>I have previously blogged about the relatively new trend of AI slop in vulnerability reports submitted to curl and how it hurts and exhausts us. This trend does not seem to slow down. On the contrary, it seems that we have recently not only received more AI slop but also more human slop. The latter â€¦ Continue reading Death by a thousand slops â†’</description>
