      <link>https://yagizdegirmenci.com/posts/open-source-is-not-free-software/</link>
      <description>There is a big misconception, open source is not free software. This post on Hacker News made me realize that better. Being an open source developer is hard.
Open source is an incredible thing. We all use it, but rarely think about what would happen if it were gone, probably you will be spending %90 of your time reinventing the wheel, we should be grateful for what we have now. But from the view of open source developers, they have expectations.</description>

learning and for whom the task of reading a paper with a ‘bad’
mathematical style might seem a daunting prospect. Without further ado,
here are some suggestions for improving your research article.1</description>
