      <title>Disclosure: Yet another macOS privacy protections bypass</title>
      <link>https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/disclosure3.html</link>
      <description>Today I&amp;#39;m disclosing a macOS privacy protections bypass. I discovered that an application can use the venerable Unix command-line tool &amp;quot;ls&amp;quot; (list directory contents) to bypass both TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) and the sandbox, enabling unauthorized access to file metadata in directories that are supposed to be protected. This issue remains unaddressed in the latest public versions of Big Sur, Catalina, and Mojave, and is therefore, in one sense, a zero-day. Here is the timeline leading to my disclosure:</description>

      <title>Learn C# with CSharpFritz - Ep11: New Features in C# 9</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htB7ohlaYKk</link>
      <description>.NET 5 is released and C# 9 is here!  Let&amp;#39;s talk about the new features of C# 9 and tinker with some code to see how it can benefit our applications.

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:05:49 - Why use C# over C++?
00:08:44 - How do you configure .NET3.1 and .NET5 to work side by side on a Linux server? 
00:10:39 - Is C# a good gateway development language into others?
00:12:16 - Does C# 9 produce code that is more efficient just by recompiling applications?
00:13:35 - Is VB at the same level of C# ?
00:15:24 - Is the syntactic sugar C# 9 brings bad for performance?
00:24:26 - Can I still use .NET Standard dlls with .NET 5?
00:34:39 - Does the constructor/assignment syntax work on a normal class as well?
00:37:38 - Could you say a Record type sugarcoats Class types?
00:39:37 - Is C#9 support going to be exclusive to .NET 5
00:40:44 - Are the any breaking changes from C#8 to C#9?
00:42:49 - Is there a way to use C#9 on UWP?
00:55:59 - Are generics supported with record types?
00:57:13 - Are records and anonymous objects related in any ways?
01:02:13 - Can you have init and set defined separately?
01:05:14 - Can you use backing fields with init?
01:12:50 - What if you have two files with top-level statements in a project?
01:13:48 - Do you lose the ability to pass in arguments with top-level statements?
01:16:16 - When would you use top-level statements and not a unit test project?
01:17:57 - How we can execute top-level statements from other files/classes/methods?

      <description>I’m an actor and a model. I star in gay adult films. I remember after my first shoot, my director said to me you should start an Only Fans and a Twitter as good marketing. (It was mostly for him to sell the films.) I remember being perplexed about posting adult content to Twitter and having absolutely no idea what Only Fans was! I’m also a web developer by day so, being more familiar with Twitter, I went that route. So, I started making amateur homemade porn and posting it to my Twitter account.</description>

      <title>Real-time Data fetching with GraphQL and Blazor</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDAYdrFHqGU</link>
      <description>GraphQL supports the ability to subscribe to event streams to enable somewhat real-time scenarios for both clients and servers.

In this episode of the On .NET show, HotChocolate author Michael Staib returns to show us how to enable real-time data fetching with GraphQL using subscriptions .

[T02:02] - What is real-time data fetching?
[T04:30] - What are subscriptions used for?
[T05:48] - Setting up a GraphQL client in Blazor (Demo)
[T10:55] - Updating the GraphQL schema with fragments 
[T16:38] - Updating the Razor components 
[T24:48] - Using GraphQL variables
[T28:18] - Adding subscriptions

      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY7OJHKVjEo</link>
      <description>Don&amp;#39;t build an upload widget yourself! Uppy provides an extremely powerful upload widget with just a few lines of code. You can import images from your webcam, a URL, your computer, and tons of other services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and much more!

In this video, we&amp;#39;ll use Uppy to upload images to a Node/Express server. Then, we&amp;#39;ll use the Multer package to create Express.js middleware that will save the image to our local storage.
