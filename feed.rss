      <title>Streamlining the creation of new Rails applications with templates</title>
      <link>http://adbatista.github.io/2025/05/25/templates.html</link>
      <description>In one of the clients I’ve worked on, they had several projects. In the process of extracting parts of the legacy project, they had a document with the gems that would be used according to the type of project, whether it was an API, if it had authentication, if it would call other APIs, or would have background processing. Every new project had a separate Dockerfile, GitHub actions configuration, Rubocop configuration, Brakeman, issue templates, etc.</description>

      <title>Getting Gemini to write an ORM for Spanner in a weekend</title>
      <link>https://suyogs.com/p/getting-gemini-to-write-an-orm-for-spanner-in-a-weekend/</link>
      <description>Recently, I wanted to get a Bun application working with Google Spanner. While Google provides a client library for Spanner (@google-cloud/spanner), the JavaScript (Node.js/Bun) ecosystem lacks a dedicated Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) specifically designed for Spanner’s native Google SQL dialect. This gap prompted an experiment: could Google’s Gemini assist in rapidly developing one? This post details that journey and introduces spanner-orm, a Google SQL ORM in Bun largely created with AI help over a weekend.</description>

      <description>The story starts in Crosscord, the crossword Discord server. Over 5,000 users strong, the server has emerged as a central hub for the online crossword community, a buzzing, sometimes overwhelming, sometimes delightful town square where total noobs, veteran constructors, and champion solvers alike come together to talk about words that cross each other.</description>
