      <description>I&amp;#39;ve given a good look into the future of developing WordPress websites, and there&amp;#39;s no question that the future is Block Themes with Full Site Editing given how much the WordPress team invests effort into that. That said, I have a few issues with the current iteration of that.</description>

      <link>https://jameshfisher.com/2024/03/20/it-might-not-need-a-label/</link>
      <description>One hallmark of “programmer UI” is using labels for everything. Here I show why this is often a design mistake, with some examples. I suggest how to identify over-labelling, and how to fix it. Finally I suggest why programmers are biased towards this design mistake.</description>

      <title>Knee Deep in tree-sitter Queries</title>
      <link>https://parsiya.net/blog/knee-deep-tree-sitter-queries/</link>
      <description>tree-sitter is a parser generator. You can use it to parse source code which
is the first step of static analysis. For example, GitHub uses it to highlight
code, code navigation, and also in CodeQL extractors.
TL;DR: Queries are great for capturing text from code. But to extract
anything moderately structured we need to traverse the syntax tree.
And, yes, the title is based on Doom Episode 1 Knee Deep in the Dead.
I love the title (and the game), because it let&amp;#39;s me relive my edgy days.</description>

      <title>Open-source is a chainsaw</title>
      <link>https://ergaster.org/posts/2024/03/20-open-source-chainsaw/</link>
      <description>Open-source is popular among software engineers and has been for decades. But far from a silver bullet that automatically makes everything better, open-source is a double-edged sword. It can make wonderful, sustainable projects or break the teams behind them. I care about people, the power dynamics in society, and my field of work&amp;#39;s impact on them. But what is open-source in the first place? What does it bring to the table? How can it backfire? And why do I think that software that impacts the general public&amp;#39;s lives should be open-source?</description>

      <title>The Dashboard</title>
      <link>https://mchow.com/thoughts/the-dashboard/</link>
      <description>Here, all of it! Click the buttons, expand the dropdowns, fill the inputs, multi-select one or two or three onto the graph, with its period in days or weeks or months (your choice), not this tab but the next, the next, or wait no the hamburger.
Every insight there, the keen with the mundane, interspersed for your pleasure—the needle is yours but first the haystack. It can’t be made a slide deck, a slide deck could never capture the sheer interactive power of dashboard.</description>

      <title>Why does an extraneous build step make my Zig app 10x faster?</title>
      <link>https://mtlynch.io/zig-extraneous-build/</link>
      <description>
    
      For the past few months, I’ve been curious about two technologies: the Zig programming language and Ethereum cryptocurrency. To learn more about both, I’ve been using Zig to write a bytecode interpreter for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Zig is a great language for performance optimization, as it gives you fine-grained control over memory and control flow. To motivate myself, I’ve been benchmarking my Ethereum implementation against the official Go implementation.

      <title>Execution is King</title>
      <link>https://n9o.xyz/posts/202403-execution-is-king/</link>
      <description>As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up _ideas_ and _execution_ in discussions. Both these concepts have entirely unique levels of fidelity to what the finished product will be. It’s important for Product Managers to know the difference between these two concepts, how to manage them, and what importance they should have at different stages of the product development cycle. Not understanding the differences between an _idea_ and an _execution_ isn&amp;#39;t just a minor inconvenience; it&amp;#39;s a significant obstacle to innovation and strategic execution for products and companies. </description>

      <description>One of my favorite features in Neovim is the Tree-sitter integration.
It allows for fast syntax highlighting that works well even in an error state (often the case when you’re editing code), and it has additional semantics (you can differentiate between function parameters and local variables).</description>
