      <link>https://mathieu.fenniak.net/testtrim-2025-01-nested-syscall-tracing/</link>
      <description>Today, we’re going to deep-dive into the kind of thing you can only “invest” time on if you’re a single engineer working on a project with no supervision. I just finished a crazy complicated development effort in my project, testtrim, and all I want to do is talk about how surprised I am that it actually worked.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Moat</title>
      <link>https://wq6e.com/posts/2025-01-24_openai-isnt-unique/</link>
      <description>OpenAI has long held the belief that they have a unique position in the market and therefore a very wide and deep moat protecting them from any competition coming along and eating their lunch. That moat, seemingly, is due only to the massive and ever-increasing cost of training one of their AI models. Their belief, then, was that they were so far ahead of everyone else and had so much more capital available to them that they could withstand any onslaught and simply outspend the competition. They could therefore justify any capital expenditure as a means to keep the moat filled and sustain their market “leadership”.
That’s all changed in the past few weeks.</description>

      <title>Compressing By Writing</title>
      <link>https://lifeandmoneyandscience.oliverpartridge.workers.dev/2025-01-19~Vectors-and-added-value</link>
      <description>Money is a token. The token represents quantified work that added value. This value is qualitative in nature, but to tokenize it, we link human perception of that value to a number we call price. Price is the numerical representation of how humans perceive the utility or impact of added value in the real world.</description>

      <title>Running NATS on a FreeBSD Jail</title>
      <link>https://simonevellei.com/blog/posts/running-nats-on-a-freebsd-jail/</link>
      <description>Last few months I played with FreeBSD and my Rock64 embedded boards [1] [2]. I really enjoyed the experience and I wanted to go to the next level and experiment with FreeBSD jails. I was surprised how easy (and logical) it was to create and manage an isolated environment. I also noticed that the low level commands have been wrapped into a more user friendly interfaces (like bastille) making the whole experience more enjoyable.</description>

      <title>Things I learned building a model validation library – Wilsons Blog</title>
      <link>https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/01/24/things-i-learned-building-a-model-validation-library/</link>
      <description>I spent a few years designing and partially building a library used for the validation of front office models at a financial institution, and I thought it might be a good idea to write down what I learned during that time. It was my first ever big project and happened to some degree by accident, building something that I just thought was neat turned into a modest project with its own team. But before we get to all that, let’s first talk briefly about what model validation is.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948</link>
      <description>We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.</description>

      <title>DbContext Pooling: The Secret Sauce to Faster EF Core Apps - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/dbcontext-pooling-the-secret-sauce-to-faster-ef-core-apps/</link>
      <description>Imagine you’re running a restaurant. Every time a customer orders, you buy a brand-new frying pan, use it once, and toss it out. Sounds absurd, right? But that’s essentially what happens in EF Core when you create a new DbContext for every request. It’s wasteful, slow, and totally unnecessary. Enter DbContext Pooling: the genius way to reuse those frying pans—err, contexts—and turbocharge your app’s performance.</description>
