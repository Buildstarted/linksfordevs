      <title>Word-As-Image for Semantic Typography</title>
      <link>https://wordasimage.github.io/Word-As-Image-Page/</link>
      <description>Our word-as-image illustrations concentrate on changing only the geometry of the letters to
                convey the meaning.
                We deliberately do not change color or texture and do not use embellishments.
                This allows simple, concise, black-and-white designs that convey the semantics clearly.

                We rely on the prior of a pretrained Stable Diffusion model to connect between text and images, and utilize
                the Score Distillation Sampling approach to encourage the appearance of the letter to reflect the
                provided textual concept.

                Given an input word, our method is applied separately for each letter.

                We represent each letter as a closed vectorized shape.</description>

      <title>Word-As-Image for Semantic Typography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01818</link>
      <description>A word-as-image is a semantic typography technique where a word illustration
presents a visualization of the meaning of the word, while also preserving its
readability. We present a method to create word-as-image illustrations
automatically. This task is highly challenging as it requires semantic
understanding of the word and a creative idea of where and how to depict these
semantics in a visually pleasing and legible manner. We rely on the remarkable
ability of recent large pretrained language-vision models to distill textual
concepts visually. We target simple, concise, black-and-white designs that
convey the semantics clearly. We deliberately do not change the color or
texture of the letters and do not use embellishments. Our method optimizes the
outline of each letter to convey the desired concept, guided by a pretrained
Stable Diffusion model. We incorporate additional loss terms to ensure the
legibility of the text and the preservation of the style of the font. We show
high quality and engaging results on numerous examples and compare to
alternative techniques.</description>

      <title>Imperative code is simpler than functional code! No, not at all, but you are more used to it. – planetgeek.ch</title>

      <description>A myth about F# that I hear repeatedly is that imperative code (e.g. loops) is simpler than functional code (e.g. folds). On one hand, simplicity is very subjective. On the other hand, simplicity is mostly determined by familiarity.</description>

      <description>Reading Future Internet PKI schemes need to be bootstrapped through web
PKI I was
reminded by all the problems I’ve had with SSH (Secure SHell) PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure). SSH host verification is trust-on-first-use (TOFU). So SSH is
protected from man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks unless the first connection
falls prey to the attack.</description>
