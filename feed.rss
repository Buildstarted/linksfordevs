      <title>Random and fixed routes with Apache APISIX</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/fixed-routes-apisix/</link>
      <description>My ideas for blog posts inevitably start to dry up after over two years at Apache APISIX. Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:     We have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I’ll give an example for better understanding.   We have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html a</description>

      <title>Why today&amp;#39;s phones are so boooooring?</title>
      <link>https://andreyor.st/posts/2024-06-11-why-todays-phones-are-so-boooooring/</link>
      <description>So, here’s a question - when were you last excited for a new phone? Well, I mean really excited?
Here’s the thing. Phones are so boring today that most retail stores show you the backside of the phone. Because from the front they all look exactly the same.</description>

      <title>Why Search is not a solved problem yet</title>
      <link>https://anilturaga.github.io/posts/search_ux/</link>
      <description>Nearly 35 years has passed from the advent of search engines.
With 90% of the market share, Google search’s user experience has been relatively stagnant for a long time barring the recent AI Overviews feature. Most of the alternatives till a couple of years ago were still mimicking Google search experience but with more privacy guarantees and better control over ranking.
With the recent breakthrough in Generative AI and some new solutions gaining traction, Search offerings now can be broadly bifurcated into two types:</description>

      <title>the how and the why</title>
      <link>https://sarahendren.com/2024/06/10/the-how-and-the-why/</link>
      <description>This is likely to be the first in a series of meditations on the college decision-making process. My two younger kids are embarking on the process now, so I’m thinking about the subject personally; my job as a professor means I’m thinking about it in my workplace, too. And I hardly need to say that the big questions are in the zeitgeist after this academic year: What kind of four-year experiences are worth paying for? What’s available in that developmental window that can be nurtured and drawn out in young people? For people who go to college, that period is one of the hinge moments to adulthood that can be life-changing in lasting ways. How should a parent think about it?</description>

      <title>What is Idempotency? - AsyncMonolith Docs</title>
      <link>https://timmoth.github.io/AsyncMonolith/posts/idempotency/</link>
      <description>Idempotency refers to the ability of an operation to be performed multiple times whilst still yielding the same outcome. It is a critical property of handlers in an event driven system, since events can be reprocessed due to retries, network issues, or other failures. Without idempotency, reprocessing the same event could lead to inconsistent states, duplicate entries, or other unintended side effects.</description>

      <description>Every software engineer can have a great blog, if they want to.
Many of us start blogs, but most of those blogs lie abandoned or sporadically updated.
It&amp;#39;s okay if you start blogging and figure out it&amp;#39;s not really for you.
But there are also some common issues that block people who want to write a blog for fun or to improve as a writer1.</description>

Error handling is an inevitable part of software development. Traditionally, exceptions are the primary method for signaling that something has gone awry. However, the exception mechanism is fraught with issues: unpredictable control flow, performance bottlenecks, and challenges in debugging.

      <title>Blog - Private Cloud Compute: A new frontier for AI privacy in the cloud - Apple Security Research</title>
      <link>https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/</link>
      <description>Secure and private AI processing in the cloud poses a formidable new challenge. To support advanced features of Apple Intelligence with larger foundation models, we created Private Cloud Compute (PCC), a groundbreaking cloud intelligence system designed specifically for private AI processing. Built with custom Apple silicon and a hardened operating system, Private Cloud Compute extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud, making sure that personal user data sent to PCC isn’t accessible to anyone other than the user — not even to Apple. We believe Private Cloud Compute is the most advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI compute at scale.</description>
