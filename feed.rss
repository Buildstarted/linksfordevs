      <title>Tracking Every Change: Using SaveChanges Interception for EF Core Auditing - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/tracking-every-change-using-savechanges-interception-for-ef-core-auditing/</link>
      <description>Ever wonder who changed what and when in your database? Or maybe you’ve had that “uh-oh” moment where data was updated, but no one knows how? Good news: EF Core has a built-in way to track changes—without modifying every query manually! SaveChanges Interception lets you hook into EF Core’s SaveChanges() pipeline and log inserts, updates, and deletes automatically.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-R1&amp;#39;s strong zero-shot performance on agentic tasks</title>
      <link>http://krasserm.github.io/2025/02/05/deepseek-r1-agent/</link>
      <description>I ran a quick experiment investigating how DeepSeek-R1 performs on agentic tasks, despite not supporting tool use natively, and I was quite impressed by preliminary results. This experiment runs DeepSeek-R1 in a single-agent setup, where the model not only plans the actions but also formulates the actions as executable Python code. On a subset1 of the GAIA validation split, DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 12.5% absolute, from 53.1% to 65.6% correct, and other models by an even larger margin:</description>

      <title>Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI</link>
      <description>This is a general audience deep dive into the Large Language Model (LLM) AI technology that powers ChatGPT and related products. It is covers the full training stack of how the models are developed, along with mental models of how to think about their &amp;quot;psychology&amp;quot;, and how to get the best use them in practical applications. I have one &amp;quot;Intro to LLMs&amp;quot; video already from ~year ago, but that is just a re-recording of a random talk, so I wanted to loop around and do a lot more comprehensive version.

Instructor
Andrej was a founding member at OpenAI (2015) and then Sr. Director of AI at Tesla (2017-2022), and is now a founder at Eureka Labs, which is building an AI-native school. His goal in this video is to raise knowledge and understanding of the state of the art in AI, and empower people to effectively use the latest and greatest in their work.
