      <description>Here is a link to full schematics.
Thanks to whoever made this.  I just found a few issues with it.
The CLK input to the 7474 on page 2 should be HRESET, not CLK.  Pin 5 of the 555&amp;#39;s on pages 5 and 6 should be connected
to the capacitor.  Also some of the nodes are inconsistently labeled.</description>

      <title>Why are tools such as Docker and Kubernetes written in Go and not C#? : csharp</title>
      <link>https://teddit.pussthecat.org/r/csharp/comments/uxh2oa/why_are_tools_such_as_docker_and_kubernetes/</link>
      <description>A lot of new tools that devs use seem to be written in Go. But why not C#? I know that C# and .Net is more than capable. Is it a lack of that kind of culture? How can we foster a more open source culture because it still seems like a lot of devs have old prejudices towards C# and .Net. I think having more interesting and useful open source tools written in C# would go a long way to change perceptions.</description>

      <link>https://a13xp0p0v.github.io/2022/05/24/pwn-fuchsia.html</link>
      <description>Fuchsia is a general-purpose open-source operating system created by Google. It is based on the Zircon microkernel written in C++ and is currently under active development. The developers say that Fuchsia is designed with a focus on security, updatability, and performance. As a Linux kernel hacker, I decided to take a look at Fuchsia OS and assess it from the attacker&amp;#39;s point of view. This article describes my experiments.</description>

      <description>While I was leading PKC’s security practice, we did probably 20-30 code security audits, almost of all of them for startups that were just around their Series A or B (that was usually when they had cash and realized that it’d be good to take a deeper look at their security, after the do-or-die focus on product market fit).</description>

      <description>Just now, I took a look at the HTTP logs on git.sr.ht. Of the past 100,000 HTTP
requests received by git.sr.ht (representing about 2&amp;#189; hours of logs), 4,774 have
been requested by GoModuleProxy — 5% of all traffic. And their requests
are not cheap: every one is a complete git clone. They come in bursts, so every
few minutes we get a big spike from Go, along with a constant murmur of Go
traffic.</description>
