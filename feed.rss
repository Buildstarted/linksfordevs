offers $30,000 more in base pay per year more than Company B, most people will
choose Company A.</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/access-linux-filesystems-in-windows-and-wsl-2/</link>

      <title>Why it is Important that Software Projects Fail</title>
      <link>https://www.berglas.org/Articles/ImportantThatSoftwareFails/ImportantThatSoftwareFails.html</link>
      <description>Some put this down to organizational culture.  If an engineer were
to deliberately under specify a load bearing beam in order to cut

domains are fundamentally different.  But all commentators
assume that failure is detrimental to society.  This paper sets out to
correct that misunderstanding.</description>
