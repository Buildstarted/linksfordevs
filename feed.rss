      <title>I Fixed My Slow App Using Sentry Trace Explorer!!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=U4BkIfj_CYw</link>
      <description>Try out Sentry Tracing free for your application, and get 3 months free: https://dub.sh/sentry-milan
Get the source code for this video for FREE ‚Üí https://the-dotnet-weekly.kit.com/sentry

Want to master Clean Architecture? Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ
Want to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt

In this video, you'll learn how to integrate Sentry with your ASP.NET Core microservices to gain full visibility into distributed systems. We'll walk through configuring the Sentry SDK using OpenTelemetry, setting up tracing, and solving real-world observability challenges like performance bottlenecks, error propagation, and black box communication between services.

üìå What you'll learn:

- How to configure Sentry in .NET using Sentry.AspNetCore and Sentry.OpenTelemetry
- How to trace requests across microservices using Sentry‚Äôs Trace Explorer
- How to debug N+1 problems and API slowdowns using distributed traces
- How to investigate exceptions and trace them across services
- How to use telemetry data to validate fixes in production

We‚Äôll walk through a real eShop microservices system involving an order flow, product validation, and background processing. You'll see how Sentry can pinpoint issues like slow API calls and trace failures back to their root cause‚Äîeven across asynchronous service boundaries.

      <title>New Study: Waymo is reducing serious crashes and making streets safer for those most at risk</title>
      <link>https://waymo.com/blog/2025/05/waymo-making-streets-safer-for-vru</link>
      <description>The path to Vision Zero requires reducing severe crashes and improving the safety of those most at risk. Our latest research paper shows that the Waymo Driver is making significant strides in both areas. By reducing the most dangerous crashes and providing better protection for pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users, Waymo is making streets safer in cities where it operates.</description>

      <title>Jonathan Peppers Unleashes Code Chaos: How .NET Meets the NES</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=EyACUmH8AH4</link>
      <description>RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.

 Show Notes "When you program for the NES you deeply need to understand the hardware, right. And that's not a thing; like as a .NET developer you don't really know what a register is, or like or a bus, or like NES has a thing called a PPU"‚Äî Jonathan Peppers

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, Jonathan Peppers joins us to talk about something which is a little out of the ordinary for us here: programming the Nintendo Entertainment System but in C#. We talk about the process behind his (some would say absurd) idea for an AOT transpiler which can convert a subset of C# over to the Assembler required to write and publish a NES game.

 "So you think about that example, what I described there on the NES side is actually very similar to what's on the IL side, is that in IL, you have a string, right? It goes and looks up in a string table, the contents of the string, and puts it on a stack, and then it calls vram_write, and then it's the runtimes job to actually like make that happen at runtime; or in the case of an AOT compiler it would emit, you know, native machine code that does the same thing."‚Äî Jonathan Peppers

 Along the way, we talk about that Ahead-of-Time compilation is, have a brief intro to what IL is (that's what your C# code is compiled to before running it), and how all of that fits in with .NES‚Äîthe wonderful name for Jon's AOT NES compiler.

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

      <title>Third Party Cookies Must Be Removed</title>
      <link>https://w3ctag.github.io/web-without-3p-cookies/</link>
      <description>Third-party (AKA cross-site) cookies are harmful to the web, and must be removed from the web platform. This finding explains why they must be removed, and examines the challenges in removing them. We highlight some use cases that depend on third-party cookies and offer some examples of designed-for-purpose technologies that can replace them. Specification authors are expected to ensure they do not undermine the benefits of removing third-party cookies when proposing new web platform technologies.</description>
