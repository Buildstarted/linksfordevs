      <title>Classic 3D videogame shadow techniques</title>
      <link>https://30fps.net/pages/videogame-shadows/</link>
      <description>Towards the end of Wim Wenders’s excellent Perfect Days, the protagonist Hirayama is drinking beer under a bridge after he has seen a Businessman courting his crush. Suddenly the Businessman joins him under the bridge. As it turns out, things aren’t actually that simple but the point is their conversation takes them to some fundamental questions:</description>

      <title>Synchronous buck converter for 12V/5A output</title>
      <link>https://tomscii.sig7.se/2024/10/Synchronous-buck-converter-12V5A</link>
      <description>What is the logical next step after making a linear
regulator? I learned some valuable lessons
(both regarding general electronics and power supplies) doing that
project, so I believe I could now make a much better linear
supply. And perhaps I will! But now I decided it was time to aim for a
switch-mode power supply (SMPS), a.k.a DC/DC converter.</description>

      <title>The Intelligence of Noetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://gelinasjames.com/the-intelligence-of-noetic-fields/</link>
      <description>Alan Briskin and I are working on a book about “fields.” I have written several previous posts about them. The map to this territory is becoming clearer and more detailed as we, along with David Sibbet, Gisela Wendling, Karen Buckley, and Philip Bakerlaar share our ideas and experiences&amp;#160; about and with fields. We are also investigating the work of those who have explored social fields before us like Mary Parker Follett, Kurt Lewin, Pierre Bourdieu, David Bohm, Lynne McTaggart, and Otto Scharmer. The following piece is an adaptation of writings and conversations between Alan and myself.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I wrote   Learning and Reviewing System Internals - Tactics and Psychology  .

      <title>4 Things I Would Do DIFFERENTLY In My Software Engineering Journey</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=jC0fJ2PCaeA</link>
      <description>Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be cool if you had a time machine?!

Well -- unfortunately that&amp;#39;s not an option.

But what IS an option is sharing lessons that can help others! You might not be able to help yourself directly, but you can help others from your experiences.

In this video, I share 4 things that I would do differently in my software engineering journey if I were to do it again.
