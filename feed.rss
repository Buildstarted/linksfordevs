      <title>Privacy Is A Myth. Unless You&amp;#39;re Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs</title>
      <link>https://illya.sh/blog/posts/privacy-is-a-myth-without-zero-knowledge-proofs/</link>
      <description>Privacy is a fundamental human right, yet digital privacy is a myth. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) turn this myth into reality, by enabling inherently private data sharing through a verifiable computation model. Discover how ZK solutions like zkLocus, zkSafeZones, zkML, zkVM, Merkle Trees, MPC, and homomorphic encryption, enable privacy in all digita products - from search engines and social networks to e-commerce and 24/7 global surveillance, without compromising functionality or individual privacy.</description>

      <title>My $2.2k laptop can&amp;#39;t drive two screens</title>
      <link>https://notes.nokun.eu/post/2024-05-26-expensive-laptops-dont-pro/</link>
      <description>I received a new MacBook Pro 14&amp;quot; M3 from my employer, which starts at €2.049 ($2224) in Italy. It looks like a solid machine, at least physically speaking. I wired it up to my fairly basic dual-monitor office setup, just to realize that confusingly enough, I could not use the HDMI and USB-C port at the same time.
I thought that was a cable issue, then a bug, but nope. It turns out the “base” M3 chip is essentially an overclocked iPad chip put into a computer, and it does not have two display controllers.</description>

      <title>Jonas Hietala: Autocomplete with nvim-cmp</title>
      <link>https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/05/26/autocomplete_with_nvim-cmp/</link>
      <description>Autocompletion is an absurdly powerful feature that I—and I must assume most programmers—use all the time.
It’s not as crucial for writing blog posts as when you’re coding but it’s still easy to come up with examples of how autocomplete would help.
For example:</description>

      <title>Cloudflare took down our website after trying to force us to pay 120k$ within 24h</title>
      <link>https://robindev.substack.com/p/cloudflare-took-down-our-website</link>
      <description>TL;DR: We&amp;#39;ve been on the Cloudflare Business plan ($250/month) for years. They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly &amp;quot;purged&amp;quot; all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</description>

      <link>https://kenthendricks.com/99-cent-prices/</link>
      <description>I once worked at a company that priced everything with a .95 ending. The bestselling software package was $999.95. Add-on products were $9.95, or $19.95, or $49.95. Everything ended with a .95. It had been this way for more than twenty years. One day, one of the VPs suggested we change all prices to end […]</description>

This came from the somewhat outdated understanding that the barrier of entry into programming was mentally taxing and required fucking around with compiling, development environment et al.</description>
