      <title>Event Driven applications on Kubernetes with KEDA</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMGcaUjBk90</link>
      <description>KEDA is an open source project and enables event-driven autoscaling for Kubernetes workloads.KEDA&amp;#160;scalers&amp;#160;can detect if a deployment should be activated or deactivated, and feed custom metrics for a specific event source.

In this episode, our friend Jeff Hollan joins Cecil to show us how we can use KEDA to scale out our .NET applications running on Kubernetes

[00:00] - Intro
[01:15] - What is KEDA?
[03:38] - KEDA’s relationship with Azure Functions
[05:53] - Moving KEDA to the CNCF
[08:40] - .NET Worker service demo
[12:44] - Supported Keda triggers
[14:37] - Working with ACI and Virtual Kubelets
[17:09] - Does KEDA work alongside other Kubernetes projects?
[18:45] - Getting started with KEDA

      <title>On .NET Live - Operationalizing ML models with ONNX, C# .... and Pokemon!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBWqK-mDWSU</link>
      <description>ONNX defines a common set of operators and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

In this live session, Cassie Breviu shows us how we can reuse existing machine learning models using .NET and ONNX. We&amp;#39;ll actually use a model that can classify wine quality based on the description from a wine magazine!
