      <title>Security through obscurity isn't / Matiss Treinis</title>
      <link>https://matisstreinis.com/posts/security_through_obscurity_isnt/</link>
      <description>There has been a couple of posts (1, 2) on Reddit discussing an article Security by Obscurity is Underrated by Utku Şen.
Before going any further, you should probably read the linked article. In conclusion, however, the author makes a point that -
 Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning, non-Markov environments, and memory</title>
      <link>https://flowing.systems/2020/09/15/reinforcement-learning-non-markov-memory.html</link>
      <description>I recently finished reading a reinforcement learning textbook (by Barto and Sutton), and throughout it I was constantly vexed by one important assumption that underlined all the algorithms: the Markov property, stating that a succeeding event depends only on the one preceding it, and not on ones far in the past. This kind of restriction is a helpful tool both practically and theoretically, but it causes problems when dealing with a rather natural situation where there is long-term dependence between events. The book doesn’t address this, so I tried to, and found out it’s a genuine problem with real research behind it. Here’s what I did.</description>

      <title>Searching for style</title>
      <link>https://jacobjackson.com/searching-for-style/</link>
      <description>It’s interesting to watch young children use home assistants. They treat them like people, asking questions like “Alexa, how are you feeling?” and “Alexa, where are you?”. I often wonder what their motivation is. Maybe they don’t know the responses are scripted. Maybe the designers’ choice of which response to script is just as interesting to them as a human’s response would be.
Adults are no less inclined to anthropomorphization—Alexa is marketed as a her and not an it—but they’ve grown used to Alexa’s shortcomings as a conversationalist.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16138-3</link>
      <description>Preclinical evidence suggests that a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) can make cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy, while protecting normal cells. In this randomized phase II clinical trial of 131 patients with HER2 negative early stage breast cancer, the authors demonstrate that FMD is safe and enhances the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on radiological and pathological tumor response.</description>

      <title>Settings Sync in Visual Studio Code - IT's BUILT IN NOW!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsq39DEgZ8</link>
      <description>You no longer have to download the Settings Sync extension in Visual Studio Code. Settings Sync is now built in to VS Code, and it works even better than the extension.

      <title>Embarrassing product names averted: Windows Embedded POS and Windows 10 for Advanced PCs | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200915-00/?p=104220</link>
      <description>Windows Embedded for point of sale systems is not called Windows Embedded POS, even though POS is the the industry standard acronym for the term point of sale. Because in the English language, POS is also a slang acronym for something much less complimentary.</description>

      <title>Moment.js | Docs</title>
      <link>https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/</link>
      <description>Moment.js has been successfully used in millions of projects, and we are happy to have contributed to making date and time better on the web.
As of September 2020, Moment gets over 12 million downloads per week!  However, Moment was built for the previous era of the JavaScript ecosystem.
The modern web looks much different these days.  Moment has evolved somewhat over the years, but it has essentially the same design as it did when it was created in 2011.
Given how many projects depend on it, we choose to prioritize stability over new features.</description>

      <title>Don't get burned by missing await Calls for Async Code in ASP.NET Core Middleware</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2020/Sep/14/Dont-get-burned-by-missing-await-Calls-for-Async-Code-in-ASPNET-Core-Middleware</link>
      <description>I recently got burned in an upgraded ASP.NET Core server application where a missing `await` statement caused wildly inconsistent and puzzling output failures. While a simple thing to avoid, once introduced it's possible to live with this error for some time before it manifests. In this post I show a scenario where a missing `await` was causing infrequent HTTP response errors, even though the client apparently receives a valid response.</description>
