      <title>On .NET Live - Operationalizing ML models with ONNX, C# .... and Pokemon!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBWqK-mDWSU</link>
      <description>ONNX defines a common set of operators and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

In this live session, Cassie Breviu shows us how we can reuse existing machine learning models using .NET and ONNX. We&amp;#39;ll actually use a model that can classify wine quality based on the description from a wine magazine!

      <title>Next.js is the Best React Framework - Authentication, SSR vs CSR, and more!</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH6dq3dcgCk</link>
      <description>Next.js has quickly become my favorite framework for building web applications. It can literally do everything that any other framework can do: SSR, CSR, static pages, incremental static builds, and so much more! I really haven&amp;#39;t found a reason not to use Next js!

In this video, we talk about Next.js and authentication. We talk through different authentication strategies and how to handle them appropriately inside of Next.js.
