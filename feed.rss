      <title>The humor hiding behind &amp;quot;JavaScript error: Semicolon expected&amp;quot; | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20201204-00/?p=104513</link>
      <description>On occasion, I make a typo and get “JavaScript error: Semicolon expected” and I chuckle a little, because JavaScript was designed to make semicolons optional most of the time. When I made this observation, some of my friends were amused because I included the phrase “JavaScript was designed.”</description>
