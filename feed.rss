      <title>Why I’m Losing Trust in Open Source – gibson.ws</title>
      <link>https://gibson.ws/why-im-losing-trust-in-open-source/</link>
      <description>Back when I was starting to code several years ago. I picked up The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric Raymond and I was blown away at the idea of free software. Just in case you are not familiar, free software as in freedom and not free beer. Free software back then was this super radical and idealistic concept where as you make a software product commercial or not, but when you distribute it you include the source code of it. The person who got your product would eventually continue to develop it and it will evolve and continually improve as it gets to many users. You then will be looking at their version of your product and will see how it has grown further. Think of it has a community garden where everyone grows their vegetable and anyone would then take pointers on some of your crops and grow their improved version. Eventually you’ll see where you are doing it wrong by looking at how they tend their garden. This is not necessarily free food for everyone – although it’s common. It’s freedom to copy and use my garden setup so we have bigger crops next harvest time.</description>

      <description>I love a lot of the thinking in functional programming (FP):


	Side-effect free functions - That they do not do hidden things beside doing work on the input and returning output
	Referential transparency of functions - A bit of the same as above, that what you put in to a function plus the function</description>

      <description>Intellij IDEA has been an amazing professional-grade IDE for the last 20 years. However, as computer programs evolve, so must the IDE keep pace to remain a useful tool. major IDE evolutions as I see:  2000s: using AST to represent text and building features around that. Intellij nailed this.  2010s:</description>

      <title>Prodoscore: The Bleak Future of Work</title>
      <link>https://blog.dennissauve.com/posts/2021-02-21_prodoscore-the-bleak-future-of-work/</link>
      <description>I recently took a sales pitch from Prodoscore at the behest of a colleague, and now I&amp;#39;m very concerned about
            the future of work. Much in the way that a poor (or even average) credit score can damage and ruin your
            chances
            at some opportunities, so too will a productivity score define your relative worth as an employee by
            reducing
            every aspect of your daily work life into a single number - your &amp;quot;Prodoscore&amp;quot;. The sales pitch of course was
            presented in a light of &amp;quot;helping employers identify &amp;#39;less productive&amp;#39; employees, and give transparency to
            team
            leaders on performance&amp;quot;. At least at first.</description>

      <title>ASP.NET Core in .NET 6 - Part 01 - Overview</title>
      <link>https://asp.net-hacker.rocks/2021/02/22/aspnetcore6-01.html</link>
      <description>.NET 5 was released just about 3 months age and Microsoft announced the first preview of .NET 6 last week. This is really fast. Actually they already started working on .NET 6 before version 5 was released. But it is anyway cool to have a preview available to start playing around. Also the ASP.NET team wrote a new blog post. It is about ASP.NET Core updates on .NET 6. I will take the chance to have more detailed look into the updates and the new feature. I&amp;#39;m going to start a series about those updates and features.</description>

      <title>Whistleblowers: Software Bug Keeping Hundreds Of Inmates In Arizona Prisons Beyond Release Dates</title>
      <link>https://kjzz.org/content/1660988/whistleblowers-software-bug-keeping-hundreds-inmates-arizona-prisons-beyond-release</link>
      <description>According to Arizona Department of Corrections whistleblowers, hundreds of incarcerated people who should be eligible for release are being held in prison because the inmate management software cannot interpret current sentencing laws.KJZZ is not naming the whistleblowers because they fear retaliation. The employees said they have been raising the issue internally for more than a year, but prison administrators have not acted to fix the software bug. The sources said Chief Information Officer Holly Greene and Deputy Director Joe Profiri have been aware of the problem since 2019.</description>

      <description>Go is not an easy programming language. It is simple in many ways: the syntax
is simple, most of the semantics are simple. But a language is more than just
syntax; it’s about doing useful stuff. And doing useful stuff is not always
easy in Go.</description>

      <title>A remote code execution vulnerability in qmail</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/820969/</link>
      <description>Just in case anybody out there is still using qmail: a remote code
execution vulnerability has just been disclosed.  Its CVE number is
CVE-2005-1513 because, as it turns out, the problem was reported 15 years
ago but the fix was refused by the maintainer.
&amp;quot;As a proof of concept, we developed a reliable, local and remote exploit
against Debian&amp;#39;s qmail package in its default configuration. This proof
of concept requires 4GB of disk space and 8GB of memory, and allows an
attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands as any user, except root
(and a few system users who do not own their home directory).&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>Did YouTube block a chess channel over violation of community guideline and usage of racist language? Late last year, a YouTuber who produces popular chess videos found that his channel was blocked over charges of &amp;#39;harmful and dangerous&amp;#39; content.</description>

      <title>Thought Space vs Reality</title>
      <link>https://suketk.com/thought-space-vs-reality</link>
      <description>There are two worlds - the one in our head and the one that is real. It’s easy to conflate the two; perception is reality, the saying goes. But they are separate. Perception is just a representation of reality and as we know, the map is not the territory.</description>

      <title>Managing (side)projects - Bram&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://bram.dingelstad.works/blog/managing-side-projects/</link>
      <description>I’ve always had a soft spot for working on something that I thought was a good idea. I have loved the idea of being a little inventor since I was a kid. Being a programmer that gets to work on all kinds of systems or wants to build a lot of them, I found myself clutching this fantasy every single time when starting another project. But how do I make sense of them? Have I started too many? Why aren’t any of them finished? And why do I feel so demotivated to work on any of them, even though I really want to work on one?</description>

      <title>Tap your phone at Gold Coast bus stops to access my website</title>
      <link>https://joshwithers.blog/2021/02/22/tap-your-phone.html</link>
      <description>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.
That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?
So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</description>
