      <title>Why I'm Breaking Up With Vibe Coding</title>
      <link>https://www.lucasaguiar.xyz/posts/vibe-coding-pitfalls/</link>
      <description>We‚Äôve all been there: headphones on, music pumping, fingers flying across the keyboard, lost in the ‚Äúflow‚Äù with your favorite AI agent. This, my friends, is vibe coding. It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre in the zone, seemingly effortlessly producing code.
It‚Äôs the idea that you can create great software simply by immersing yourself in the feeling of coding, trusting your intuition and riding the wave of inspiration. But lately, I‚Äôve realized that for me, at least, the vibe is‚Ä¶off.</description>

      <title> I Got an M, Not an F</title>
      <link>https://ofb.biz/safari/article/1272.html</link>
      <description>In my elementary school, we weren‚Äôt given grades of A B C D F as was the standard before and since. Instead, New Haven R-II school employed a different set of letters that meant the same thing. They were E S M I F. I have no idea how this came to pass, but I hope it was because some person seeking a doctorate in education realized that his dissertation was due tomorrow and he had nothing. Frankly, I could get behind that kind of education theory. Beats modern pedagogy, anyway.</description>

      <description>I hear a lot of people say they want their startup to be more ‚Äòexperiment driven‚Äô. I‚Äôve encouraged that behaviour a lot myself. Take bets, see how they progress, gather data and use the result to validate, or invalidate some sort of hypothesis.

If executed well, this approach can</description>
