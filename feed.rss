      <description>We&amp;#39;re a team. There&amp;#39;s a mountain that no one has ever climbed before, but you - in your bones - believe we can. More importantly, you can stand in front of us, point at the mountain, and tell us the compelling story of how we&amp;#39;re going to climb that impossible peak.

      <title>Infra as a Code Is Cloud Lock-In</title>
      <link>https://flicksfix.com/posts/infra-as-a-code-is-cloud-lock-in/</link>
      <description>I’m a big fan of using IaaC tooling in all of my DevOps jobs. It’s a great pleasure to be able to define your infrastructure in a code and exactly know what do you have in your cloud. It helps you avoid the situation where you have to ask people in the company to know where something lives. You can simply CTRL+F through the project (assuming you store it in a single repo) and you always know where something is.</description>

      <description>Intro For unfamiliar with Polish economy For the context of this post - I currently live by renting a flat in Warsaw, almost by the city border (Far end of Ursyn&amp;#243;w district). See the attached view for having a context
 Here is how it looks like   I’ve pretty close connection to metro line (which to say is impressive here as Warsaw has only two metro lines).

      <title>SAML is insecure by design</title>
      <link>https://joonas.fi/2021/08/saml-is-insecure-by-design/</link>
      <description>What is SAML?  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.
 Source: Wikipedia
SAML is often used for single-sign on (“Sign in with Google”, “Sign in with Twitter” etc.). It means when you want to log in to example.com, example.com can trust &amp;amp; use an external authentication provider to assert the user’s identity for you. SAML is about communicating these authentication &amp;amp; identity details across organization boundaries (web domains).</description>

      <title>Coding Shorts: Changes to Coming to Startup in .NET 6

      <description>.NET 6 Preview 6 is here. One of the big changes I&amp;#39;m looking forward to is how startup is changing. With this change, comes &amp;quot;Minimal APIs&amp;quot; too. While getting rid of the Startup class is a welcome change, I&amp;#39;m a little less excited about how Minimal APIs might be over-used.

      <title>Coding Shorts: Dependency Injection Explained
</title>
      <link>https://wildermuth.com/2021/07/05/Coding-Shorts-Dependency-Injection-Explained/</link>
      <description>Like most of you, I&amp;#39;ve been using Dependency Injection in my projects for quite a while. Whether it be the built-in .NET Core Dependency Injection layer, Ninject, StructureMap, Unity, MEF, etc. I&amp;#39;ve been using a DI layer to do this work for many years. But before I understood the benefit, I did so somewhat reluctantly.

      <link>https://mariusschulz.com/blog/optional-chaining-the-operator-in-typescript</link>
      <description>TypeScript 3.7 added support for the ?. operator, also known as the optional chaining operator. We can use this operator to descend into an object whose properties potentially hold the values null or undefined without writing any null checks for intermediate properties.</description>

      <description>When researching construction, you invariably discover that any new or innovative idea has actually been tried over and over again, often stretching back decades. One of these new-but-actually-old ideas is the idea of a mechanical bricklayer, a machine to automate the construction of masonry walls.</description>

There exist different variants of this inner product argument. In some versions, none of the values ($\vec{a}$,  ...</description>

      <title>An Attempt at Demystifying Graph Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/machine-learning/graph-nets/</link>
      <description>There are a ton of great explainers of what graph neural networks are.
However, I find that a lot of them go pretty deep into the math pretty quickly.
Yet, we still are faced with that age-old problem: where are all the pics??
As such, just as I had attempted with Bayesian deep learning,
I&amp;#39;d like to try to demystify graph deep learning as well,
using every tool I have at my disposal
to minimize the number of equations and maximize intuition using pictures.
Here&amp;#39;s my attempt, I hope you find it useful!</description>
