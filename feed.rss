      <title>AutoMapper 13.0 Released</title>
      <link>https://www.jimmybogard.com/automapper-13-0-released/</link>
      <description>Today I pushed out AutoMapper 13.0 (is that too many...?):

 * Release Notes
 * Changelog
 * NuGet
 * Upgrade Guide

Probably the biggest change with this release is folding in Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection support directly. The AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection package is deprecated as a result.

Side note, the docs were messed up</description>
