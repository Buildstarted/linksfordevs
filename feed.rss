      <link>https://discourse.haskell.org/t/glasgow-haskell-compiler-9-0-1-rc1-now-available/1706</link>
      <description>The GHC team is very pleased to announce the availability of the first  release candidate of GHC 9.0.1 series. Source and binary distributions are  available at the usual place.  This release candidate comes quite a bit later than expected after  difficulty finding a performance neutral fix for a critical soundness  bug, #17760. See the migration page for details on the solution, particularly  if you are a library maintainer currently using the touch# primop or  Foreign.ForeignPtr.withForeignPtr....</description>

      <title>Resetting Zcash: its about privacy, not scale, econ, dev funds, or governance</title>
      <link>https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/resetting-zcash-its-about-privacy-not-scale-econ-dev-funds-or-governance/38003/84</link>
      <description>There are safeguards in place, but if you want 100% supply auditability on demand then you will be dissatisfied with any privacy coin.  Even the Monero guys are honest and say that they cannot guarantee supply, that’s the nature of “privacy”.  You have to rely on established cryptographic assumptions.  With Bitcoin you rely on some cryptographic assumptions, like the way private keys and addresses are generated: you assume that the bar is too high for a computer to brute force a public/privat...</description>

      <title>The Urgent vs. the Important</title>

      <description>I have recently bought an e-book by a Gumroad author named Luca Dellana. I have to admit I did it mainly to see how successful authors on Gumroad package their offerings. I was initially skeptical about the book, dismissing it as just another attempt to capitalize on the self-help trend.</description>

      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/the-cost-and-value-of-knowledge/</link>
      <description>I was a student in France when I discovered the Internet and the World Wide Web. At that time, I didn’t realize the value of the thing, even though I taught myself HTML from what was available at the time (even if I don’t remember the sites - they probably have disappeared into Limbo). When I began my professional life,&amp;#160; a project director of mine joked about the difference between the developer and the expert: &amp;#39;The expert knows about the cabinet where the documentation is&amp;#39;.

      <title>Adding comments to your static blog with Mastodon</title>
      <link>https://carlschwan.eu/2020/12/29/adding-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-mastodon/</link>
      <description>One of the biggest disadvantages of static site generators is that they are static and can&amp;amp;rsquo;t include comments.
There are multiples solutions to solve this problem. You could add a third party blog engine like Disqus, but this has the drawback of including a third-party tool with a bad privacy record in your website. Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden.</description>
