      <description>Socrates once said “the unexamined life is not worth living.” He was immediately sentenced to death afterwards.


I, too, often find myself examining the minutiae of programming languages. Thankfully, I have not been put to death for it (yet).

      <title>ECMAScript proposal: duplicate named capturing groups for regular expressions</title>
      <link>https://2ality.com/2024/05/proposal-duplicate-named-capturing-groups.html</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we take a look at the ECMAScript 2025 feature “Duplicate named capturing groups” which was proposed by Kevin Gibbons. It’s a feature for regular expressions that enables us to use the same capture group name more than once. The only restriction is that duplicates must exist in different alternatives – in other words: At any time, there can’t be more than one capture with a given name. Why is that useful? It lets us reuse regular expression fragments and match-processing code between alternatives.</description>

      <description>Today is the last day when the number of people alive will start with a seven. Sometime late Tuesday afternoon, or perhaps early Wednesday morning, the population will cross the eight billion mark. When I was a kid, the number they taught us in school was five billion. By the time I was in college, it was up to six, and a decade ago it hit seven.
Now it’s eight.</description>

      <title>How to Simulate MEV Arbitrage with REVM, Anvil and Alloy </title>
      <link>https://pawelurbanek.com/revm-alloy-anvil-arbitrage</link>
      <description>EVM simulation engine is a core component of any competitive MEV strategy. In this tutorial, I&amp;#39;ll describe how to use Anvil and its lower-level counterpart REVM to detect UniswapV3 MEV arbitrage opportunities. We will implement a working proof of concept using alloy-rs (a successor to ethers-rs). I&amp;#39;ll also discuss techniques for improving the performance and scalability of REVM-based simulations.</description>

      <description>Neovim 0.10 was the longest release cycle since the heady days of the 0.5 release. There are a ton of new features in this release (as well as some breaking changes), so be sure to check the full release notes. You can view the release notes directly in Nvim with :h news. The news file includes information on new features, deprecations, and breaking changes. I especially urge plugin authors to read this file carefully.</description>

      <title>Legalizations in LLVM Backend</title>
      <link>https://myhsu.xyz/llvm-codegen-legalization/</link>
      <description>Ideally, compilers can build a program for a wide variety of hardware without the need to change a single line of its source code. While there are exceptions and corner cases, this holds in the majority of cases. Which means that if the input code uses something that is not directly available on the hardware, the compiler has to figure out a way to effectively emulate those features.
This might sound a little distant to our typical software development experiences, but I’m not even talking about a problem that only happens on some exotic proprietary ML accelerator whatnots.</description>
