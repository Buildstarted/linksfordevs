      <description>Today, the United States informed Director-General Audrey Azoulay of the United States‚Äô decision to withdraw from UNESCO.

      <title>Jujutsu For Busy Devs | maddie, wtf?!</title>
      <link>https://maddie.wtf/posts/2025-07-21-jujutsu-for-busy-devs</link>
      <description>Jujutsu (jj) is a version control system with a
significantly simplified mental model and command-line interface compared to Git, without
sacrificing expressibility or power (in fact, you could argue Jujutsu is more powerful).
Stacked-diff workflows, seamless rebases, and ephemeral revisions are all natural with jj, and it
uses Git as a backend, which means you can begin using it non-destructively with a single command
and can always drop back down to Git if you need to.</description>
