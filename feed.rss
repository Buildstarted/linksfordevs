      <link>https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/08/21/weaponizing-image-scaling-against-production-ai-systems/</link>
      <description>In this blog post, we’ll detail how attackers can exploit image scaling on Gemini CLI, Vertex AI Studio, Gemini’s web and API interfaces, Google Assistant, Genspark, and other production AI systems. We’ll also explain how to mitigate and defend against these attacks, and we’ll introduce Anamorpher, our open-source tool that lets you explore and generate these crafted images.</description>

      <title>On Teaching: A Few Useful Analogies | JONATHAN DINU</title>
      <link>https://jonathandinu.com/writing/on-teaching/</link>
      <description>Over the years I have been teaching (and learning), I have often used a few analogies to help me organize my thoughts when approaching a new subject or curriculum. I have been very fortunate while building &lt;a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20141009023202/http://www.zipfianacademy.com/' target='_blank'&gt;Zipfian Academy&lt;/a&gt; to work with great students and teachers alike from whom I have learned immensely, and many of the formalisms contained here are borne out of that time.</description>

      <title>K-Nearest Neighbors – Running on Numbers</title>
      <link>https://runningonnumbers.com/posts/k-nearest-neighbors/</link>
      <description>Pitch tunneling is the art of deception. It’s a pitcher’s ability to make multiple, distinct pitches look identical as they leave the hand. From the batter’s perspective, two pitches can travel through the same “tunnel” partway to the plate before diverging. What looked like a hittable fastball suddenly drops off the table - a devastating curveball for a swinging strike. Effective tunneling neutralizes a batter’s ability to recognize a pitch, forcing a split-second, and often wrong, decision.</description>

      <link>https://epan.land/essays/2025-8_FancyRugDilemma</link>
      <description>This essay explores what I'll call the "Fancy Rug Effect" - how as means improve, abstract concepts gain value over practical ones. It also examines the corresponding dilemma: developing skills in the abstract increases the temptation to avoid practical problems. While not entirely new [1], hopefully this interpretation makes it more personal and possibly less ...fancy.</description>
