      <title>O(n) vs. O(n^2) Startups</title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/startup_types/</link>
      <description>I recently saw a tweet[1] about how people should go about starting startups/businesses, and it caused me to formalize my intuitions around two distinct types of tech businesses I am familiar with. I‚Äôll call them $O(n)$ startups and $O(n^{2})$ startups.
Throughout this essay, let n represent the time elapsed since launch. An $O(n)$ startup grows its key metric (revenue, users, etc.) roughly linearly with time‚Äîdouble the time, double the metric. An $O(n^{2})$ startup accelerates, with growth compounding super-linearly over time.</description>

      <title>Prompt Injection is a Weakness, not a Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://blog.zhade.dev/posts/2025-05-15-prompt-injection-weakness/</link>
      <description>Prompt Injection is the most widely discussed emergent threat in AI Systems. But how should organizations approach tracking and prioritizing it?
In my opinion, instead of being a vulnerability in and of itself, prompt injection is a weakness that leads to other, more potent vulnerabilities. While it is true that prompt injection is undesirable, it is (at the current time) unsolvable, and as such tracking it as its own vulnerability leads to more overhead and less desirable security outcomes.</description>

      <title>My 2025 high-end Linux PC üêß</title>

      <description>Turns out my previous attempt at this build had a faulty CPU! With the CPU replaced, the machine now is stable and fast! üöÄ In this article, I‚Äôll go into a lot more detail about the component selection, but in a nutshell, I picked an Intel 285K CPU for low idle power, chose a 4TB SSD so I don‚Äôt have to worry about running out of storage quickly, and a capable nvidia graphics card to drive my Dell UP3218K 8K monitor.</description>

      <description>I honestly wasn't expecting changes for the way I've been writing tests for the last 100 years but... I was pleasantly surprised.

Looks like Microsoft Testing Platform is packing a PUNCH! Let's see what's introduced and what that means for your tests!

      <title>LLMs Get Lost In Multi-Turn Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06120</link>
      <description>Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn, fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks. Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.</description>

      <description>Dusk OS is a 32-bit Forth and big brother to Collapse OS. Its
primary purpose is to be maximally useful during the first
stage of civilizational collapse, that is, when we can't produce
modern computers anymore but that there's still many modern computers around.</description>
