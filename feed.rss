      <description>In a largely overlooked 1888 essay, Peter Kropotkin went against the sentiment of many anarchist theorists of the time and argued that it could very well be the case that most individuals are not fundamentally kind and compassionate; are not searching for broad equality and do not have the interests of others at heart, finally concluding:</description>

      <title>2024 Predictions by @ttunguz</title>
      <link>https://tomtunguz.com/2024-predictions/</link>
      <description>Every year I make a list of predictions &amp;amp; score last year’s predictions.
Here are my predictions for 2024.
The IPO market remains closed through the first 6 months of the year. But a few mega issuances, especially Stripe &amp;amp; Databricks in the summer or fall, re-open it for others. The Fed cuts rates, which helps. M&amp;amp;A accelerates throughout the year. The anticipation of a rate change drives fear of target acquisition valuations.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using Sublime Text on and off for longer than I can remember. I think Sublime has been around since the start of my &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; career over 10 years ago, but I could be mistaken1. It certainly feels that long. And in that time I have never gotten upset with Sublime. I&amp;#39;ve never rage quit or ran into an issue of Sublime not being able to do the thing I wanted it to do. As much of a cliche it may sound: it just works.</description>

      <link>https://justinpease.com/2023/12/28/pointless-velocity</link>
      <description>Languages are dynamic. They grow and change shape. Existing words are repurposed to describe new ideas. Sometimes it’s helpful. Often it’s harmless. But in some cases, like today’s example, it results in layers of absolute and utter nonsense that compound gloriously.</description>

      <title>Artifical Intelligence as a Time Dilator</title>
      <link>https://byrnemluke.com/ideas/AI-time-dilation</link>
      <description>Jan 2024Ever since I was a kid, I&amp;#39;ve been fascinated by the concept of time. I would have dreams that felt like they lasted for days, whereas in reality only a few hours had passed. I wondered why the brain could only work at one second per second; why couldn’t I process things in parallel? I dreamt of a device that could enable me to run concurrent threads; so for example if I was studying for a test, I could read about two topics at the same time, and have them logically split into each thread.
This idea was flawed for many reasons that 12 year old me didn’t understand, but it was a fun thought experiment nonetheless.
Over the holidays, I was trying to take some time off while still being productive. I found myself leaning heavily on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Github Copilot etc. for a few hours per day. One day it hit me that we’ve invented the ultimate time dilators; tools that enable humans to work on tasks much more efficiently than before. Unlike past technological leaps like the internet, which broadened our access to information, today&amp;#39;s AI tools actively augment our task execution, marking a distinct shift in how technology empowers us.
Imagine, a few years from now, giving some software an objective - be it understanding a complex scientific theory or analyzing market trends. You wait just 15 minutes, and it presents a detailed report on the topic. Better yet, it&amp;#39;s equipped to teach you about this subject using its own research. How would this change the way we learn, make decisions, or even approach problem-solving?
I appreciate that the idea of personal AI assistants like J.A.R.V.I.S. isn&amp;#39;tnovel, and many have discussed it. But the reality of living through this technological revolution, witnessing the creation of tools that will redefine efficiency and productivity, is incredibly exciting.
If you are interested in the concept of time, I find The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli to be a fascinating read.</description>

      <description>As Aleo approaches mainnet, it’s vital to assess the security and integrity of our codebase. We engaged three independent security research firms — Trail of Bits, NCC Group, and zkSecurity — to audit snarkOS and snarkVM, the backbone of the Aleo Network.</description>

      <title>The One Billion Row Challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/</link>
      <description>
Let’s kick off 2024 true coder style—​I’m excited to announce the One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC), running from Jan 1 until Jan 31.


Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is deceptively simple:
write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station.
There’s just one caveat: the file has 1,000,000,000 rows!

— qntmyrrh (@qntm) November 24, 2023 I remember growing up with that same old adage of how you could be the next scientist to invent a cure for cancer, or a solution to climate change, or whatever. What they don’t tell you is that we already have solutions for a lot of problems, we just don’t use them.</description>

      <title>Writing a TrueType font renderer</title>
      <link>https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/</link>
      <description>Text is the medium of digital interaction, and text rendering has an outsized impact on the overall fit and finish of any system. It therefore pains me that axle has for years relied on a low-resolution 8x8 bitmap font. Let’s fix it!
Take a look at the characters composing this sentence. Note the curves, the negative space, the use of size and distance.
If you’ve got a magnifying glass handy, you can even see how ‘black-on-white’ text uses many shades of gray to make the text smoother on the eyes.</description>
