      <description>Years of repetitive stress injuries have led me to investigate alternative workstations.

      <title>Speed up a program for the 50 years old processor by 180000% – Blog about my engineering projects</title>
      <link>https://mark.engineer/2023/11/speed-up-a-program-for-50-years-old-processor-by-180000/</link>
      <description>In the previous year, I wrote the program, running on Intel’s first microprocessor – 4004, that computes the first 255 digits of π. But, unfortunately, I was not able to beat ENIAC’s achievement with 2035 computed digits 1. So let’s continue our journey. I picked the successor of 4004 – Intel’s 4040. This CPU is very similar to the 4004 and extends the instruction set a bit. To make my challenge a bit more spicy, I decided to follow these rules:</description>

      <title>Giving up my smartphone - Duoqin F22 Pro</title>
      <link>https://zknill.io/posts/duoqin-f22-pro/</link>
      <description>Background I was first attracted to the dumbphones after seeing a series of articles on Hacker News. I like the idea of using - and relying on - my phone less and less.
No plan survives contact with the enemy, and I knew that I wouldn’t manage in life with a stripped down phone that could only do calls, texts, and maybe some music.
Eventually I stumbled across the dumbphones subreddit (/r/dumbphones).</description>

When it comes to software engineers, I’m a sucker for simplicity and going back to basics. I have been coding for ~25+ years (~15 years professionally) and have truly gone through The Evolution of a Software Engineer. Throughout my career I have grown increasingly worried about the growing cargo culted complexity in our industry.</description>

      <description>Nuclear weapons are complex in many ways. The basic problem of achieving
criticality is difficult on its own, but deploying nuclear weapons as
operational military assets involves yet more challenges. Nuclear weapons must
be safe and reliable, even with the rough handling and potential of tampering
and theft that are intrinsic to their military use.</description>

      <title>[Proposal] - Cooperative BFT proving using striped, redundant binary trees</title>
      <link>https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-bft-proving-using-striped-redundant-binary-trees/2515</link>
      <description>Summary I propose a cooperative proving network with minimal alterations to Fernet.   Provers are randomly from the stake table using a VRF.  The proving network is a series of redundant binary trees that build the root proof in parallel.  Provers inside the binary tree send their proof chunks across trees to compensate for Byzantine provers. The proving network can be parameterized for f faulty provers out of n total provers.  If the sequencer does not distribute the data to provers in a timely...</description>

      <title>HTML DOM — Phuoc Nguyen</title>
      <link>https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/</link>
      <description>Web development moves at lightning speed. I still remember when I first started using libraries like jQuery, Prototype, script.aculo.us,
Zepto, and many more. Even with modern tools like Angular, VueJS, React, Solid and Svelte,
we still have to deal with the Document Object Model (DOM). While these frameworks encapsulate and hide direct DOM management, they still give us access to work with the DOM via refs and event handlers.</description>

      <title>Interruptions cost 23 minutes 15 seconds, right?</title>
      <link>https://blog.oberien.de/2023/11/05/23-minutes-15-seconds.html</link>
      <description>You’ve likely read lots of blog posts stating that it takes 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back to work after an interruption, context switch, or meeting. Thus, “do you have five minutes” ends up not only costing those few minutes, but instead about half an hour. But where does that number come from?</description>
