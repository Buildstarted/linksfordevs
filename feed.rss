      <link>https://woodruff.dev/from-chaos-to-code-migrating-legacy-infrastructure-to-terraform/</link>
      <description>Raise your hand if you’ve ever inherited a mess of manually created cloud resources. Maybe your team has been clicking around in cloud consoles for years, and now your infrastructure is an unmanageable, undocumented monster. Or perhaps you have hundreds of resources, and nobody knows exactly how they were configured. Sound familiar? Don’t worry—Terraform can bring order to the madness!</description>

      <title>Self-Hosting a Firefox Sync Server</title>
      <link>https://blog.diego.dev/posts/firefox-sync-server/</link>
      <description>After switching from Firefox to LibreWolf, I became interested in the idea of self-hosting my own Firefox Sync server.
