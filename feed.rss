      <title>Auditing a Graded Video Game – Zdziarski&amp;#39;s Blog of Things</title>
      <link>https://www.zdziarski.com/blog/?p=10051</link>
      <description>Anyone who’s read my blog knows that I am not a fan of video game grading. Grading companies, in my experience, do marginal quality work, and at a superficial level that cannot be audited once an item has been sealed. The holy plastic WATA box is all too often used to convince sellers that their item somehow has more value than it actually does, and buyers the frustration of passing over finds because of greedy sellers who drank the kool-aid.&amp;#160;Overall, video game grading has done more harm to the hobby than good.</description>
