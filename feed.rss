      <title>Database Protocols Are Underwhelming</title>
      <link>https://byroot.github.io/performance/2025/03/21/database-protocols.html</link>
      <description>If you’ve been in this trade for a while, you have probably seen dozens of debates on the merits and problems of SQL as a relational database query language. As an ORM maintainer, I have a few gripes with SQL, but overall it is workable, and anyway, it has so much inertia that there’s no point fantasizing about a replacement.</description>

      <title>Early Thoughts on OpenAI’s ‘Agents’</title>
      <link>https://kateyeh.blot.im/openai-agents</link>
      <description>“Isn’t an agent just an LLM workflow?”. This has been true of a lot of companies building “agents” recently. I like Anthropic’s definition, which is a program that can use tools and make its own decisions.</description>

      <title>The Software Engineering Identity Crisis - Annie Vella</title>
      <link>https://annievella.com/posts/the-software-engineering-identity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Many of us became software engineers because we found our identity in building things. Not managing things. Not overseeing things. Building things. With our own hands, our own minds, our own code.
But that identity is being challenged.
AI coding assistants aren’t just changing how we write software - they’re fundamentally transforming who we are. We’re shifting from creators to orchestrators, from builders to overseers. From engineers to something that looks suspiciously like… managers.</description>

      <title>REST Constraint #3: Going Stateless for Scalability - Chris Woody Woodruff</title>
      <link>https://woodruff.dev/rest-constraint-3-going-stateless-for-scalability/</link>
      <description>When it comes to building scalable web applications, statelessness is one of REST’s most powerful constraints. It simplifies architecture, makes scaling easier, and helps APIs handle massive traffic loads without breaking a sweat. But what does being “stateless” actually mean in REST, and why is it such a big deal?</description>

      <title>Vibe Coding is a Dangerous Fantasy</title>
      <link>https://nmn.gl/blog/vibe-coding-fantasy</link>
      <description>Last week, X exploded when a “vibe coder” announced his SaaS was under attack. His business, built entirely with AI assistance and “zero hand-written code,” was experiencing bypassed subscriptions, maxed-out API keys, and database corruption. His follow-up admission made this notable: “as you know, I’m not technical so this is taking me longer than usual to figure out.” As someone deeply immersed in the AI code generation space, I’ve been watching this unfold with a mix of sympathy and frustration. Let me be clear — I’m not against AI-assisted development. My own tool aims to improve code generation quality. But there’s a growing and dangerous fantasy that technical knowledge is optional in the new AI-powered world. After observing many similar (though less public) security disasters, I’ve come to a controversial conclusion: vibe coding isn’t just inefficient — it’s potentially catastrophic.</description>

In this practical walkthrough, I explore how AI can transform the often tedious process of writing unit tests for .NET applications. Starting with a tour of my semi-complex .NET project, I explain its real-world use cases and demonstrate some existing test implementations. The video reveals why providing AI (specifically using Cursor) with example tests dramatically improves its ability to generate high-quality unit tests that match your coding standards and patterns. Watch as I demonstrate the complete workflow - from generating unit tests for the Domain layer to troubleshooting and fixing AI-generated code errors, and finally running the successful tests in Visual Studio.

We'll then extend the approach to the Application layer, showing how this technique can be applied across different parts of your architecture. Whether you're looking to reduce testing bottlenecks or improve your coverage, this step-by-step guide shows exactly how AI can become a valuable addition to your .NET development toolkit.

      <title>Deploying With Confidence: Sam Gomez on Terraform, Bicep, and Infrastructure as Code</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=1tTagViBT8M</link>
      <description>Show Notes "If you talk to people that have been doing Terraform for many years, they're going to tell you that, "Terraform is the law and Terraform is the way to go." But like you said, there's different tools, I would say, or languages that you can use for infrastructure as code. And it really depends what you want to do, what your developers are used to or are comfortable with and what works with your organization as it should be with any tool in software development. You got to grab the one or use the one that is more appropriate for your use case, your scenario, your organization"— Sam Gomez

 Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie "GaProgMan" Taylor.

 In this episode, Sam Gomez joined us to talk about Infrastructure as Code, why you might want to think about using something like Terraform and Bicep, and how they can help you to automate your deployments to the public cloud.

 Sam also talks about best practises for CI/CD and ways to test your Infrastructure as Code ahead of running it--something that we've all felt the pain of in the past, I'm sure.

 "Terraform has what's called validation for your parameters. So like I said, you can set up a validation that says, "the only values for the SKU for a SQL server are basic," for example. And if somebody tries to give a different value to that particular parameter, it'll stop automatically and say, "okay, this validation has failed. You know, the value allowed is this one." You can do the same thing with Bicep. So that's another added layer of protection against making these kind of mistakes and adding or configuring the wrong values in your deployments"— Sam Gomez

 Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.

 Podcasthon 2025! One last thing before we start the episode: we're super happy to participate in the 3rd edition of Podcasthon For one week, more than a thousand podcasts will highlight a charity of their choice. And today, I have the pleasure of welcoming Andy's Man Club to the show. Throughout this episode, I'll interrupt the conversation a few times to talk about the importance of mental fitness.

 The reason that I've picked Andy's Man Club is because mental health support is very important to me. I've used their groups for almost two years and have had the honour of being asked to step up and help run one of those groups. If you'll forgive the name for now, Andy's Man Club is a UK-based charity which organises weekly, informal, peer-to-peer talking groups for anyone over the age of 18 who identifies as male. I'll talk more about Andy's Man Club later in the episode.
