      <title>The Secret To Planning An Impactful Conference Talk!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=QRdgew4QXtQ</link>
      <description>Ever sat through a conference talk wondering "Why should I care?" or "What's in it for me?" You're not alone. In this video, I'll reveal the secret that most speakers miss when planning their talks, and how you can avoid this common pitfall.

Hi, I'm James, a storytelling technologist who's delivered talks worldwide. I'm about to share the #1 most crucial principle that will transform your presentations from self-centered to audience-captivating.

What You'll Learn:
- The fundamental truth about who the REAL hero of your talk should be (hint: it's not you)
- Why even the most brilliant technical content fails without this key element
- How to instantly connect with your audience by addressing their specific pain points
- The difference between generic industry talk and compelling personal storytelling
- My proven template for planning audience-centered presentations

I'll demonstrate this principle through contrasting examples of conference openings and share a behind-the-scenes look at my own talk planning process.

      <description>When you do need thousands and tens of thousands of transactions per second, TigerBeetle is there for you. A few hundred per second you can do it yourself in ~25 lines of code.

      <title>Mistakes and cool things to do with arena allocators</title>
      <link>https://zylinski.se/posts/dynamic-arrays-and-arenas/</link>
      <description>When programming in Odin you can use arena allocators. If you use an arena allocator combined with a dynamic array, then there are a couple of pitfalls that may not be apparent at first. Let‚Äôs look at what arenas are, how you can run into trouble when naively using them with dynamic arrays and what you can do instead.
What‚Äôs an arena? How does it work? Arenas and arena allocators are useful for grouping allocations that have the same lifetime.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs late afternoon and you‚Äôre vibe coding. You‚Äôve been editing different parts of your codebase, building your vision step by step. You pause sometimes to review, but mostly you‚Äôre moving forward to make it work. As your project grows, keeping track of everything becomes tricky. Code that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly breaks today, and you‚Äôre not sure why. You keep switching between files and conversations, losing your flow. There‚Äôs no clear picture of what‚Äôs happening, making you wonder if you‚Äôre making real progress.</description>

      <title>Optimizing memory usage with modern .NET features</title>
      <link>https://mijailovic.net/2025/04/10/memory-optimizations/</link>
      <description>After my service migrated
from .NET Framework to .NET 8 (and later to .NET 9), it felt like a whole new world had opened to me. All
the modern .NET features that I had only been reading about on the .NET Blog
were finally available to me. Armed with Microsoft‚Äôs continuous, fleet-wide performance profiler, I embarked on a journey
to find the places where my service was allocating the most memory and fix the unnecessary allocations by using the newly
available .NET APIs. In this blog post, I‚Äôll show you some common code patterns that can be found in .NET Framework code,
along with their modern, high-performance alternatives.</description>
