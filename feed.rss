      <title>Burnout In Software Engineers: How To Get OUT Of It</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=bLWTf2YfUPk</link>
      <description>Burnout is something we don&amp;#39;t talk about enough in software engineering.

One of the scariest parts about burnout:

It can sneak up on you. You don&amp;#39;t realize it until it&amp;#39;s too late.

Typically, when I talk about burnout, it&amp;#39;s mostly about identifying and preventing it. However, in this video, we&amp;#39;ll take a bit of a spin on the topic as we look at overcoming burnout once you&amp;#39;re already experiencing it.

      <title>Let’s Encrypt: Delivering SSL/TLS Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://letsencrypt.org/2014/11/18/announcing-lets-encrypt/</link>
      <description>Vital personal and business information flows over the Internet more frequently than ever, and we don&amp;amp;rsquo;t always know when it&amp;amp;rsquo;s happening. It&amp;amp;rsquo;s clear at this point that encrypting is something all of us should be doing. Then why don’t we use TLS (the successor to SSL) everywhere? Every browser in every device supports it. Every server in every data center supports it. Why don’t we just flip the switch?
The challenge is server certificates.</description>

      <description>I was just at a Tyler Cowen lecture in NYC — one of my heroes and biggest intellectual influences — and watching everyone file out after the talk, I kept thinking about this really great comment someone had made on the event announcement: “Do these 92Y talks typically offer space to build community and talk with other attendees, or are they pretty stale pay &amp;gt; attend &amp;gt; leave?”</description>

      <title>How to Build a Chess Engine and Fail</title>
      <link>https://obrhubr.org/chess-engine</link>
      <description>A Chess-AI is something every programmer should build at least once and [Sebastian Lague’s](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) [competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iScy18pVR58) was the perfect opportunity for me to do so. Constrained to 1024 tokens I wanted to implement an evaluation function similar to that of Stockfish’s NNUE but heavily simplified. And instead of using a complex feed-forward algorithm to train the neural network I wanted to optimise the parameters using a genetic algorithm that relied on historical Stockfish data. However, I quickly realised why the model Stockfish uses has 50MBs of data and would not fit into my small bot for the competition…</description>

      <description>Normally when developers/SWEs/SRE/IT are oncall for a project, the oncall is from Monday of one week to Monday of the following week. This is sub-optimal. Instead it should be Tuesday to Tuesday. This is a 0 cost improvement to everyone’s quality of life and improves schedule accuracy.</description>
