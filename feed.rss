      <title>Trying out the built-in container support for the .NET SDK</title>
      <link>https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/trying-out-the-built-in-container-support-for-the-dotnet-7-sdk/</link>
      <description>A few months ago the built-in container support for the .NET SDK was announced. In this post I&amp;#39;ll put this feature to test, I&amp;#39;ll try to migrate from an application that contains a rather complex Dockerfile to a new version that has no Dockerfile and instead uses the container support feature.</description>

While we have over a decade of network expansion and innovation under our belts, what may not be intuitive is that our goal is not to increase revenue from this change.</description>

      <title>Mutual Contact Discovery</title>
      <link>https://blog.xot.nl/2022/09/27/mutual-contact-discovery/index.html</link>
      <description>Messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp offer a contact
  discovery service that allow you to discover which of the
  contacts in your address book are also a member. Depending on the
  implementation, this creates certain privacy risks. Even though Signal uses a
  protocol involving a trusted execution environment to mitigate the
  risk, an inherent risk of (one-sided) contact discovery remains: if
  someone (a patient, an ex) has your phone number in their address
  book, they will be notified when you join Signal. Not necessarily what
  you expect when joining a messaging service that focuses on privacy.
  This motivated me to study mutual contact discovery, where
  users of a messaging app can only discover each other when
  both have each other’s phone number in their address
  book.</description>
