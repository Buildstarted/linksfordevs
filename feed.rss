      <title>Blackfacts and the Wakanda Technology Platform - Technology By Us, for Us, About Us [w/ASL]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7bWu5_I-QQ</link>
      <description>The subject of 'Inclusion' in the Tech Industry is a hot topic today.

In 1990, when my employer at the time declined to offer to reimburse me for programming classes I was thinking of taking, the only thing I asked them for was to amend my employment agreement to not claim ownership of anything I built, or in other words, not get in my way.

They agreed, and I taught myself to code by reading books and launched a programming career that has now spanned close to three decades.

When I was able to quit that job a couple of years later from revenue from a product I wrote in my basement apartment, I realized the wide open opportunities available in the world of technology, and committed myself to creating technologies to help 'Bring Communities of Color Into the Information Age.'

Today, I have built a technology platform that powers my 23-years-running website Blackfacts.com, designed to provide Black schools, organizations and businesses with content and technology services on a global basis.

This talk will describe and demonstrate some of the components of the platform, called the Wakanda Technology Platform, inspired by a sub-text of the fictional nation of Wakanda, who was able to protect its culture and people because they were in possession of superior technology.

      <title>MLOps- The .Net Way with Alexander Slotte</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukdh5i6tcZE</link>
      <description>𝐌𝐋𝐎𝐩𝐬- 𝐓𝐡𝐞 .𝐍𝐞𝐭 𝐖𝐚𝐲 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐒𝐥𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐞
Automation has long been a cornerstone of modern Software Engineering and has given rise to successful initiatives such as DevOps.

Automating the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training to deployment in production, is a lot more complex and requires careful consideration of multiple axis of change, such as data, code and configuration, but can yield fantastic results when done right.

MLOps, also known as Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML), has recently gotten a lot of interest and was mentioned by ThoughtWorks as a technique worth keeping a close eye on.  

MLflow, Azure Machine Learning and AWS SageMaker are tools most commonly associated with MLOps, but did you know you can do it in .NET as well?

Join Alexander in this session where we walk through some common concepts related to MLOps, and dive into the world of ML.NET and MLOps.NET to understand how we can achieve end-to-end machine learning life-cycle automation both on-premise and in the cloud.

      <title>February 26, 2020 - Open Source Project Management and Deploying to Azure !coffee</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wghZBHLzlb4</link>
      <description>In this stream, Fritz is working through some project management tasks for the BlazorWebFormsComponents project and attempts to deploy a new collection of samples to Microsoft Azure... and it doesn't go well.

11:39 - What embarrassing things would you do for your job?
18:27 - What do I need to install for this project Jeff? I couldn't get the packages restore for the BeforeWebForms project.
20:47 - How do you go about making UI tests for something like webforms in Blazor?
37:16 - Is there a way to get the code to convert the method name into a string?
40:42 - Does JavaScript get any syntax highlighting and linting in wasm/Blazor?
44:13 - Benefit of having a separate service for calling JavaScript is that it makes it much easier to mock the interactions with javascript in tests.
51:39 - Is there any way to make it fail not-silently if the method doesn't exist?
55:20 - If you have your JavaScript method calls as configuration, then the end user can "override" them if they have specific requirements?
1:00:13 - Does this mean there is something fundamentally missing in Blazor or VS? 
1:07:30 - How much JavaScript are you planning on in this project?

      <title>March 3, 2020 - Minimal March PIVOT!  Live Coding .NET on a Chromebook</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P-sgj0l7lI</link>
      <description>March is here, and Fritz starts a new themed month:  Minimal March.  All throughout the month of March he is coding with minimal hardware, minimal tools, just a text editor and a command-line to build .NET applications.  Today Fritz introduces the Chromebook Challenge and how he is using a Chromebook to write Blazor applications.

1:38:42 - Is ASP.NET Core self-hosted? 
1:42:09 - Once .NET hit version 5 will .NET Core continue?
1:44:42 - Do you know when any preview of .NET 5 is available?
1:47:33 - What is your preference between ASP.NET Core MVC and Razor Pages?
1:48:23 - Fonts where?
1:52:40 - What are your thoughts on using Visual Studio Online someday?
2:07:11 - Would it be easier to use Visual Studio Online via the Chromebook?
2:20:03 - What is .tt file?
2:22:30 - Is there a guide on how to do this?

      <description>Alex from Madrinas Coffee joins us and we learn about sentiment analysis and artificial intelligence by writing a service that analyzes Twitter for messages containing keywords and reporting the sentiment of those messages

46:41 - Where should I start if I want to learn AI?
1:14:50 - Could you enhance the model's scoring by adjusting individual scores?
1:25:01 - How difficult would it be to input more 'live' data into PowerBI? Either direct link from Twitter, or hourly updates?
1:34:50 - But seriously, how much PowerBI can be turned over to those more 'in the know', like marketing, sales, etc.?
1:59:11 - How do get the Live with the red dot on Twitter? Is that manual or StreamLabs or something else?

      <title>Moving work Out-of-Process using Brighter and RabbitMQ</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG4WLiZEAuc</link>
      <description>Once you start doing in-process request &amp; event dispatching, you'll soon want to move out of process so you can isolate work from the caller/invoker. This is often times the next logical step if you're using MediatR for commands and especially for events/notifications.  Here's how you can do use the same paradigm for in-process and out-of-process using Brighter and RabbitMQ.

      <title>My personal Quality Assurance list before submitting my applications to QA</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/my-personal-quality-assurance-list-before-submitting-my-applications-to-qa/</link>
      <description>As developers, our responsibility is to create applications based on a list of specifications defined by the systems analyst in collaboration with the customer. Usually, we divide the application into deliverables that allow us to complete independent and useful functionalities for the user without having the application completely ready.
It’s very important to make our applications as clean and tested as possible before reaching QA, trying to make sure it has the least possible inconvenience, so I recommend that before reaching the QA stage to have your “Functional Completeness checklist”, so you can make sure that your application is ready! That’s why in this post I will be writing about my personal advices to complete the development cycle satisfactorily, to the extent possible.




Functional Completeness Checklist  What exactly does that mean for me? 
It's a personal list that I have established to determine the set of tasks that must be verified to say that a requirement is really ready in our App. This allows me to have my own quality control before going to QA, trying to minimize the risk to get the App returned because something did not go well.
So, for my “Functional Completeness Checklist”, I will be dividing the requirements in sections as following:
➖ UI/UX requirements
➖ Basic functionalities
➖ The Resources
➖ Validation requirements
➖ Usability




Let's start!
The first thing that we must have on hand to make sure that our application passes our personal quality controls is the requirements definition document, where all the requirements and deliverables are defined with their corresponding due date (In which it's assumed we will do this process). With this document, we can derive a list of requirements that should be completed on each date and these are the ones that we will make sure are ready!


.
Here we'll pay attention to the design. Our UIs are supposed to be crafted based on designs given by designers or some other source (It doesn’t matter). The important thing here is to make sure that these designs match the following:
.

✅ The design was correctly replicated for all the available platforms of our App?
✅ The design has preserved both landscape and portrait for all the available platforms of our App (This part can be ignored if it is indicated in the requirements since we can have applications with a specific orientation)
✅ Was the behavior of the design controls tested on each of the available platforms? (Buttons, Entry...)
✅ The user notices:  It’s important that we always keep the user informed of what is happening. (For example, notify them if the internet is leaving, when a process was successful (such as user registration) or when it failed (when the user could not register).)
These are things that we should keep in mind from the beginning, but if for some reason we did not have them, make sure they are fully applied now, this gives a good bonus to our UX.





✅ Functionalities: Do all the functionalities respond correctly as indicated in the definition of requirements? (For example: Make sure that the “Register users” button actually sends the registration request to the server)
✅ Navigation: Regarding the navigation between screens, do they all follow the corresponding logical flow?





✅ As we know, each platform has its own resource structure, and sometimes when we are developing we just add the image of the base dimension so that it can be seen on any device without having to generate the others. It is important not to forget to add all the dimensions corresponding to each platform.
✅ Make sure that all the icons are generated for the devices your App will be working on. (Here an article about how to do it!)








.
Every field that we have in our App, have to be validated (Of course depending of the goal). For example, if we have an email field we know that must validate if the data inserted ave an email structure or if we have a phone number field can not accept letters.
.
Create a list of all your app validation required and verify that all comply with the corresponding validations.
.

🙋‍♀️ For example: I have a user registration screen that has the following fields:
.


🟠  Full name              ➖ Only supports letters.

🟠  Phone Number    ➖ Only supports numbers and preferably has a mask.

🟠 Age                          ➖ Only supports numbers.

🟠  Email                     ➖  You must validate that the information you enter is a valid email.
.

You can do these validations fields with the Behaviors in Xamarin Forms. Here I leave an article about how to do it!.





We know that there are UI / UX experts but as developers, we can help with good practices too! Applying certain features for users to make a super big and favorable change for them!  💕
.

✅ There is a field that just accepts numbers/letters? Great! Set your app for that the device keyboard just shows numbers/letters respectively.
.

✅ There is a  password field? Active “IsPassword” property on your entry field so it appears masked with **** symbols.
.






That’s it! I hope these little tips work super well for you when developing your Apps! and build your own “Functional Completeness Checklist”!  😎

Thanks for reading! 💚💕
