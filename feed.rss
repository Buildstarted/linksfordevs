      <title>Stephen Bussey - What is a GenServer?</title>
      <link>https://stephenbussey.com/2021/07/02/what-is-a-genserver.html</link>
      <description>GenServer is one of the most common tools in the Elixir toolbag. I’ve written in the past about why you don’t need to know about GenServers to get started with Elixir. However, you will inevitably hit the point where you want (or need) them. This post will be my description of a GenServer to beginners to the language.</description>

      <title>One-piece Cody</title>
      <link>https://jfeldbrugge.github.io/One-piece-Cody/</link>
      <description>The one-piece Cody was designed by Ton Vinken, as a way to construct a Cody kite out of a single piece of material. The one-piece Cody kite is in many senses similar to the traditional Cody. However, it differs in the upper planes of the front and back and the lower planes of the central boxes.</description>

      <description>I do not agree with GitHub&amp;#39;s unauthorized and unlicensed use of copyrighted

	ML-powered GitHub
	Copilot product. This product injects source code derived
	from copyrighted sources into the software of their customers
	without informing them of the license of the original source code.

      <title>Blazor Flash Cards - State Management with Fluxor</title>

      <description>I&amp;#39;m a massive fan of the Redux pattern. One thing, though, it adds extra boilerplate code and may look overwhelming at first. But you get used to it and start to appreciate the power of it once your application grows to be a giant where state management becomes a nightmare.</description>
