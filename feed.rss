      <title>Thought Space vs Reality</title>
      <link>https://suketk.com/thought-space-vs-reality</link>
      <description>There are two worlds - the one in our head and the one that is real. It’s easy to conflate the two; perception is reality, the saying goes. But they are separate. Perception is just a representation of reality and as we know, the map is not the territory.</description>

      <title>Managing (side)projects - Bram&amp;#39;s Blog</title>
      <link>https://bram.dingelstad.works/blog/managing-side-projects/</link>
      <description>I’ve always had a soft spot for working on something that I thought was a good idea. I have loved the idea of being a little inventor since I was a kid. Being a programmer that gets to work on all kinds of systems or wants to build a lot of them, I found myself clutching this fantasy every single time when starting another project. But how do I make sense of them? Have I started too many? Why aren’t any of them finished? And why do I feel so demotivated to work on any of them, even though I really want to work on one?</description>

      <title>Tap your phone at Gold Coast bus stops to access my website</title>
      <link>https://joshwithers.blog/2021/02/22/tap-your-phone.html</link>
      <description>My February 2021 Apple Fitness challenge is to walk 227km in the month. So I was out late last night closing in on the target when I stopped and looked at the bus timetable sign at a local bus stop.
That NFC tag piqued my curiosity. I wondered if it worked on iPhone?
So I tapped my iPhone 12 Pro up against the NFC logo and a website hyperlink notification popped up like when you scan a QR code.</description>

      <title>The modern packager’s security nightmare – Michał G&amp;#243;rny</title>
      <link>https://blogs.gentoo.org/mgorny/2021/02/19/the-modern-packagers-security-nightmare/</link>
      <description>One of the most important tasks of the distribution packager is to ensure that the software shipped to our users is free of security vulnerabilities.  While finding and fixing the vulnerable code is usually considered upstream’s responsibility, the packager needs to ensure that all these fixes reach the end users ASAP.  With the aid of central package management and dynamic linking, the Linux distributions have pretty much perfected the deployment of security fixes.  Ideally, fixing a vulnerable dependency is as simple as patching a single shared library via the distribution’s automated update system.</description>
