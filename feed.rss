      <title>Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16892</link>
      <description>A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in
Cu-substituted apatite (`LK99&amp;#39;) has invigorated interest in the understanding
of what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature
superconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on
Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat
bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in
already established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of
these isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu
ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results
suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy
physics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on
possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite</description>

      <title>Semiconducting transport in Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16802</link>
      <description>The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature
superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational
attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite
(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have
successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of
these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a
highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9
Ohm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of
~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits
semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity
of ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray
diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,
when a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial
Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic
levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a
room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful
re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties.</description>

      <title>So, you want to deploy on the edge?</title>
      <link>https://zknill.io/posts/edge-database/</link>
      <description>Application developers often deploy their apps into a single area, generally represented by a handful of AZs in a single region. No matter where their users make requests from, those requests get served by the region where the developers’ apps run.
If a user makes a request from Europe, and the apps run in US East, that adds an extra 100-150ms of latency just by round-tripping across the Atlantic.
Edge computing tries to solve this problem, by letting app developers deploy their applications across the globe, so that apps serve the user requests closer to the user.</description>

      <description>I happened upon a post by Gwern discussing, in
some detail, various solutions to riddle #14 from Nigel Coldwell’s
list of quant riddles. I initially got
as far as the problem description in Gwern’s article and avoided reading
further so I could first solve it for myself. The problem is stated as follows:</description>

      <title>F# Extends its String Interpolation Syntax to Reduce Escaping </title>

      <description>F# has introduced a new syntax feature in preview to make it easier to work with interpolated strings. The main advantage of the new syntax is it allows to customize how many curly braces delimit an interpolated expression, thus reducing the need for escaping special characters.</description>

      <title>Modular Monoliths with Layla Porter</title>
      <link>https://open.spotify.com/episode/52uCuoROysgv3EhHlpRqph</link>
      <description>Listen to this episode from .NET Rocks! on Spotify. Microservices or Monoliths? Carl and Richard talk to Layla Porter about choosing a middle ground between microservices and monoliths, with modular monoliths. Layla talks about the pushback from the community around microservices and the insistence that there is &amp;quot;one right way.&amp;quot; Monoliths have their advantages until they are a problem - but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that re-architecting everything is the right way to go. Chipping off parts of the monolith into satellite modules strikes a balance of flexibility and scalability - and opens the door to accessing the power of bus architectures when needed!</description>
