      <description>OpenAI released two major new preview models today: o1-preview and o1-mini (that mini one is also a preview, despite the name)—previously rumored as having the codename “strawberry”. There’s a lot …</description>

      <title>Arrays of Wisdom of the Ancients</title>
      <link>https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/</link>
      <description>In way too many cases, it is instructive and educational to follow up on the findings you just got from a targeted workload, in order to see how general the conclusions are, and whether you understand them well. Beware, this is the Rabbit Hole of Performance Engineering — you cannot finish the dive, you can only stop it.</description>

      <title>Advanced friction logs: Empathy Sessions</title>
      <link>https://thagomizer.com/blog/2024/09/11/advanced-friction-logs-empathy.html</link>
      <description>In 2018, I wrote a blog post about Friction Logging. Friction logs are one of my favorite DevRel tools, and I share that post with mentees regularly. If you haven’t read that blog, I recommend reviewing it since this post assumes familiarity with the friction log format.</description>

      <title>So you&amp;#39;ve been laid off: a guide for mid-level and above software devs and leadership • Dylan Fitzgerald</title>
      <link>https://dylanfitzgerald.net/blog/so-youve-been-laid-off/</link>
      <description>(A quick preamble: if you’re not in software as either someone who can write code or someone who professionally makes developers more effective, this is going to come off as utterly out of touch. I wish this applied to more people in more career paths, and it doesn’t, and it’s not fair. If you’re not based in the US or Canada, you might find it unrelatable for other reasons.)
There’s been so, so many layoffs visible on LinkedIn and elsewhere recently, and it’s clear that they’re causing a lot of pain, anxiety, and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Why is language documentation still so terrible?</title>
      <link>https://walnut356.github.io/posts/language-documentation/</link>
      <description>Seriously, is there a good reason for this? I feel like I&amp;#39;m going crazy because almost every language doc I&amp;#39;ve looked at is legitimately awful in a bunch of obvious ways. It&amp;#39;s not uncommon to see third party libraries updated by a single person that are better structured, more thorough, with better layouts than the official documentation upheld by the language team itself.</description>

      <title>Making Things People Want vs. Making Things That Alter Thinking</title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/building-stuff/</link>
      <description>I recently rewrote the interests section of my blog to be more concise. The primary interest I wrote down was “making things that alter thinking at scale.” When I distilled what I believed to be one of my long-term goals I landed on that.
Recently I thought about how this is both similar and different to YC’s goal of “Make something people want”.
I find that successful startups do both. People want it and it changes the way people think.</description>
