      <title>Navigating Evolving Code Standards Without Chaos - Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=7pThW-UTzr8</link>
      <description>Even with the best intentions, codebases that live on for an extended period of time eventually experience some drift. We might set ourselves up with the best patterns and practices, but in 1, 3, 5, or 10 years from now... things change.

How might we consider navigating codebases that evolve over time?

As with all livestreams, I'm looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>The world needs you to consume less news</title>
      <link>https://danbartlett.co.uk/the-world-needs-you-to-consume-less-news/</link>
      <description>It‚Äôs considered good and upstanding to stay on top of world affairs. You want to be educated about the world, right? But there is so much to keep up on. So much injustice to counter.
I‚Äôm here to tell you that the world needs you to consume less news. I know you‚Äôre doing it from a good place but I think you should take a break.
First, the expectation to ‚Äústay on top of things‚Äù is a modern invention. Something only possible during the most recent fraction of human history. For most of history, news travelled slowly‚Äîby word of mouth, by post, by pigeon. Now it shrieks at us from every screen, 24/7. This is not normal. It‚Äôs not neutral either.</description>

      <title>The Move Faster Manifesto</title>
      <link>http://brianguthrie.com/p/the-move-faster-manifesto/</link>
      <description>I‚Äôve worked in the software industry for over twenty years. I have been a consultant, a line engineer, a director, a founder, and a CTO. I have worked at firms as small as two engineers and as large as fifty thousand. I frequently get asked how to move faster in software. This is what I say. It is easier to describe than it is to do. Rules for moving faster I am not some kind of process relativist; process matters.</description>

      <link>https://venam.net/blog/unix/2025/04/18/mechanism_policy.html</link>
      <description>Throughout the countless years of research on this blog a common thread always comes up: Some features and toggles are often hidden under mountains of hubris that nobody understands. It could be because the software is under-or-badly documented, that it's 'too-flexible' and made to handle cases that never materialize, or just that...</description>

      <title>Linux is now the best gaming system. ÔΩú fernvenue's Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/linux-is-now-the-best-gaming-system/</link>
      <description>When it comes to gaming on Linux, many many many people‚Äôs understanding stil remains in the Jurassic era. For the past few years, I‚Äôve been using Linux as my main operating system for both work and gaming. From my personal experience, the gaming experience on Linux is far superior to that of macOS and Windows. I know I know‚Ä¶whenever I mention this, there are always some old-school individuals who come out to say that Linux‚Äôs driver configuration is complex, its game support is not rich enough, and its compatibility issues are significant, among other problems. In this article, I will directly address these issues and let everyone understand how much the gaming experience on Linux has developed by 2025.</description>

      <description>The Pareto Principle, also called the 80/20 rule, states that a few things (the vital few) are much more important than most things (the trivial many). I came across this principle many years ago, in Richard Koch‚Äôs wonderful book.</description>

      <description>GPU programming used to mean wrangling C++ compilers, bloated SDKs, and vendor-specific toolchains. That‚Äôs changing. You can now write GPU code in modern languages like Rust and Zig with fewer layers. This post walks through the current state of Zig‚Äôs GPU backends and how they stack up across Vulkan, OpenCL, and native ISAs.</description>
