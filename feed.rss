      <title>Teaching using manipulatives</title>
      <link>https://cestlaz.github.io/post/manipulatives/</link>
      <description>Listened to the latest episode of the CS Ed Podcast yesterday. It featured Colleen Lewis, of CS Teaching Tips fame talking about how she uses manipulatives. Much like Colleens session last SIGCSE on microteaching this episode made me both happy and sad.
Happy because it&amp;#39;s awesome that Colleen is bringing attention to strong classroom teaching practices and she&amp;#39;s sharing good stuff. Sad because these are things rarely talked about in teaching CS or college level teaching in general.</description>

      <title>Sharing Tab Missing in Windows Folder Properties</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Jan/10/Sharing-Tab-Missing-in-Windows-Folder-Properties</link>
      <description>For some unfathomable reason, Windows 11 has removed the Sharing Tab on the Explorer Properties Context menu by default. The Sharing Tab allows you to shared folders and drives for remote access. In this post I discuss how to get the Sharing Tab back and also touch on how to make sure your machine can actually accept remote connections so you can share your folders and drives.</description>

      <title>Nix from the bottom up</title>
      <link>http://www.chriswarbo.net/projects/nixos/bottom_up.html</link>
      <description>This page describes what Nix
fundamentally is, at its core; what it is actually doing when
it runs; and why it makes the choices that it does. This won’t tell you
what commands you need to run, or which of the Nixpkgs override
functions you should call to swap out that broken dependency you’ve
found; but hopefully it will give you a clearer picture of what’s
happening, what’s possible, and maybe steer you in the right
direction.</description>

Using a series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks, we show how even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can change an LLM&amp;#39;s answer.</description>

      <title>Quantifying your documentation&amp;#39;s success — Rami James</title>
      <link>https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/quantifying-your-documentations-success</link>
      <description>The primary challenge faced by technical writers often boils down to how to evaluate the effectiveness of what you write. You build some documentation and you think it is great. How do you know if you are right? How do you prove it to upper management? How do you really, really know?</description>

      <title>Understanding Bridge-Based Ranking</title>
      <link>https://jonathanwarden.com/understanding-bridge-based-ranking/</link>
      <description>Introduction Bridge-Based Ranking is an alternative way to score and rank content by adjusting for user polarization.
The most successful implementation of Bridge-Based Ranking, X&amp;amp;rsquo;s Community Notes, explains that the algorithm favors notes that are rated highly by users across a &amp;amp;ldquo;diversity of perspectives&amp;amp;rdquo;. But as I show in this article, ratings from users with diverse perspectives are not necessary for a note to rank highly. It is somewhat more accurate to say that the note must be highly rated regardless of diversity of perspective.</description>

      <title>Are any of your features the steak on the menu?</title>
      <link>https://ntietz.com/blog/the-steak-on-the-menu/</link>
      <description>At my first job, we were a distributed team and would get together often.
When we went out to eat, one of my coworkers would always order the steak if it was anywhere on the menu.
Every single time we went to some Ohio restaurant that had truly lackluster steak, he&amp;#39;d order it anyway.</description>

      <title>How to buy Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations, and how to get it for free</title>
      <link>https://micahflee.com/2024/01/how-to-buy-hacks-leaks-and-revelations-and-how-to-get-it-for-free/</link>
      <description>Today, my book Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data is available for sale wherever books are sold! My goal with this book is to teach journalists, researchers, and activists all the skills they need to download and analyze any datasets they get their hands on, finding all of the juicy revelations they might contain. No prior experience is required. You can think of following along with my book as taking a complete course where you&amp;#39;ll download real leaked datasets, and then (by following alongside the exercises) learn the tools and coding required to analyze them. The paperback costs about $50 and the ebook costs about $40. However, I don&amp;#39;t want the price to be a barrier to access to anyone who needs this information. For this reason, I also decided to release the book for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. In other words, I&amp;#39;m giving away the PDF version for free.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Plex Hosting After the Hetzner Ban</title>
      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/rethinking-plex-hosting-after-the-hetzner-ban/</link>
      <description>Last October, Plex started blocking access to instances running on servers hosted by Hetzner.
I have a Hetzner Auction server that I renew every year or so to make use of newer hardware, which I use to run various workloads, from web services, to scheduled jobs and self-hosted instances of privacy-friendly alternative web frontends like Nitter.
Another one of those workloads, until recently, was Plex.
I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t have the time to put too much effort into getting around the Hetzner network ban when it was first implemented, so I just started running Jellyfin instead.</description>
