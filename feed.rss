      <title>Too much efficiency makes everything worse: overfitting and the strong version of Goodhart’s law</title>

      <description>This blog is intended to be a place to share ideas and results that are too weird, incomplete, or off-topic to turn into an academic paper, but that I think may be important. Let me know what you think! Contact links to the left.</description>

      <title>RAG is not just text</title>
      <link>https://nishtahir.com/rag-is-not-just-text/</link>
      <description>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common pattern in AI-powered apps that allows a model to generate completions using context data that might not have been available during training. It&amp;#39;s beneficial when working with large language models because it helps the model make inferences on private data such as customer</description>

      <description>In my last TIL I talked about how to set additional security headers for Gitlab. But I also had to do this for other applications I was supporting, where it was more straight-forward to do it (meaning: with&amp;#160;code). I needed to set the access-control-allow-origin header in the other applications …</description>

      <title>Is Product Hunt dying?</title>
      <link>https://www.tetriz.io/blog/is-product-hunt-dying/</link>
      <description>Ok, that might be an overdramatic title but Product Hunt is currently facing some serious issues. Mainly, their rule to feature products are quite opaque and arbitrary. It is harder to be featured on the home page:  This September on average 16 launches are featured per day In September 2023 the average was 47  The issue is ever clearer when looking at the share of featured launches (vs all launches):  Last year between 60% and 98% of launches were featured.</description>

As I was flipping through its pages, a realization dawned on me with some force: I... love... calculator. I don&amp;#39;t mean as a physical device that you would wish to purchase and use today. I mean as a product of technology and a symbol of a kind of philosophy. Behold:</description>

      <title>Arch Linux and Valve Collaboration - Arch-dev-public</title>
      <link>https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/RIZSKIBDSLY4S5J2E2STNP5DH4XZGJMR/</link>
      <description>We are excited to announce that Arch Linux is entering into a direct 
collaboration with Valve. Valve is generously providing backing for two 
critical projects that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a 
build service infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting 
work on a freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on 
them without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers.

This opportunity allows us to address some of the biggest outstanding 
challenges we have been facing for a while. The collaboration will 
speed-up the progress that would otherwise take much longer for us to 
achieve, and will ultimately unblock us from finally pursuing some of 
our planned endeavors. We are incredibly grateful for Valve to make this 
possible and for their explicit commitment to help and support Arch Linux.

These projects will follow our usual development and consensus-building 
workflows. [RFCs] will be created for any wide-ranging changes. 
Discussions on this mailing list as well as issue, milestone and epic 
planning in our GitLab will provide transparency and insight into the 
work. We believe this collaboration will greatly benefit Arch Linux, and 
are looking forward to share further development on this mailing list as 
work progresses.
