      <title>Unit Testing in .NET - The Complete Guide</title>
      <link>https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/justmock/unit-testing-in-dotnet-the-complete-guide</link>
      <description>We all know that the most important criteria for choosing an application is its quality. One of the essential methods for improving application quality is writing a full set of unit tests. Comprehensive testing is even more crucial if you are starting a new project on one of the latest technologies, such as Blazor, Xamarin, .NET Core, or are looking into .NET 5.</description>

      <title>Deskreen</title>
      <link>https://www.deskreen.com/</link>
      <description>&amp;quot;It all started with me wanting to use my iPad as a second screen for my Macbook. But I found that it is already outdated to use a MacOS built in feature called &amp;#39;Sidecar&amp;#39; and I have to buy a new iPad. I also have a Windows PC and sometimes I needed to use my iPad as second screen for it as well. I tried to look for FREE solutions out there, but I could not find anything that would fit my requirements. Besides, all methods and software I found were different for Windows, Mac and Linux. I got very confused about it. Then I got an idea of creating Deskreen. I decided to make it free and open-source to help people to solve this problem. Deskreen works the same for Windows, MacOS and Linux.</description>

Before now, I had known him mostly for his cooking pictures on Twitter, the kind that made me envious of suburbanites and their 75,000 BTU woks. But now he was the test subject for my new project, to see if it was going to be fruitful or a waste of time.

      <title>Code Spotlight: the Reference Implementation of Ed25519 (Part 1)</title>
      <link>https://eiken.dev/blog/2020/11/code-spotlight-the-reference-implementation-of-ed25519-part-1/</link>
      <description>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has always been something I wanted to fully understand eventually. A recent project I worked on has brought me one step closer, but also revealed to me the true complexity of the topic. I am now convinced that I will probably never fully understand the maths behind ECC.
However, I discovered something else that I find interesting, although it’s not necessarily easier: implementing given schemes. In this post, I want to take you on a journey to explore a state-of-the-art implementation of a cryptographic scheme.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Code &amp;#187; Software effort estimation is mostly fake research</title>
      <link>http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2021/01/17/software-effort-estimation-is-mostly-fake-research/</link>
      <description>Effort estimation is an important component of any project, software or otherwise.  While effort estimation is something that everybody in industry is involved with on a regular basis, it is a niche topic in software engineering research.  The problem is researcher attitude (e.g., they are unwilling to venture into the wilds of industry), which has stopped them acquiring the estimation data needed to build realistic models.  A few intrepid people have risked an assault on their ego and talked to people in industry, the outcome has been, until very recently, a small collection of tiny estimation datasets.</description>
