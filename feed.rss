      <title>Why Great Engineering Orgs Thrive on &amp;quot;Normal&amp;quot; Engineers</title>
      <link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/10x-engineer</link>
      <description>Software engineer Charity Majors challenges the &amp;quot;10x engineer&amp;quot; myth, arguing that true productivity lies in team performance, not individual brilliance. She encourages building workplaces where &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; engineers can thrive. Are we focusing too much on hiring &amp;quot;the best&amp;quot; instead of the right people?</description>

      <description>Dave shows you a RIFA capacitor explosion and then explains what they are, what they&amp;#39;re for, why they fail so spectacularly, and whether or not you should proactively replace them.  Free Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM

Power supplies contain mains voltage when connected and their large capacitors can store dangerous charges for long periods; if in doubt, always contact a qualified technician.</description>

      <title>Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://planetbanatt.net/articles/modelmerging.html</link>
      <description>Model Merging is a weird and experimental technique which lets you take two models and combine them together to get a new model. This is primarily used in Large Language Models, where the likely convergent representations allow this technique to work somewhat better than you might expect, given the concept. Model merging techniques are interesting since they allow researchers to create new models which are somehow performant in new ways despite not doing any additional training. I think this is really weird, so I need to know about it.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of Showercoding – Thomas Dohmke</title>
      <link>https://ashtom.github.io/showercoding</link>
      <description>Vibecoding has struck Silicon Valley. The premise is simple: You envision it. You say it or prompt it. The AI delivers it. Rinse. Repeat. In a short time, 90-100% of all code will be written by AI. That means, apps, webpages, features, all will soon be built on the back of pure vibes.

      <title>Redis from scratch, or Cledis</title>
      <link>https://jagg.github.io/posts/cledis/</link>
      <description>This week I was looking for something new, and I realised that I’ve never tried to do any network programming using Common Lisp. Also, some time ago I came across the Build your own Redis book, but never tried to go through it. The project is perfect, it contains threading, networking, and even some async programming. I had no idea what the Common Lisp ecosystem for those things looks like, so it was time to find out.</description>

      <description>TLDR; The Zig compiler takes about 1 minute and 30 seconds to compile debug builds of Bun. Zig&amp;#39;s language server doesn&amp;#39;t do basic things like type-checking, so often have to run the compiler to see if my code works.</description>

      <link>https://woodruff.dev/decoding-http-response-codes-what-your-browser-isnt-telling-you/</link>
      <description>Every time you visit a website, your browser and the server have a little chat. Sometimes, that conversation goes smoothly; sometimes, there’s a misunderstanding, and sometimes, everything falls apart. HTTP response codes communicate success, confusion, or complete failure. If you’ve ever seen a dreaded 404 Not Found or a mysterious 500 Internal Server Error, you’ve already encountered them. But what do these numbers actually mean, and why should you care? Let’s break it down.</description>
