      <title>Web by Google (TM)</title>
      <link>https://landshark.io/2020/08/16/web-by-google.html</link>
      <description>Looking at Mozilla‚Äôs finances, it‚Äôs reasonable to conclude that Google is keeping them on life support to keep the anti-trust hounds at bay. Mozilla‚Äôs deal with Google will account for at least 70% of their revenues going forward. That‚Äôs over $400 million to be the default search provider in 4% of browsers. For 1 year. I‚Äôll bet my next paycheck that Google reupped this rather generous agreement to avoid a repeat of Microsoft‚Äôs troubles over an Internet Explorer monopoly. My guess is that Google will decide it‚Äôs in their interest to pull the plug right around the time this latest wave of anti-trust talk blows over.</description>

      <title>Fastest star ever seen is moving at 8% the speed of light</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2020-08-fastest-star.html</link>
      <description>In the center of our galaxy, hundreds of stars closely orbit a supermassive black hole. Most of these stars have large enough orbits that their motion is described by Newtonian gravity and Kepler's laws of motion. But a few orbit so closely that their orbits can only be accurately described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. The star with the smallest orbit is known as S62. Its closest approach to the black hole has it moving more than 8% of light speed.</description>
