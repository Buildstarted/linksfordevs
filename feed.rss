      <title>Questions about LLMs in Group Chats</title>
      <link>https://vineeth.io/posts/llm-groupchats</link>
      <description>Lately, I’ve been keeping a close eye on the xenocog community and projects that are spinning out of the ideas of the cyborgism and act 1 projects. However, in classic fashion, the aspects that are intriguing me the most are not what most people are interested in.</description>

      <title>A short history of AJAX and SSR</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/ajax-ssr/1/</link>
      <description>My journey in programming began over two decades ago, a time when JavaScript was a far cry from its current state, and developers were primarily focused on Microsoft Internet Explorer. One of my proudest achievements back then was writing a few lines of code that allowed users to add and remove table rows entirely on the client side. We called it DHTML. Many developers today have forgotten about it—or never knew it existed.   A few years later, AJAX emerged, revolutionizing the way we approached </description>

      <title>Kafka protocol practical guide - Ivan Yurchenko</title>
      <link>https://ivanyu.me/blog/2024/09/08/kafka-protocol-practical-guide/</link>
      <description>I worked with the Apache Kafka protocol on the low level quite a bit. It wasn’t easy to start doing this following the official guide only and I read the code a lot. With this post, I want to give you a head start by guiding you step by step from primitive values to meaningful requests.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://jasonfantl.com/posts/Collision-Avoidance/</link>
      <description>When you’re walking through a large crowd, how do you avoid colliding with everyone else? You aren’t communicating with each other, and you aren’t being directed by a central director, so how does the large crowd coordinate? Everyone is reacting independently using only their visual senses to estimate the velocity and size of everyone else, using that information to plan out a path to some goal.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#39;s hard to make progress on side projects sometimes.
Getting started is easy when we see the bright future of the project.
Then somewhere in the middle, we get stuck in lists of tasks to do, a long way in and still a long way from the finish line.</description>

      <title>Keeping your Dotfiles in Sync and your Secrets in Gopass</title>
      <link>https://blog.m5e.de/post/keeping-your-dotfiles-in-sync-and-your-secrets-in-gopass/</link>
      <description>Inspired by solutions how Secrets are being handled in corporate DevOps environments, I wanted to keep my Dotfiles on multiple machines in Sync and store all sensitive information inside gopass (which I started using instead of KeePass some time ago since I like the CLI and Unix / KISS aspect of it)
Luckily, I am not the first one to have such desires and I came across chezmoi which manages your Dotfiles for you inside a Git Repo and which also has support for gopass.</description>

      <title>What is the best pointer tagging method?</title>
      <link>https://coredumped.dev/2024/09/09/what-is-the-best-pointer-tagging-method/</link>
      <description>In this post, we are going to take a deep dive into pointer tagging, where metadata is encoded into a word-sized pointer. Doing so allows us to keep a compact representation that can be passed around in machine registers. This is very common in implementing dynamic programming languages, but can really be used anywhere that additional runtime information is needed about a pointer. We will look at a handful of different ways these pointers can be encoded and see how the compiler can optimize them for different hardware.</description>
