      <description>After upgrading to version 2.0.200729.8 of C++/WinRT, some customers reported that they lost the ability to co_await a std::future or a Concurrency::task. What happened? The relevant change is PR 702 which removed “vestigial support for free awaiters.” And that’s the part that’s relevant here.</description>

      <description>We've been big fans of the Thinkst [https://canary.tools] platform for a while
now. We may have mentioned them a time or two :) Like many others, we get a lot
of mileage out of their Canaries and Canary Tokens.

We also love TheHive [https://thehive-project.org/], as you probably already
know. As we've long touted, it makes tracking incidents easy, it's reliable, and
it's another well-managed open source project that we support and contribute to.

Part of our job at Recon relies on both of these</description>

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/</link>
      <description>Since .NET 5 was announced, many of you have asked what this means for .NET Standard and whether it will still be relevant. In this post, I’m going to explain how .NET 5 improves code sharing and replaces .NET Standard. I’ll also cover the cases where you still need .NET Standard.</description>

      <title>Security through obscurity isn't / Matiss Treinis</title>
      <link>https://matisstreinis.com/posts/security_through_obscurity_isnt/</link>
      <description>There has been a couple of posts (1, 2) on Reddit discussing an article Security by Obscurity is Underrated by Utku Şen.
Before going any further, you should probably read the linked article. In conclusion, however, the author makes a point that -
 Security by obscurity is not enough by itself. You should always enforce the best practices. However, if you can reduce the risk with zero cost, you should do that.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning, non-Markov environments, and memory</title>
      <link>https://flowing.systems/2020/09/15/reinforcement-learning-non-markov-memory.html</link>
      <description>I recently finished reading a reinforcement learning textbook (by Barto and Sutton), and throughout it I was constantly vexed by one important assumption that underlined all the algorithms: the Markov property, stating that a succeeding event depends only on the one preceding it, and not on ones far in the past. This kind of restriction is a helpful tool both practically and theoretically, but it causes problems when dealing with a rather natural situation where there is long-term dependence between events. The book doesn’t address this, so I tried to, and found out it’s a genuine problem with real research behind it. Here’s what I did.</description>

      <title>Searching for style</title>
      <link>https://jacobjackson.com/searching-for-style/</link>
      <description>It’s interesting to watch young children use home assistants. They treat them like people, asking questions like “Alexa, how are you feeling?” and “Alexa, where are you?”. I often wonder what their motivation is. Maybe they don’t know the responses are scripted. Maybe the designers’ choice of which response to script is just as interesting to them as a human’s response would be.
Adults are no less inclined to anthropomorphization—Alexa is marketed as a her and not an it—but they’ve grown used to Alexa’s shortcomings as a conversationalist.</description>
