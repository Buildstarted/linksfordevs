      <title>Can You Grok It :: dade</title>
      <link>https://0xda.de/blog/2024/04/can-you-grok-it/</link>
      <description>My friend sent me a tunnel link where he had to manually set it up with socat and his nginx ingress controller in his k8s cluster. He made an offhand comment about needing a better way to setup tunnels and it got me thinking. This post is the result of a long night of hacking away at my own tunnel solution.
If you want to jump into the nitty gritty of how it works, you can skip to Roll Your Own Tunnel.</description>

      <description>Software scalability isn&amp;#39;t just a fancy engineering exercise. It&amp;#39;s a game where businesses need to level up. And if you can’t figure out how to play the game, you’ll probably never succeed to move your architecture to the next level.</description>

      <title>Implementing an SHA transformer by hand</title>
      <link>https://andrew.gr/stories/sha/</link>
      <description>So the first question, you, and any reasonable person, may have when
seeing this post title is &amp;quot;why?? why would you ever do this?&amp;quot; Well, I
have a pretty good reason—Andis and I came up with a scheme to insert
undetectable backdoors into transformers, but it depends on
having a &amp;quot;submodule&amp;quot; which can compute a pretty strong hash. SHA-2 is a great
candidate for this—not least because its Wikipedia article actually has
pseudocode for its implementation—so now all we have to do is make a
transformer which, given some input, places that input&amp;#39;s hash into the
residual stream.</description>

      <title>My Cat Alerted Me to a DDoS Attack</title>
      <link>https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/my-cat-alerted-me-to-a-ddos-attack</link>
      <description>A few years ago, my cat gave me my most memorable middle of the night software
engineering incident. I was working at a startup, and we didn’t have a formal
on-call rotation yet. That was a deliberate decision, since being on-call is
painful, and the team was good about just collectively keeping an eye out for
urgent alerts. We eventually set up an on-call rotation, but before that
happened, I had a fun night.</description>

      <description>I’m a surgeon. I’d like to think that I’m resilient and well adjusted, having gone through medical school and rigorous surgical training. I’ve been a doctor for 13 years and much of that period has been spent training to be as good a surgeon as I could ever be. I have great family support, a physician wife who understands my work and I’ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness.</description>

exception handling as its only form of control flow.
Much of the syntax is unsurprising, but the forms of exception raising and

and you&amp;#39;ll likely get ten different opinions. Worse, these opinions are almost
never based on facts. Instead, when you ask why they prefer style X over Y the
answer is almost always the equivalent of &amp;quot;I just do&amp;quot;.</description>
