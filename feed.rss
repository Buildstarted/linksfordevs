      <title>Never trust a programmer who says he knows C++ by Louis Brandy</title>
      <link>http://lbrandy.com/blog/2010/03/never-trust-a-programmer-who-says-he-knows-c/</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been in an interviewing mindset for awhile and I&amp;#39;ve come to realize something important about C++ in particular. C++ is a &amp;quot;two peak&amp;quot; language. That is to say C++ is the only language I know of where two very different sets of programmers consider themselves well versed in the language. Let me show you in fake graph form:</description>

      <title>Wolves make roadways safer, generating large economic returns to predator conservation</title>
      <link>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/22/e2023251118</link>
      <description>Measuring the economic benefits conveyed by predators is difficult—often, effects are indirect and operate through complex ecological changes. As a result, debates about the expansion of predators have pit salient costs against more speculative estimates of benefits that might be dismissed as unreliable or ideologically motivated. We quantify the indirect benefits of wolves ( Canis lupus ) to human lives and property through reductions in deer-vehicle collisions. Moreover, we decompose the effect into two components: changes in prey behavior versus prey abundance. This decomposition is important when effective policy depends on whether hunters can replicate the effects of predators. In the case of wolves, we conclude that human deer hunters cannot.

The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available in Dryad at &amp;lt;https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g4f4qrfp8&amp;gt;. This paper does not use any custom algorithms.</description>

      <title>LLVM relicensing update &amp;amp; call for help</title>
      <link>https://blog.llvm.org/posts/2021-11-18-relicensing-update/</link>
      <description>In this blog post, I’d like to summarize the main points I talked about in the relicensing update presentation at the 2021 LLVM Developer’s meeting.
The very short summary is that we are currently in the long tail phase of collecting relicensing agreements of past contributors.</description>
