      <title>Temporal circuit of macroscale dynamic brain activity supports human consciousness</title>
      <link>https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/11/eaaz0087</link>
      <description>The ongoing stream of human consciousness relies on two distinct cortical systems, the default mode network and the dorsal attention network, which alternate their activity in an anticorrelated manner. We examined how the two systems are regulated in the conscious brain and how they are disrupted when consciousness is diminished. We provide evidence for a “temporal circuit” characterized by a set of trajectories along which dynamic brain activity occurs. We demonstrate that the transitions between default mode and dorsal attention networks are embedded in this temporal circuit, in which a balanced reciprocal accessibility of brain states is characteristic of consciousness. Conversely, isolation of the default mode and dorsal attention networks from the temporal circuit is associated with unresponsiveness of diverse etiologies. These findings advance the foundational understanding of the functional role of anticorrelated systems in consciousness.</description>

      <description>Over the past year or so, I’ve reluctantly come to the conclusion I need to
leave Elm and migrate to some other language (most
likely Bucklescript via philip2), and I definitely cannot recommend it

the way in which the leadership behave.</description>

      <description>Unfriendly comments are an issue in our system because of the effect that their tone has on their recipient’s and future readers’ willingness to contribute to Stack Overflow. The solution to these issues isn’t to argue about circumstance or intent. The only remaining option is to work on the comments themselves.</description>

      <title>On architecture, urban planning and software construction</title>
      <link>http://tomasp.net/blog/2020/cities-and-programming/</link>
      <description> Like software construction, architecture and urban planning often deal with
complex systems that evolve over a long period of time. Some of the successful systems are
also quite messy despite theories telling us that such systems should not work. These are just
a few of the reasons why software engineers can learn interesting things from reading about
architecture and urban planning.</description>

      <description>In the previous post in this series we mentioned the concept of superposition briefly. Let's use this second part to dive deeper into the mathematics of it, meet the cat of Schrödinger and try to find some simple quantum computing use cases for it.</description>

      <title>Uno Platform 2.1 available now - x:Bind, TwoPaneView and more - Uno Platform</title>
      <link>https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-2-1-available-now-xbind-dualpaneview-and-more/</link>
      <description>Uno Platform 2.1 release is packed with over 50 new features allowing for increased productivity as well as getting you up and running with Surface Duo. In addition to bigger milestones such as x:Bind, the TwoPaneView and NumberBox controls we also shipped another 50 new features and closed 45 issues you raised. Without further ado: x:Bind functions Uno has been supporting some form of x:Bind markup for properties, binding to functions were a big ask from users of Uno, as it allows for invoking methods from code behind very easily. Two of the largest use of x:Bind functions is to reduce the use of converters, and the use of static properties. Another use of the x:Bind is familiar to WPF developers, where binding to multiple properties is also available. You’ll find below some examples of the x:Bind feature. Member Function, to make a string upper case: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind MyProperty.ToUpper()}" /&gt; Static type fields or properties OneTime binding: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind local:StaticType.PropertyIntValue}" /&gt; OneWay local member function with multiple observable parameters: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Multiply(slider1.Value, slider2.Value), Mode=OneWay}" /&gt; Literal boolean parameters: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind BoolFunc(x:False)}" /&gt; Literal numeric value: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind Add(InstanceProperty, 42.42)}" /&gt; Use of system functions such as: &lt;TextBlock Text="{x:Bind sys:String.Format('Formatted {0}', …</description>
