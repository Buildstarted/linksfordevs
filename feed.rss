      <description>I’ve now been working in Shanghai for over 5 years, and 14 months in a Chinese company using Mandarin as the main working language. So here I list the lessons I took from the past year — many things I should have done better, or things I’ve seen happen in other companies through stories from […]</description>

      <title>How does B-tree make your queries fast?</title>
      <link>https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/11/how-does-btree-make-your-queries-fast.html</link>
      <description>B-tree is a structure that helps to search through great amounts of data.
It was invented over 40 years ago, yet it is still employed by the majority of modern databases.
Although there are newer index structures, like LSM trees,
B-tree is unbeaten when handling most of the database queries.

      <link>https://notes.alinpanaitiu.com/Costs-of-running-a-macOS-app-studio-business</link>
      <description>I created The low-tech guys, a brand under which I develop macOS apps for a living. I started this business with a good friend of mine, thinking I could help him stop working long hours at his consulting job and ease into more creative work. However, getting to a state where you earn enough to live off the app sales takes time, and he did not have that time. So it&amp;#39;s just one &amp;quot;low-tech guy&amp;quot; doing all this, and that is me. ...</description>

      <title>Having A Game I’m Really Into Makes Every Day Incredibly Enjoyable | Plumshell</title>
      <link>http://plumshell.com/2023/12/23/having-a-game-im-really-into-makes-every-day-incredibly-enjoyable/</link>
      <description>About a month ago, I became hooked on mahjong, the ultimate game. It&amp;#39;s a bit late in my life to start, but that&amp;#39;s how it is.   In the past, I might have thought, &amp;quot;Playing games like this would be ruinous, leading to personal downfall.&amp;quot; But now, as I&amp;#39;ve grown older, I&amp;#39;ve stopped worrying about these concerns and am thoroughly enjoying this obsession. I&amp;#39;m living in the moment.   Throughout my life, I&amp;#39;ve only occasionally found activities so captivating that I&amp;#39;d sacrifice sleep for them, perhaps once every five years.   First, there was soccer in elementary school, then guitar and drums in high school. After that, I got into FPS games and eventually found programming, which led to a career. Later, I enjoyed reading comics and books at a leisurely pace; it was more of a gradual enjoyment rather than an obsession that would cost me sleep.   A few years ago, I had a brief but intense period of playing Valorant, another FPS game. The daily happiness and the time spent improving during that</description>

It comes down to sorting by timestamp…</description>

      <description>It’s two years since we launched Mwmbl, the open source, non-profit search engine, on Boxing Day 2021. A good time to take stock of where we are and where we’re going.
We’ve indexed over 100 million pages Thanks to our volunteers, who crawl the web using the Firefox extension and command line script, we’re crawling up to a million pages a day, as you can see on our stats page. There are around 50-60 users crawling on an average day.</description>
