      <title>My 2,718281828459045235 Cents - State Of AI: Year 3 of the hype. Things I learned.</title>
      <link>https://nickyreinert.de/2025/2025-08-01-mtc---state-of-ai/</link>
      <description>What about coding People don’t get tired of announcing that AI will replace developers. Mostly salespeople. Microsoft claims that AI is already writing 30–50% of their code. They also admit, that quality of C+ is behind expectations. In 2030 they plan to reach a rate of 95%, though human oversight and authorship remains important. But they are silent about further details. I am not totally disagreeing, but I am pretty sure that there’s still a bumpy road ahead. You may argue: Well, then you don’t know how to properly operate AI. Problem usually sits in front of the screen, as they say. Fair enough. That’s why I want to share some thoughts and experiences.</description>

      <description>LinkedIn reports that "the majority of U.S. professionals (58%) believe they have a wide range of skills that are being underutilized in their current roles."

I see you. I know you. I am you.

I have felt this in every job I've had in the last ten years. Years</description>

      <description>The current administration in the US has, through various funding agencies such as the NSF and NIH, has recently suspended virtually all federal grants to my home  university, UCLA (including my own personal grant, although that is far from the most serious impact of this decision), on the grounds that UCLA was “failing to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias”.  One can certainly debate whether these grounds were justified, or whether they merit the extremely draconian damage to the very research environment that this decision is claiming to protect, but if nothing else this unprecedented decision does not appear to have followed the usual standards of due process for actions of this nature; for instance, there appears to have been no good faith effort by the administration to receive a response from UCLA to its allegations before implementing its decision.

The suspension of my personal grant has a non-trivial impact on myself (in particular, my summer salary, which I had already deferred in order to allow the previously released NSF funds to support several of my graduate students over this period, is now in limbo), and now gives me almost no resources to support my graduate students going forward; but this is only a fraction of a percent of the entire amount being suspended.  A far greater concern is the impact on the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/, which despite receiving preliminary approval earlier this year for a new five-year round of funding (albeit at significantly reduced levels) from the NSF, now only has enough emergency funding for a few months of further operation at best if the suspension is not lifted.

      <title>I couldn't submit a PR, so I got hired and fixed it myself</title>
      <link>https://www.skeptrune.com/posts/doing-the-little-things/</link>
      <description>After joining Mintlify (which acquired my previous company), I finally fixed a search bug that had bothered me for over a year as a user - the debounced search queries weren't being aborted, causing race conditions and poaor search quality. By adding an AbortController to ensure only the most recent search query returns results, I made the search experience crisper and more responsive across their 30,000+ documentation</description>
