      <description>In this all code/no slides session, Damian and David cover the depths of the .NET 6 and .NET 7 wave. Let’s talk about why your app isn’t scaling, what you need to know about modern .NET apps, great patterns, app development in the cloud and much more. We will also ask the question “what’s the smallest .NET app possible?” and try to answer it live on stage.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Breakout: BRK203H | English (US) This session was delivered as part of the Microsoft Ignite 2022 event.

      <title>Killing one bird with two-and-a-half stones in Mac OS X Mail - Tech Reflect</title>
      <link>https://techreflect.net/2022/10/killing-one-bird-with-two-and-a-half-stones-in-mac-os-x-mail/</link>
      <description>This story is important to me because it was the first software I ever wrote that shipped to more than just a few friends or colleagues. What started as some scripting turned into Cocoa development, which is not something I ever expected to find myself doing. It never became a full-time thing for me, but it was a fun journey. Note: I joined the Mail team in June 2000, three months before the Public Beta. We shipped the first “real” version of Mac OS X (10.0) nine months later. On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah).&amp;#160;The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers.&amp;#160;While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac... Read More Read More</description>

      <title>Python isn’t Used in Prod</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2022/10/19/python-isnt-used-in-prod/</link>
      <description>I watched a video earlier this week by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. It’s an entertaining walkthrough of some impressive optimisation of his own Python code by his community but there’s a comment about Python that I thought warranted some pushback.
That comment was that ‘Python will very rarely make it into production’. The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work.</description>

      <description>This was a talk I gave at the Software You Can Love 2022 conference. You can find the slides right here (PDF).
Today I want to tell you a story about the time I ported the Zig compiler to SerenityOS.
I’m going to tell you a bit about what my motivation was to do this. Then I’ll explain the steps I took and the various challenges I faced (there were a lot of those!</description>
