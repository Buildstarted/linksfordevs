      <title>How to buy Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations, and how to get it for free</title>
      <link>https://micahflee.com/2024/01/how-to-buy-hacks-leaks-and-revelations-and-how-to-get-it-for-free/</link>
      <description>Today, my book Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data is available for sale wherever books are sold! My goal with this book is to teach journalists, researchers, and activists all the skills they need to download and analyze any datasets they get their hands on, finding all of the juicy revelations they might contain. No prior experience is required. You can think of following along with my book as taking a complete course where you&amp;#39;ll download real leaked datasets, and then (by following alongside the exercises) learn the tools and coding required to analyze them. The paperback costs about $50 and the ebook costs about $40. However, I don&amp;#39;t want the price to be a barrier to access to anyone who needs this information. For this reason, I also decided to release the book for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. In other words, I&amp;#39;m giving away the PDF version for free.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Plex Hosting After the Hetzner Ban</title>
      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/rethinking-plex-hosting-after-the-hetzner-ban/</link>
      <description>Last October, Plex started blocking access to instances running on servers hosted by Hetzner.
I have a Hetzner Auction server that I renew every year or so to make use of newer hardware, which I use to run various workloads, from web services, to scheduled jobs and self-hosted instances of privacy-friendly alternative web frontends like Nitter.
Another one of those workloads, until recently, was Plex.
I didn&amp;amp;rsquo;t have the time to put too much effort into getting around the Hetzner network ban when it was first implemented, so I just started running Jellyfin instead.</description>

      <description>The following joke was posted to an internal Magenic list. I don&amp;#39;t know who actually wrote it, and I&amp;#39;ll give credit if someone points out the creator of the joke. It perfectly illustrates what I think developers (especially consultants) have to go through all the time when they&amp;#39;re interviewing for the next gig.</description>
