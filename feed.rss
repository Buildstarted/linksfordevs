      <title>Displaying Lists Efficiently in Blazor -- Visual Studio Magazine</title>

      <description>Blazor&amp;#39;s Virtualize component will let you display long lists faster without writing a lot of code. If you want to take full advantage of the component, however, you&amp;#39;ll need a relatively smart repository to back it up.</description>

      <description>GNU Units converts quantities expressed in various
systems of measurement to their equivalents in other systems of
measurement.  Like many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative
scale changes. It can also handle nonlinear conversions such as
Fahrenheit to Celsius or wire gauge, and it can convert from and to sums of
units, such as converting between meters and feet plus inches.</description>

      <title>How can I tell whether my process is running as SYSTEM? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210106-00/?p=104669</link>
      <description>A customer wanted to know how to check whether the current process is running as the SYSTEM account. They proposed this algorithm: // Code in italics is wrong bool IsCurrentProcessRunningAsSystem() {  DWORD session_id;  return ProcessIdToSessionId(GetCurrentProcessId(), &amp;amp;session_id) &amp;amp;&amp;amp;     session_id == 0; }  This algorithm is flawed both for the possibility of false positives as well as false negatives.</description>

      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Jan/05/Blank-Zero-Values-in-CSharp-Number-Format-Strings</link>
      <description>Recently needed a way to display a set of numbers in a WPF List display that required that values with a value of `0` display blank - using no explicit code or model changes. I learnt something new today: There&amp;#39;s actually a way to use C# format strings to format numbers separately for positive, negative and zero values. Here&amp;#39;s how that works.</description>

      <title>Episode‌ ‌8:‌ ‌Breaking‌ ‌Elliptic-Curve‌ ‌Signatures‌ ‌With‌ ‌LadderLeak!‌</title>
      <link>https://www.cryptography.fm/8</link>
      <description>LadderLeak is a new attack that exploits side channels present in ECDSA, claiming to allow real-world breaking of ECDSA with less than a bit of nonce leakage. But what does “less than a bit” mean in this context? Is LadderLeak really that effective at breaking ECDSA, with so little information to go on? Joining us this episode are LadderLeak co-authors Akira Takahashi, Mehdi Tibouchi and Yuval Yarom to discuss these questions and more.</description>

      <description>Some of the best advice I&amp;#39;ve received has been to turn short-term games into long-term games. In the past, I interpreted this as prioritize actions that further long-term goals over those that generate short-term rewards. After digging a bit deeper and thinking at a different level of abstraction, I now see this piece of advice in a different dimension.</description>
