      <description>F# is about clarity of thinking and expression - ‚Äúcomputational thinking made manifest‚Äù - and is loved by academics and researchers
for bringing clear, concise problem solving techniques developed in academia into practice. 
F# is both based on academic research and acts as an inspiration for thousands of 
students and researchers worldwide. Many standard F# features (including active patterns and asynchronous workflows)

      <title>Tip 253 - Use Ingress Controller to access resources in an Azure Virtual Network</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip253.html</link>
      <description>In a recent customer engagement, they wanted to access all the AKS services via an Azure virtual network. This customer's application is not an external facing and needs to be on a corporate network to access their resources (e.g. HR, payroll,procurement etc..) If you are familiar with the Kubernetes eco system, we can use NGINX ingress controller to expose Kubernetes services on an external IP address. Azure Kubernetes Services comes to the rescue. AKS provides an option to deploy your NGINX ingress controller on an internal network which keeps the resources accessible only on an internal network and can be accessible via Express Route or VPN.</description>
