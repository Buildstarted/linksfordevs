      <title>C++ coroutines: Converting among tasks that use the same promise | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210503-00/?p=105173</link>
      <description>If the only difference between tasks is in the awaiter, then it’s possible to convert between them without the promise even knowing what happened. We have an example of this with our simple_task and com_simple_task, which differ only in the awaiter produced by the co_await operator.</description>

      <title>How Tech Loses Out over at Companies, Countries and Continents - Articles</title>
      <link>https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/how-tech-loses-out/</link>
      <description>Hi everyone,
This is a transcript of my presentation over at the European Microwave Week 2020, actually held in 2021. You can find the video here and the slides here. I’d like to thank Frank van Vliet, general chair of the EMW, for inviting me to do this talk.
The words have only been edited lightly - it is still presentation style, so here and there the sentences are not written like how they’d be in a more formal piece of work.</description>

      <title>Rust&amp;#39;s Most Unrecognized Contributor</title>
      <link>https://brson.github.io/2021/05/02/rusts-most-unrecognized-contributor</link>
      <description>I think the Rust language is a big success.
When I think back on it I am in awe:
so much had to go right to get where we are,
and there were so many opportunities to go wrong.
It took many tiny miracles for the Rust language to become what it has.
Those miracles didn’t happen by accident though:
each one was created by a real person,
and real people orchestrated them to become something great.</description>

      <title>The Tale of One-way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012023</link>
      <description>The existence of one-way functions is arguably the most important problem in
computer theory. The article discusses and refines a number of concepts
relevant to this problem. For instance, it gives the first combinatorial
complete owf, i.e., a function which is one-way if any function is. There are
surprisingly many subtleties in basic definitions. Some of these subtleties are
discussed or hinted at in the literature and some are overlooked. Here, a
unified approach is attempted.</description>

      <title>On using to-do lists efficiently</title>
      <link>https://bzg.fr/en/on-using-to-do-lists-efficiently/</link>
      <description>My happiness results from keeping a sane balance between achievements and what Jim Carrey calls &amp;quot;freedom of concern&amp;quot;1. I like to work and I love to daydream. As much as daydreaming is about wandering, work and personal achievements are about focusing, which in turn requires motivation, clarity of purpose and control, all of them sustained by discipline.
 Very often, your to-do list becomes your enemy. Because it gives you a false sense of control, it slowly erodes your goals&amp;#39; clarity, which weakens your motivation.</description>
