      <title>Keep your casing with Case-preserving Find and Replace - Visual Studio Blog</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/keep-your-casing-with-case-preserving-find-and-replace/</link>
      <description>The Visual Studio search experience is getting a new feature that allows users to find and replace text without having to worry about different casings. For example, a method parameter `catalogItemId` and object property `CatalogItemId` have the same name but different capitalization but should both be replaced by something like ‘productId’ with their respective casings.&amp;#160;</description>

      <title>Using Docker environment variables at JavaScript runtime</title>
      <link>https://dotnetthoughts.net/using-docker-environment-variables-at-javascript-runtime/</link>
      <description>When creating a container for a single-page application with JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js, we may have to inject certain configuration variables based the deployment environment. A common scenario is using API endpoint URL for the Javascript application which can vary depend on the environment. In Angular, we can use environment file for this purpose. But again the problem is we have to hard code the API URL in the environment file. In this post we will explore how we can do configure container environment variable in vanilla Javascript. This technique can be used in any Javascript framework or technology.</description>

      <description>During my lifetime, I have met with people who had certain skills, like reading the weather, or knowing a technical subject inside out, or being able to learn pretty quickly while being thorough. I have admired these people, and wanted to learn what made them tick. The main question was &amp;quot;How is this possible, and what can I learn from these people&amp;quot;, and the feeling accompanying this question was always a healthy wonder and awe, not envy or anger.</description>

      <description>Our performance ratings influence our ability to get raises, promotions, and our long term career success. They&amp;#39;re not a simple meritocracy, but are a coarse-grained way of estimating our value to our company. Here&amp;#39;s a bit on making certain you get a rating you deserve.</description>

      <title>Wayland and screen savers</title>
      <link>https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/09/wayland-and-screen-savers/</link>
      <description>Wayland does not support screen savers: it does not have any provision that allows screen savers to even exist in any meaningful way. If you value screen savers, that&amp;#39;s kind of a problem. Why doesn&amp;#39;t it? Well, I suppose the designers of Wayland have no joy in their cold, black hearts simply do not value screen savers. I suspect that some day someone will graft screen saver support onto ...</description>

      <title>How to write a renderer for modern graphics APIs</title>
      <link>https://blog.mecheye.net/2023/09/how-to-write-a-renderer-for-modern-apis/</link>
      <description>Tell me if this sounds familiar. You want to write a renderer. OpenGL seems beginner-friendly, and there’s lots of tutorials for you to get started, but you also know it’s deprecated, kind of dead, and mocked; not for “real graphics programmers”, whatever that means. Its replacement, Vulkan, seems daunting and scary to learn, tutorials seem to spin for hours without seeing a single pixel on the screen, and by the time you’re done, you’re no closer to making that low-latency twitchy multiplayer FPS game you’ve always wanted to make.</description>

      <title>Vector search for dummies</title>
      <link>https://philbooth.me/blog/vector-search-for-dummies</link>
      <description>Recently I built a system
that uses vector search to logically truncate long documents
and retain the most significant parts
according to some search term.
I&amp;#39;m a dummy,
with no background in machine learning or mathematics,
so there were new concepts for me to understand
and implementation details to figure out.
This post summarises what I learned.</description>

      <title>Why is Bitwarden returning 503s to my Windows app?</title>
      <link>https://www.lkoskela.fi/blog/2023-09-02-wden-windows-503/</link>
      <description>For a few years now, I&amp;#39;ve been developing a TUI Bitwarden client app called Wden. While Bitwarden does not have a stable API for writing alternative clients, the APIs for the official clients have been pretty well documented by third parties. It&amp;#39;s not too difficult to write a client against those, but it will occasionally break when Bitwarden makes changes to their servers.</description>
