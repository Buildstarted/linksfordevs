      <link>http://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/scott-hunter-on-preparing-for-net-6-episode-152</link>
      <description>This week, Jeffrey is rejoined by return guest, Scott Hunter! Scott is the Director of Program Management for .NET at Microsoft.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; When Scott first joined Microsoft back in 2007, he was working on the ASP.NET team. As the Director of Program Management of .NET, Scott and his team build .NET Core, .NET Framework, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, managed languages (C#/F#/VB), as well as the Web and .NET Tooling for Visual Studio. &amp;amp;nbsp; The last time Scott was on the podcast, he and Jeffrey spoke about .NET 5. Now, less than a year later, the release of .NET 6 is coming up. In this episode, Scott speaks about the changes that he and his team have been working on developing, what developers should currently be paying attention to in preparation for the release of .NET 6, the biggest changes from .NET 5 to .NET 6 that developers can look forward to, and his insights on .NET MAUI, C# 10.0, .NET Upgrade Assistant, Visual Studio 2022, and more! If you’re a developer awaiting the release of .NET 6 or are currently experimenting with .NET 5, you should be tuning in to today’s conversation! &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:14] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:23] About today’s episode with return guest, Scott Hunter! [1:35] Jeffrey welcomes Scott to the podcast. [2:14] What developers should be paying attention to as the .NET 6 release approaches? [5:16] Will .NET Upgrade Assistant be built in to Visual Studio 2022 or is it a side tool? [6:16] Does .NET Upgrade Assistant function on all of the recent .NET versions? [6:36] For those with extensive web form applications, does .NET Upgrade Assistant know that you’re on your own or will it convert the rest of the solution and leave the web forms? Scott gives his recommendations for web form customers. [7:37] Scott shares what one of their big goals are as a team for .NET 6 and his recommendations for customers looking to go from .NET 5 to 6. [9:05] Scott talks about the tooling experience they’re trying to create with .NET 6 and one of the biggest changes on the tooling side in the .NET 6 space: hot reload. [15:09] A word from The Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [15:40] How Scott and his team are working toward making .NET more approachable for all developers. [20:40] How many of the changes that Scott has talked about will be making the .NET 6 release? [23:05] Jeffrey and Scott talk .NET MAUI and building mobile apps. [29:50] Leading up to the .NET Conf, what should developers be paying attention to? [31:30] Would Scott say that .NET 6 is Microsoft’s biggest release in a while? [32:58] Jeffrey thanks Scott for joining the show! &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!

      <description>This article will discuss about implementing Authentication of ASP.NET Core MVC applications with Azure Active Directory B2C. Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a cloud identity management solution for web and mobile apps. The service provides authentication for apps hosted in the cloud and on-premises. I couldn’t find any documentation on how to use Azure AD B2C in ASP.NET Core MVC applications. In this blog post we will explore how to use User flows - which is a customization feature offered by Azure B2C.</description>

      <title>The emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance</title>
      <link>https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaaw1838</link>
      <description>Humans’ ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35&amp;#176;C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35&amp;#176;C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35&amp;#176;C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35&amp;#176;C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe.</description>
