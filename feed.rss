      <description>If you&amp;#39;re interested in startups, &amp;quot;Do things that don&amp;#39;t scale&amp;quot; is something you&amp;#39;ve likely heard. To me it&amp;#39;s execution advice - in the beginning use your relatively small size as a strength by doing things that have outsized short term impact but are infeasible in the long run at scale.</description>

      <title>Customer Communication During Incidents The How to of Status Page Updates</title>
      <link>https://iamevan.me/categories/sre/customer-communication-during-incidents-the-how-to-of-status-page-updates/</link>
      <description>Something often overlooked during an incident is how we communicate with our customers and reassure them of the situation. How you convey an incident to the people paying for your service can make all the difference when it comes to contract renewal period. At a past company, our sales team regularly reported back from client meetings that they consistently mentioned how helpful and reassuring status page updates from the SRE team were, even when our service was fully down.</description>

      <description>Blogs have mostly died over the last 10 years. Of course, if you’re reading this, that must be false? Sure. Yes, there are 600 million blogs and WordPress is the world’s most popular content platform. Technically these are blogs, but not in the way that the word was originally used.

      <description>There is a misconception that you need permission to start a business. The received wisdom suggests that your path should be Undergraduate Degree &amp;gt; Work Experience &amp;gt; Masters in Business Administration &amp;gt; Business Internship &amp;gt; Work Experience &amp;gt; And at this point you begin to feel you might have permission from society to create a business.</description>

      <title>Mark Okhakumhe - Intellectual Property Rights in the Technology Sector [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF_HOeJh2Dw</link>
      <description>The slave who made the whiskey, Jack Daniel, was not given recognition until 2016. This recognition was 150 years late. This is not an isolated incident as there are several instances in the past where inventions and ideas by black people were stolen.

So much has changed all over the world, especially in countries where the rights of black people have always been a subject of constant discourse. A 2016 study found that black Americans “apply for patents at nearly half the rate of whites&amp;quot;. This shows that a lot still needs to done to protect the intellectual property rights of black people in tech.

In my session, I will address the subject of what intellectual property rights are, how they can be protected and what the black community can do to help facilitate this protection. I will speak on the jurisdictional nature of intellectual property rights and why it is important for black people in tech to apply for triadic or international patents.

      <description>I saw Martin Kleppmann’s talk a few weeks ago about CRDTs, and I felt a deep sense of despair. Maybe all the work I’ve been doing for the past decade won’t be part of the future after all, because Martin’s work on CRDTs will supersede it.</description>
