      <title>Databinding with the OOP Windows Forms Designer</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/databinding-with-the-oop-windows-forms-designer/</link>
      <description>The design-time support for databinding in the new Windows Forms (WinForms) .NET Out of Process (OOP) Designer is different from the Framework Designer. The WinForms OOP Designer has a new and easier approach for hooking up data sources, focusing on Object Data Sources to support .NET based object relational mapper technologies (like the latest version of Entity Framework Core – EF Core for short) which the WinForms team recommends as a successor for Typed DataSets.</description>

      <title>The GNU Name System</title>
      <link>https://lsd.gnunet.org/lsd0001/</link>
      <description>This document contains the GNU Name System (GNS) technical
      specification.
      GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant name
      system that provides a privacy-enhancing alternative to the Domain
      Name System (DNS).
       
       
      This document defines the normative wire format of resource records,
      resolution processes, cryptographic routines and security
      considerations for use by implementers.
      It is published here to inform readers about the function
      of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure
      interoperability among implementations including with the
      pre-existing GNUnet implementation.
       
       
      This specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have
      IETF consensus.  It is published here to guide implementation of GNS
      and to ensure interoperability among implementations.</description>

      <description>WebAssembly is at an inflection point. Over the next few years, I expect to see increased adoption of WebAssembly across the tech sphere, from containerization to plugin systems to serverless computing platforms. The following is a discussion of what WebAssembly is, what makes it a relevant technology, and where it’s being used today. I’ll also describe some potentially high-impact applications and make some predictions about its future.</description>

Below is the excerpt of that story in her own words.
 It reminds me, I sometimes tell this story about my eldest son.</description>
