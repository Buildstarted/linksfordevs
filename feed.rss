      <title>Tech Companies Are MISSING OUT On Prioritizing This Skill</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=wFxAGUiiPIU</link>
      <description>And what could this super important skill be that tech companies aren&amp;#39;t putting priority on?

JavaScript? Postgres? Blazor?

Is it some other programming language or tech stack? Or maybe some other technical skills like debugging?

... Think again.

In this video, let&amp;#39;s jump over to Reddit and read through this realization from a software engineer that after FIVE years he claims &amp;quot;I realize companies don&amp;#39;t place value on this&amp;quot;.

      <title>Finally! Azure Service Bus Emulator is Now Available!</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=DcIXUWzK3BE</link>
      <description>Are you building a scalable, decoupled application together with a service bus? 

If you&amp;#39;re using Azure Service Bus, you&amp;#39;ve probably felt the pain of local development!

Up until now, there hasn&amp;#39;t been a way to work with Azure Service Bus without setting that up in Azure, which costs money, and requires you to always be online. 

Let me introduce the Azure Service Bus Emulator that solves this problem. You can now run the emulator in docker, locally, and point your application to the local instance. This will let you build an application that uses Azure Service Bus without relying on Azure during the development process!

Join me in this video where we explore this new tool, and set it up using .NET Aspire!

      <title>Insane performance boost in EF core using bulk operations #dotnet #aspnetcore #csharp #efcore</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=pl6Whl1Xji0</link>
      <description>In this video, I dive into the insane performance boost you can achieve in .NET  by leveraging bulk operations with ExecuteUpdateAsync and ExecuteDeleteAsync from EF Core. I demonstrate two approaches for updating and deleting records: the traditional method that loads entities into memory and processes them using foreach loops, and the optimized bulk operation method. The difference? 6 seconds vs. 0.1 seconds!</description>

      <title>Wireguard: Beyond the most basic configuration</title>
      <link>https://sloonz.github.io/posts/wireguard-beyond-basic-configuration/</link>
      <description>Last week I wanted to replace my OpenVPN setup with WireGuard. The basics were well-documented, going beyond the basics was a bit trickier. Let me teach you want I learned.
The basics But first, let’s summarize the basics. I have a server with a hosting provider that I want to use as a VPN server. I won’t delve into details here, since there are so many great explanations on the web already (here, here, here or here), let’s just make a quick summary of a simple setup, as a base for discussing the (slightly) more advanced usages I had to configure myself:</description>

      <description>Date: March 7, 2111
Abstract
This document defines the syntax and semantics of the Do-Not-Stab header, a proposed HTTP header
that allows users to indicate to a website their preferences about being stabbed. It also provides
a standard for how services should comply with such user preferences, if they wish to.
