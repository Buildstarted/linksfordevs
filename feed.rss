My home DNS server decided it didn&amp;#39;t want to resolve things any more, and it took far too long to figure out why.

      <title>Self-serve feature platforms: architectures and APIs</title>
      <link>https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/08/self-serve-feature-platforms.html</link>
      <description>The last few years saw the maturation of a core component of the MLOps stack: feature platforms. A feature platform handles feature engineering, feature computation, and serving computed features for models to use to generate predictions. Many companies -- Airbnb, LinkedIn, Snap, Meta, etc. -- have publicly discussed the architecture and use cases of their feature platforms. The first part discusses the evolution of feature platforms, how they differ from model platforms and feature stores. The second part discusses the core challenges of making feature platforms self-serve for data scientists and increase the iteration speed for feature engineering.</description>

      <title>Consciousness and Materialism | Luke&amp;#39;s Webpage</title>
      <link>https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/consciousness-and-materialism/</link>
      <description>Hume’s Parallel David Hume has often been quoted for his “Is” vs. “Ought” distinction. The argument is that fact and morality are two different domains, and from no accumulation of statements of fact alone can we ever jump to a statement of morality.
We can say statements of fact such as:
To be murdered is potentially painful. To be murdered is irreversible. Murder causes social dysfunction. Etc. … By merely my collecting these, we haven’t proven that Murder is evil.</description>

      <description>... if you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you&amp;#39;re screwed anyway, and should fix your program.
This is written in the Linux style guide. Let&amp;#39;s see why they have that rule and how we can overcome deeply nested code.
