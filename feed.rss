      <description>Nowadays, you don&amp;#39;t have to be bored anymore. In the queue at the checkout, you pull out your mobile to read the latest football news, and during a long, boring car ride, you listen to a podcast. That&amp;#39;s a pity because by boring yourself to death, you come to insights and ideas that you wouldn&amp;#39;t have otherwise.</description>

      <title>licenserecon – Simon Josefsson&amp;#39;s blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.josefsson.org/2023/12/29/validating-debian-copyright-licenserecon/</link>
      <description>Recently I noticed a new tool called licenserecon written by Peter Blackman, and I helped get licenserecon into Debian.  The purpose of licenserecon is to reconcile licenses from debian/copyright against the output from licensecheck, a tool written by Jonas Smedegaard.  It assumes DEP5 copyright files.  You run the tool in a directory that has a debian/ sub-directory, and its output when it notices mismatches (this is for resolv-wrapper):</description>

      <title>How not to suck at Supercharging</title>
      <link>https://blog.forret.com/2023/12/28/tesla-supercharger/</link>
      <description>A recent trip to the U.K. showed me the reality of opening the Supercharger network to non-Tesla cars. I hadn’t really seen much of that in Belgium yet, but then I don’t use the Superchargers a lot when I’m close to home. The occupation rate of the stations I tried in the U.K. was higher than before (2021-2022), with anywhere from 25% to 75% of the stalls occupied by other brands. And that is not without its challenges.</description>

      <title>Rabbithole: A weird CPIO discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://blog.colindou.ch/posts/lets-make-an-os-cpio-weirdness/</link>
      <description>We learnt previously that an initramfs in Linux is a “CPIO archive”, so I set out to write something that can read and write them, in order to learn more about the format. What I found was an interesting discrepancy between how GNU cpio and the Linux Kernel parse CPIO files. It seems pretty innocuous, but I thought I’d document it for posterity.
The CPIO header CPIO is an exceedingly simple format.</description>

      <description>I got a few dozen people asking me how Bloom was built. I never had the opportunity to really give a comprehensive answer to that question. Since I ran that business for nearly 3 years and have completed my time, I had some time to reflect and distill the experience below in writing (as a 3 part series) in small hopes that it may encourage someone to start building out there!</description>

      <title>Creating Christmas UI in .NET MAUI</title>
      <link>https://askxammy.com/creating-christmas-ui-in-net-maui/</link>
      <description>Merry Christmas! &amp;#127876; I hope you&amp;#39;re doing well during this season and enjoying time with your loved ones! &amp;#128147; As we wrap up the year, let&amp;#39;s continue improving our XAML skills by replicating a Christmas-themed user interface (UI). You&amp;#39;ll see how you can create impressive results with simple steps! This UI is based on a design sourced from Dribbble!

Explanation Insights
&amp;#128466; Before diving in, here are some guidelines to enhance your experience while replicating the UI:
▪ Reference Image: Initially, you’ll encounter an image displaying the original UI. This image is segmented into blocks, mirroring how we’ll approach each design element.
▪ Design Blocks: Every block features a specific design element we’ll focus on. These elements are accentuated within a highlighted box.
▪ Code Annotations: Within the coding sections, lookout for comments stating, “Insert the following code here.” These comments signal that the upcoming code explanation corresponds directly to that marked location.

Let’s start!
Breaking Down the Original Design into Blocks
For clarity and a structured approach, I’ve segmented the original design into specific blocks. We’ll tackle each block in the sequence presented below:




Main structure
In this case, we want to keep the same colors for both light and dark mode, let&amp;#39;s start by adding a white background color to the ContentPage.

⚠️ Additionally, if you&amp;#39;re interested in learning how to adapt your applications for both light and dark modes, I highly recommend the article Handling Light and Dark Mode With .NET MAUI .
To organize the UI elements we will use the VerticalStackLayout as the main layout:

If you want to know more information about VerticalStackLayout, I invite you to read the article Horizontal &amp;amp; VerticalStackLayout in .NET MAUI.






&amp;#160;

Let&amp;#39;s start by adding the main block:
➖ Santa Claus&amp;#39;s picture:
Our main block contains the image of Santa Claus. To adapt the appearance of the image, we will use the Aspect property adding &amp;#39;Fill&amp;#39; as a value. This property can be very useful for adjusting the appearance of your images. I encourage you to explore the different results it can offer.
For more information, please refer to the provided article Image Scaling in .NET MAUI.


&amp;#160;



As you can see, this user interface is incredibly simple and quick to create! Now, we have reached our final block, which is made up of three elements. We will explore every detail below:


➖&amp;#160;Main description:
