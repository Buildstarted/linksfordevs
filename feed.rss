      <description>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has become the greatest global public health crisis in a century. Experts say a vaccine is our best hope for ending the pandemic, but a commercial vaccine won’t arrive until late 2020 or early 2021, if all goes well.</description>

      <title>Alcohol as a social technology to check the trustworthiness of
others</title>
      <link>https://hndex.org/7798063</link>
      <description>Ohhh, never thought of this hypothesis: that the act of getting
drunk together might be a social technology that helps us verify
the trustworthiness of others by inhibiting their higher cognitive
functions and thus making it harder to consciously fake things.
That would make sense.</description>

      <title>Automate everything that is not part of the problem you’re solving</title>
      <link>https://blog.frederikring.com/articles/automate-whats-not-part-of-the-problem/</link>
      <description>When faced with the decision if something is worth automating or not, the default reaction for most developers and product managers will be simple: estimating the time spent on a manual task, and comparing it with the time it would take to automate the task away. Whatever takes the least time wins. When building Offen, the decision of what to automate came up quite a few times as well, and I have realized that only looking at time spent might be a bit short-sighted.</description>
