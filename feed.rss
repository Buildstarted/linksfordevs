      <description>A controversial GitHub issue came to my attention a couple of weeks ago around ditching the in-memory provider for Entity Framework Core.

      <description>Since the first browser war between Netscape and Internet Explorer, web browsers have been using features as their primary means of competing with each other. This strategy of unlimited scope and perpetual feature creep is reckless, and has been allowed to go on for far too long.</description>

      <description>JetBrains Rider, The cross-platform .NET IDE from JetBrains, has been my defacto .NET development environment for over a year now (maybe even two). Having the same tool across macOS and Windows environments is a joy, and with every iteration, the team at JetBrains puts out, the product gets better. I want to show you a feature I recently discovered working on my Hypermedia Lite post (I suggest you check it out if you’re an ASP.NET Core developer).</description>

      <title>How Prince of Persia Defeated Apple II's Memory Limitations | War Stories | Ars Technica</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw0VfmXKq54</link>
      <description>For today’s episode of War Stories, Ars Technica sat down with Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner to learn about the challenges he faced while bringing his ambitious vision for the game to life. As the 1980's wound down, Mechner found himself fighting against not only the limitations of the Apple II hardware but the impending death of the platform itself. Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.
