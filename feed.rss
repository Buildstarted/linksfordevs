      <description>A couple of weeks back, I wrote a post about some of the work that USAID did.&amp;#160; Now I’d like to drill down a bit and talk about some of the work that I personally did for USAID.</description>

      <description>A choice isn’t just about where it takes you immediately. It&amp;#39;s about the choices you get to make thereafter. The best choice is usually the one that opens the greatest number of promising branches (not just the one tied to a single, seemingly perfect outcome).</description>

      <title>Four Years of Jai</title>
      <link>https://smarimccarthy.is/posts/2024-12-02-four-years-of-jai/</link>
      <description>I’ve been programming for long enough to be righteously cantankerous about a lot of things. The list of languages, frameworks and libraries I’ve worked with professionally or on personal projects is too long to list – but it includes everything from C and assembly languages through C++, Pascal and Delphi, through Java and Clojure, through Perl, PHP, Python, Javascript, Typescript and so on. I’ve tinkered with Rust, APL, Uiua, Erlang and Haskell.</description>

      <title>The ESP32 &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot; that wasn&amp;#39;t | Dark Mentor LLC</title>
      <link>https://darkmentor.com/blog/esp32_non-backdoor/</link>
      <description>This post refutes the claim that researchers found a &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot; in ESP32 Bluetooth chips. What the researchers highlight (vendor-specific HCI commands to read &amp;amp; write controller memory) is a common design pattern found in other Bluetooth chips from other vendors as well, such as Broadcom, Cypress, and Texas Instruments. Vendor-specific commands in Bluetooth effectively constitute a &amp;quot;private API&amp;quot;, and a company&amp;#39;s choice to not publicly document their private API does not constitute a &amp;quot;backdoor&amp;quot;.</description>

      <title>Par Part 3: Par, Continued</title>
      <link>https://ryanbrewer.dev/posts/par/</link>
      <description>Par is notoriously difficult to understand, but mostly due to a lack of resources. This post hopes to build on the prior posts on sequent calculus and linear logic to show how par is not such an alien concept after all, and make the theory much more accessible. We&amp;#39;ll naturally stumble into constructive/computational classical logic along the way!</description>

      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/binary-search-isn-t-about-search-ii-loop-invariant-of-leftmost-element-search/</link>
      <description>In the first “Binary search isn’t about search” post, we spoke about using assert statements to enforce your loop invariants. Our plain old everyday binary search invariant can be summarized as such:
For all x in L[0:l]1, x is strictly less than T, the element we are searching for. For all y in L[r:len(L)]2, y is strictly greater than T, the element we are searching for. Or, if we want to be even terser, we could note this as simply</description>
