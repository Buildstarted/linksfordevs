      <title>FSE Meets the FBI! — FSE Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.freespeechextremist.com/blog/fse-vs-fbi.html</link>
      <description>I have for you a bizarre tale of scrapers, feds, data poisoning, Torswats, and everyone's favorite fedi instance.  It veers technical, because I suspect it will be of interest to other people running servers with UGC (i.e., every fedi instance), and also because the mechanics of how I figured out what I figured out might be useful.  It's also got information about how the FBI collects data, which is of interest to everyone, but especially US citizens.  I have a few pieces of the puzzle, maybe someone with interlocking pieces can say more; I'm happy to compare notes.</description>

      <title>SonicDoor – Cracking SonicWall’s SMA 500 – SCRT Team Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.scrt.ch/2025/06/04/sonicdoor-attacking-sonicwalls-sma-500/</link>
      <description>While attempting to compare the security level of various VPN vendors, I kept falling down the path of searching for vulnerabilities instead. This blog post details the ones I discovered in SonicWall’s SMA 500, which were patched in December 2024. This post has been delayed to coincide with my talk at SecurityFest on this exact subject.</description>

      <title>Getting started with QT, without the nonsense</title>
      <link>https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-04-04-qt-minimal/</link>
      <description>At work I have recently (yesterday) ended working on a big project and
I am now waiting for a new assignment. While I wait, I decided that I
should take some time to learn something that could be useful both at
work and for my personal projects.  After some thought, I settled on QT
development with C++.</description>

      <title>When the Assistant Becomes the Attacker: Hidden Risks of Tool-Enabled LLMs</title>
      <link>https://www.sakana.fr/blog/2025-06-08-llm-hidden-risks/</link>
      <description>LLMs aren’t just chatbots anymore. Once you give them tools, they stop suggesting and start acting. This piece explores the real—and often overlooked—risks of giving LLMs the ability to affect the world.</description>

      <title>No JS, No BS Ethical Web Analytics — Andrew Tropin</title>
      <link>https://trop.in/blog/no-js-no-bs-ethical-web-analytics</link>
      <description>I had two goals: to count AI crawlers DDoSing my nginx
infrastructure and to see if anybody reads at least one of my
three posts in the blog.  To achieve both, I needed to gather
data and transform it into meaningful insights, so basically I needed
web analytics.</description>

      <title>Focus and Context and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://taras.glek.net/posts/focus-and-context-and-llms/</link>
      <description>I decided to write down some thoughts on agentic coding and why it’s a very hyped wrong turn.
Let me start with some background on my LLM experience. I adopted LLMs into my work in Aug 2020. I was sold when I saw that GPT-3 could generate usable SQL statements. Something that used to take 4-8 hours of RTFMing, now took 15min. I have since worked on chatcraft.org, various RAG frameworks, etc. I use aider heavily for work, frequently switch models, have been struggling with tool calling during dark ages before MCP.</description>

      <title>Ditching HAProxy (in my homelab)</title>
      <link>https://arch.dog/bark/ditching-haproxy</link>
      <description>I'm always bothered by single points of failure. For my homelab, this quickly became a single HAProxy virtual machine. It existed on only one of my Proxmox instances (I can't replicate between them because the original instance doesn't use zfs. oops) so if the virtual machine or physical machine was unreachable for whatever reason, it effectively blocked my access to any service in my homelab Kubernetes cluster, and also broke communication between nodes and the Kubernetes API. It didn't happen often, and the fix was often trivial, but it still bothered me. Coupled with the fact that until recently the Kubernetes cluster also acted as a reverse proxy to services hosted on Proxmox and my NAS (read more about that stuff here), it could cause a wider outage than just what's on the cluster.</description>
