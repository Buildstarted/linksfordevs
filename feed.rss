      <title>Building a fully local LLM voice assistant to control my smart home</title>
      <link>https://johnthenerd.com/blog/local-llm-assistant/</link>
      <description>I’ve had my days with Siri and Google Assistant. While they have the ability to control your devices, they cannot be customized and inherently rely on cloud services. In hopes of learning something new and having something cool I could use in my life, I decided I want better.
The premises are simple:
I want my new assistant to be sassy and sarcastic.
I want everything running local. No exceptions. There is no reason for my coffee machine downstairs to talk to a server on the other side of the country.</description>

      <description>(This is, I think, a silly idea. But sometimes the silliest things lead to unexpected results.) The text of Shakespeare&amp;#39;s Romeo and Juliet is about 146,000 characters long. Thanks to the English language, each character can be represented by a single byte. So a plain Unicode text file of the play is about 142KB. In [...]</description>

      <title>A Cloudflare Workers primer: hello world</title>
      <link>https://xenodium.com/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/</link>
      <description>The vast majority of my software development experience has been centered around client-side software. The few times I&amp;#39;ve needed a server-side component for a hobby project, I&amp;#39;ve historically provisioned a linux virtual machine somewhere and ran whatever services I needed. I have to admit though, I don&amp;#39;t enjoy the provisioning process, configuration, maintenance, upgrades, database admin, etc. which take time away from the part I enjoy more: building and experimenting with features.</description>

      <link>https://www.cryptologie.net/article/605/whats-out-there-for-ecdsa-threshold-signatures/</link>
      <description>In the realm of multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, threshold signing is the protocol that address how multiple participants can sign something under a &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot; private key. In other words, instead of one guy signing something with a private key, we want $N$ guys doing the same thing and obtaining the same result without any of them actually knowing the private key (each of them holds a share ...</description>

      <description>Recently I had a phone interview where I got asked a variety of Java questions. This kind of thing is standard, and most of the questions were somewhat standard:

 * What is polymorphism?
 * What’s the difference between a List and a Set? When would you use one over the other?</description>
