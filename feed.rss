      <title>Simplify DisplayName Calls In Razor Views</title>
      <link>https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/simplify-displayname-calls-in-razor</link>
      <description>Razor is a sharp user interface language, but it can also cut into our sensibilities and aesthetic code choices. ASP.NET ships with many HTML helpers to help reduce the amount of code we write to ship user interfaces, and for the most part, they work pretty well. With the latest version of ASP.NET, there are techniques we can use to reduce the noise in our views.</description>

      <description>In Part 2, we used Visual Studio's Publish feature to deploy our NServiceBus endpoint to an Azure App Service, and after only one manual change in the Azure Portal, saw our endpoint successfully running by viewing the app service logs.
