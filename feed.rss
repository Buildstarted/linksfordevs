      <title>The best way to have complex discussions — CQ2</title>
      <link>https://cq2.co/blog/the-best-way-to-have-complex-discussions</link>
      <description>We love complex, deep discussions. We&amp;#39;ve seen or been part of many discussions — strategic discussions at work, discussions on AI alignment, on technical design documents, etc. For us, the most frustrating issues with complex discussions are (1) impulsive responses and (2) lack of structure.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models, Open API, View Models and the Backend for Frontend Pattern | johnnyreilly</title>
      <link>https://johnnyreilly.com/large-language-models-view-models-backend-for-frontend</link>
      <description>To integrate LLMs with APIs, there is a need for the LLM equivalent of view models and the backend for frontend pattern. This discusses it in the context of Semantic Kernel.</description>

      <link>https://mantisek.com/wireguard-tutorial-11720202048</link>
      <description>Wireguard is a fast, straightforward, secure, and incredibly easy to set up VPN that aims to be faster than other common VPNs (like OpenVPN and Ipsec) by living inside the linux kernel and using much faster cryptographic primitives.  While Wireguard is available for Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS and Android, you still need a linux kernel to benefit from the extra speed. While still in development, it’s already faster than OpenVPN.  Wireguard is also different from other VPNs by not utilizing a typically ‘client/server’ relationship, opting instead for peers.  Any client can be a server, and any server can be a client, and the setup is almost identical for both.

Wireguard uses the GPLv2 license, and even has a positive comment about its code from Linus Torvalds:</description>

      <title>The Vary HTTP header</title>
      <link>https://blog.frankel.ch/vary-http-header/</link>
      <description>I try to constantly deepen my knowledge of HTTP and REST. Recently, I stumbled upon the list of all registered HTTP Headers. This post is dedicated to the Vary HTTP Header.   The problem   Two years ago, I wrote about web resource caching server-side. The idea is to set up a component between the client and the upstream to cache previously computed results to avoid overloading the latter. Depending on your infrastructure and requirements, this component can be a reverse proxy or an API Gateway. H</description>

      <title>I made a note taking plugin for an app written in PHP :: Show me the code — Software engineering is cool</title>
      <link>https://showmethecode.io/posts/notes-plugin-release/</link>
      <description>TL;DR I wanted to do more with plugin development because I&amp;amp;rsquo;m interested in implementing plugin architectures. Here&amp;amp;rsquo;s the repo for the notes plugin, and here&amp;amp;rsquo;s the page for Kanboard&amp;amp;rsquo;s plugin registry.
Why would you make yet another note taking app?  I wanted to learn the ins and outs of Kanboard, my task tracking app of choice that I self host in my homelab. I wanted to get into writing plugins for things so I could show how useful and awesome plugins are.</description>

      <title>Backend Engineer tries to build a hardware counter for its side project.</title>
      <link>https://simonedutto.github.io/2024-05-05/hardware-counter</link>
      <description>I am building a game called Binary Duel, and since we are committed to staying as simple as possible we don’t have a nice admin panel with all fancy stats. So, in an urge to build something in C (ty for the psyops to all HN), I decided to build a cute little box to show the number of games currently being played! Here I briefly describe the project. The Result Here is the counter in all its glory. My decoupage skills are as good as it gets, sue me (don’t). The process For the impatient here is the code: Github repo Hardware Components Node MCU Amica (ESP8266): similar to Arduino but with Wifi Module, smaller and cheaper 7-digit display 3x 660Ω resistor a bunch of jumper wires old metal box hopes Wiring We tend to love to copy others when doing something, however I would not copy the wiring of a backend engineer! However, here is the photo if you are interested. After making sure everything work is time to use a smaller board and a lot of tape to crawl of this mess inside the box (very painful). Software The code is fairly simple, we just need to: create an API in our service to expose the number of games being played fetch this number update the counter However, there are things that we take for granted, that are not in a microcontroller development environment: Debugging with my setup at least, it is not possible to debug the code, and for some reason, the serial output was not showing correctly with all the pins connected. So I trusted the process and used the 7digits display to show HTTP status codes or errors. Sending an HTTP request and parsing the JSON Even with using the libraries, this is the code to perform and HTTP request and parsing the response. int httpGETRequest(const char* serverName) { &amp;#160; std::unique_ptr&amp;lt;BearSSL::WiFiClientSecure&amp;gt;client(new BearSSL::WiFiClientSecure); &amp;#160; client-&amp;gt;setInsecure(); &amp;#160; HTTPClient https; &amp;#160; String payload = &amp;quot;{}&amp;quot;; &amp;#160; if (https.begin(*client, serverName)) { &amp;#160; &amp;#160; https.setAuthorization(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;password&amp;quot;); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; int httpCode = https.GET(); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; if (httpCode &amp;gt; 0) { &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; if (httpCode == HTTP_CODE_OK || httpCode == HTTP_CODE_MOVED_PERMANENTLY) { &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; payload = https.getString(); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; Serial.println(payload); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; https.end(); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; JSONVar myObject = JSON.parse(payload); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; if (JSON.typeof(myObject) == &amp;quot;undefined&amp;quot;) { &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; return 999; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; } &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; return int(myObject[&amp;quot;num_games&amp;quot;]); &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; } &amp;#160; &amp;#160; } &amp;#160; &amp;#160; return httpCode; &amp;#160; } &amp;#160; return -1; } HTTP-S We take for granted to have certificates in all of our machines that just work without setting them up. &amp;#160; In a board, you don’t have any certificate authority, so you need to either import them or client-&amp;gt;setInsecure(); It is not good to disable SSL verification in general, so be careful. Laws of physic Usually, when a backend engineer pulls up laws of physics, it is time to pack it up and go. However, the first time I finished this box, everything was working, so I decided to close the lid. All of a sudden nothing was working anymore. Can you guess why? I guess I built a Faraday Cage. So the Wi-Fi signal was not able to reach my board anymore. After poking some holes in the lid, everything was working smoothly again.</description>

      <description>Having fun with fonts doesn’t always mean obsessing over kerning and ligatures. Sometimes, writing text is not even the point!
You don’t believe it? Type something in here.
Characters to generate: Generate! Teranoptia is a cool font that lets you build small creatures by mapping each letter (and a few other characters) to a piece of a creature like a head, a tail, a leg, a wing and so on.</description>
