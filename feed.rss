      <title>The Guilty, Crazy Secret That Helps Me Write - RyanHoliday.net</title>
      <link>https://ryanholiday.net/the-guilty-crazy-secret-that-helps-me-write/</link>
      <description>GEORGE: I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it in front of clients. It’s taking over my life. JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that. He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized. GEORGE: Really? What if it doesn’t stop? JERRY gestures “That’s the breaks.” – Seinfeld “The Jacket” I won’t say that I present the picture of mental health or anything, but most people would be surprised to find out I harbor a habit that hints at deep insanity. I listen to the same song over and over again. Alone in my office, or on my iPod, or on my phone, I play them on repeat over and over and over again. Loudly. In my iTunes library there are&amp;#160;certain songs of an embarrassing nature&amp;#160;that I have played more than 300 or 400 times in a row (that is a full 24 hours each). I’ve gone through so many computers over the last few years that I don’t have an accurate tally, but if I were to add them up, the numbers and the songs would seem preposterous, even to me. They are my version of the backyard shed, covered in incomprehensible gibberish in&amp;#160;A Beautiful Mind, or the wall in&amp;#160;Carrie Mathison’s&amp;#160;apartment after a manic fit. And then I wake from my stupor and discard the songs like used condoms and pretend it never happened. As a result, I no longer enjoy “music,” a fact that the 16-year-old version of myself–the one who was in a band and had hard drives full of rare music–would have found unthinkable. God knows, I never thought I’d find myself 142 listens in on a Taylor Swift song on a Tuesday morning. But there is a method to the madness. I found that this secret habit has been the fuel for&amp;#160;my creative output. See,&amp;#160;part of writing–or really any creative endeavor from brainstorming to marketing–requires tuning everything out. There are a couple ways to do this. You have your noise canceling headphones or ambient noise machines. You can put your phone on “Airplane Mode” or tell everyone to leave you alone. The problem with these reductive techniques is that they leave everything a little empty. In my experience, it’s not about quiet, it’s about finding your zone. I think melodic music, played on repeat, puts you in a heightened emotional state–while simultaneously dulling your awareness to most of your surroundings. It puts you in a creative zone. The important facilities are turned on, while all the others are turned off. Sometimes “good” songs can help you with that. But Bruce Springsteen only has so many songs that work for this (Try “I’m On Fire”). You exhaust them soon enough and have to start listening to songs on the Top 40. And you stop caring who wrote them–as long as it brings you closer to that state. Michael Lewis (Liar’s Poker, The Blind Side, The Big Short)&amp;#160;has spoken about this too. Writing a book–or really any major creative project–puts you in an “agitated mental state.” It’s hard to sleep, it’s hard to concentrate, it’s hard to be present in everyday. But you can’t afford that when you’re&amp;#160;actually working. He fixes that by&amp;#160;doing the following: I pull down the blinds. I put my headset on and play the same soundtrack of twenty songs over and over and I don’t hear them. It shuts everything else out. So I don’t hear myself as I’m writing and laughing and talking to myself. I’m not even aware I’m making noise. I’m having a physical reaction to a very engaging experience. It is not a detached process. You might ask, can you accomplish this by listening to music like a normal person? I would have thought so too, but the answer is no. Repeat on the same song or the same two or three songs allows the songs to fade into themselves–to become a more or less a continuous stream. The reason I gravitate towards radio singles is that they normally have big, catchy choruses. The idea is that after enough listens to song becomes a perpetual chorus. Time stops. Distractions stop. Extraneous thinking stops. (Proof of which is the fact that you’re not bothered by the fact that the song is looping every three minutes and thirty seconds.) All that’s left is the work at hand. All that’s left is that little voice inside your head that you’re attempting to hear and translate onto the page. All that’s left is&amp;#160;the book or the paper you’re reading. All that’s left is problem you’re trying to crack when you go for a walk. All that’s left is the workout you’re trying to complete. The bullshit–well, it disappears for a fleeting second. Creative work isn’t about pleasure. It’s not always fun. It’s about reaching something inside yourself–something that society and everyday life make extraordinarily difficult. This is one way to do it. The fact that it basically ruined music for me is a cost I am willing to pay. I’ll take my fix from anyone–and I’m not ashamed to say that I have. Even if that means I have to listen to the Black Eyed Peas or some other god-awful group. Every writer (or painter or thinker or adman) finds their own way. This is mine. Maybe it will work for you. Or maybe you’ll try it and never look at me the same way again. The post originally ran on ThoughtCatalog.com. Comments can be seen there.

      <title>willfennel.com – Learning on the fly, impostor syndrome, and Vim dumbassery</title>
      <link>https://willfennel.com/posts/2021/05/29/learning-impostor-syndrome-and-vim-dumbassery.html</link>
      <description>One of the things I love about working in IT is that you can often learn on the go. It’s possible to learn something so quickly during the job, that you can come in with no experience at all, and become productive enough to add value to a project in a small timeframe.</description>

      <title>The Feynman Lectures on Physics Audio Collection</title>
      <link>https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/flptapes.html</link>
      <description>These are the tape recordings of Richard Feynman&amp;#39;s 1961-64 Caltech Introductory Physics lectures, which form the basis of the book The Feynman Lectures on Physics. The original recordings were made on 1/4&amp;quot; reel-to-reel tapes, now preserved in Caltech&amp;#39;s Archive. In 2010 the entire collection was digitized by media preservationist George Blood, at a sampling rate of 96 kHz with 24-bit samples, PCM-encoded in tiff files about 2 GB each in size. For this online publication we are serving more compact versions, downsampled to 48 kHz with 16-bit samples, reencoded as AAC-HE (mp4) and Opus (ogg) at a data rate of 48 kbps.</description>
