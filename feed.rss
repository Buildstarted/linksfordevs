      <title>Historical programming-language groups disappearing from Google</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/827233/</link>
      <description>As Alex McDonald notes in this
support request, Google has recently banned the old Usenet groups
comp.lang.forth and comp.lang.lisp from the Google Groups system.
"Of specific concern is the archive. These are some of the oldest
groups on Usenet, and the depth &amp; breadth of the historical material that
has just disappeared from the internet, on two seminal programming
languages, is huge and highly damaging. These are the history and
collective memories of two communities that are being expunged, and it's
not great, since there is no other comprehensive archive after Google's
purchase of Dejanews around 20 years ago."
Perhaps Google can be convinced to restore the content, but it also seems
that some of this material could benefit from a more stable archive.</description>

      <title>Expanding Beyond 64kb of Memory with Bank Switching (16-Bit VM in JavaScript 012)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=araYkE3KAms</link>
      <description>In this episode we're learning about memory bank switching - a technique common in the retro game console days - that allows us to address more memory than the limited address space that 16 bits provides!

=[ ‚Ñπ About ‚Ñπ ]=


This series is all about building a powerful virtual machine in JavaScript with the following features:

- A flexible, extensible, register-based virtual machine
- Support for signed, unsigned and floating point operations
- A call stack 
- Interrupt capabilities
- Ability to do memory mapping for IO
- An assembly language with macro and module support
- A higher level, C like language. We'll use and expand the library from the parser combinators from scratch series
- And finally, to be able to take the whole thing into the browser and extend it to create a sort of fantasy console - an emulator for a machine that never existed

      <title>Migrating a 40TB SQL Server Database</title>
      <link>https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/</link>
      <description>Initially, I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked if people would be interested, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place (I‚Äôll explain that later).</description>

      <title>The falsehoods of anti-AGPL propaganda</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/07/27/Anti-AGPL-propaganda.html</link>
      <description>Google is well-known for forbidding the use of software using the GNU Affero General Public License, commonly known as ‚ÄúAGPL‚Äù. Google is also well-known for being the subject of cargo-culting by fad startups. Unfortunately, this means that they are susceptible to what is ultimately anti-AGPL propaganda from Google, with little to no basis in fact.</description>

      <description>(Live thread, will be updated with new visuals and polish over the next few days)

A trained language model generates text.

We can optionally pass it some text as input, which influences its output.

The output is generated from what the model ‚Äúlearned‚Äù during its training period where it scanned vast amounts of text.

      <title>Wrappers</title>
      <link>https://www.tclauson.com/2020/07/27/Wrappers.html</link>
      <description>SaaS businesses (particularly ones for technical users) sometimes have to deal with a vocal outcry that their product ‚Äúis just a wrapper around‚Äù something. The implication is that ‚Äòa wrapper‚Äô is inherently not valuable, and it‚Äôs impossible to build a great business around such a product. This logic is a product of lazy thinking and myopia; ‚Äòwrappers‚Äô can be insanely valuable. Here are a few examples that come to mind: Dropbox is ‚Äújust rsync‚Äù Heroku is ‚Äújust Linux containers on AWS‚Äù Netlify is ‚Äújust static hosting and a CDN‚Äù Retool is ‚Äújust MS Access reinvented for the web‚Äù IFTTT is ‚Äújust cron + APIs‚Äù These statements are lazy thinking‚Äìthey have elements of truth in them, but they aren‚Äôt complete. People are willing to pay for magic. This magic sometimes goes by names like ‚Äúit just works‚Äù or ‚Äúconsumerized experience.‚Äù The thread that runs through the different monikers is that it accomplishes an otherwise painful1 task quickly and delights the user. Technical users want to be delighted, too, even if the interaction layer may not be a GUI. It might be a CLI, fantastic docs, or a clean API (or likely all of the above). So, if you can take something painful and move the interaction layer, the value proposition of the underlying tools grows. Big cloud providers will likely offer a comparable service, but these aren‚Äôt often existential threats to the best-in-class original. Why? Because the interaction layer matters and a meaningful subset of users are willing to pay for the premium experience. A few condensed observations about this ‚Äòinteraction layer‚Äô: people want a ‚Äòsensible defaults‚Äô way of doing things ‚Ä¶ an opinionated way of starting out UI/UX matters a lot (this includes docs and CLI) rarely, the core value prop isn‚Äôt already being accomplished crudely by huge companies modern open-source companies that are successful have to nail this in ways their predecessors didn‚Äôt2 consumerization of everything ‚Äî i.e., how little of $PLUMBING can I get away with knowing? there are a meaningful number of technical users who can do something, but don‚Äôt want to waste otherwise valuable time doing so One could argue that the term for this is just ‚Äòuser experience,‚Äô but that doesn‚Äôt seem quite right to me. Because it‚Äôs not about an experience of the underlying tool or process, it‚Äôs about creating an entirely new tool by ‚Äòwrapping‚Äô some of the original components. pain usually equates to a measure of complexity, monotony, or slowness¬†‚Ü© I suspect this is because we now have such a good base of open-source software that much of the opportunity is with higher-level products. Decades ago, the popular OSS products were things like operating systems, programming languages, and language-adjacent tools like compilers. Then, higher-level abstractions started moving open-source: webservers, web frameworks, e-commerce platforms, content management systems. The trendline is higher, and the interaction layer matters more the higher you go¬†‚Ü©</description>

efficiently flip bits and push pixels.

But... people aren't. Behind every piece of software, there's at least one
human. Who has a heart, and who cares what you think. Who has hopes, and dreams,
and fears. Who feels.
