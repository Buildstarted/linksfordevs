      <title>Using Phoenix Without Webpack</title>
      <link>https://jsonmaur.com/using-phoenix-without-webpack/</link>
      <description>Gravitating away from Javascript over the years, I’ve been exposed to many different programming paradigms and languages. One in particular is functional programming with Elixir, and building web apps with the Phoenix framework. Not only is Elixir a clean and well-designed language, Phoenix takes an HTML-over-the-wire approach similar to traditional frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails, which I prefer over the client-side SPA/server-side API approach. Phoenix also has an amazing community behind it and doesn’t make you feel like pulling your hair out at 3am over cryptic build issues (unlike a popular JS framework that shall remain nameless).</description>

      <description>Way back in the halcyon days of September 2010, I threw my hat in the ring for the first Ludum Dare October Challenge, where a bunch of hobbyist gamedevs built indie games in public, for a month, with the end
 goal of getting them out for sale before the end of October. The idea was to turn a bunch of hobbyists (i.e., us) into professionals (i.e., what we wanted to be) -- and if the definition of a &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;someone who gets paid for their work&amp;quot;, well, 
all we had to do was make a game, release it, and earn at least $1 from it.</description>

After several successes with tech startups and running his own software company, he joined Microsoft to follow his passion for crafting tools that help developers create better app experiences. When he’s not at a computer or with his family, he’s running trails through the woods. &amp;amp;nbsp; David takes listeners through the ins and outs of multi-platform app development using .NET MAUI in today’s episode. He shares what developers can look forward to come the November release and provides a full rundown of what it looks like to use .NET MAUI from wrapping the local environment and building to testing to packaging and deploying.
