      <title>Update: youtube-dl reinstantiated thanks to EFF</title>
      <link>https://assassinate-you.net/posts/2020/11/youtube-dl-update/</link>
      <description>In October, the popular and famous archivist tool youtube-dl was taken down by GitHub due to a DMCA request by the Recording Industry Association of America. I posted a detailed analysis explaining the relation between international, US, EU and German law, and showing why this request was very different from what most people know as the “classic” DMCA takedown request. I felt this was necessary since there were a lot of rumor and wrong claims out on the Internet (not just in forums or on the (anti)social media, but also on media offerings), which did not help the discussion at all. The repository is back now, thanks to the EFF and its team. They filed a counter-notice on behalf of the youtube-dl maintainers, which allowed GitHub to reinstantiate the repository.</description>

      <title>I tried creating a web browser, and Google blocked me</title>
      <link>https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/google-widevine-blocked-my-browser/</link>
      <description>After 4 months of waiting, that is the response I got from Widevine, Google’s DRM for web browsers, regarding a license agreement. For the last 2 years I’ve been working on a web browser that now cannot be completed because Google, the creators of the open source browser Chrome, won’t allow DRM in an open source project.
The browser I’m building, called Metastream, is an Electron-based (Chromium derived), MIT-licensed browser hosted on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch does not belong to Elastic</title>
      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/19/Elasticsearch-does-not-belong-to-Elastic.html</link>
      <description>Elasticsearch belongs to its 1,573 contributors, who retain their copyright, and
granted Elastic a license to distribute their work without restriction. This is
the loophole which Elastic exploited when they decided that Elasticsearch would
no longer be open source, a
loophole that they introduced with this very intention from the start. When you
read their announcement, don’t be gaslit by their deceptive language: Elastic is
no longer open source, and this is a move against open source. It is not
“doubling down on open”. Elastic has spit in the face of every single one of
1,573 contributors, and everyone who gave Elastic their trust, loyalty, and
patronage. This is an Oracle-level move.</description>

      <description>I know a number of folks use The Great Suspender to automatically suspend
inactive browser tabs in Chrome. Apparently recent versions of this extension
have been taken over by a shady anonymous entity and is now
flagged by Microsoft as malware. Notably the most recent
version of the extension (v7.1.8) has added integrated analytics that can
track all of your browsing activity across all sites. Yikes.</description>

      <title>How do I disassociate a thread from an I/O completion port? | The Old New Thing</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210120-00/?p=104740</link>
      <description>A thread becomes associated with an I/O completion port when it calls Get&amp;#173;Queued&amp;#173;Completion&amp;#173;Status to retrieve a completion from that port. I/O completion ports keep track of the threads that are associated with them, because one of the rules for I/O completion ports is that the I/O completion port will not dispatch new work if the number of associated threads that are active (not blocked on anything) has reached the concurrency maximum.&amp;#185; But what if you want to dissociate a thread from an I/O completion port,</description>
