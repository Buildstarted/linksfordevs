      <title>Tip 356 - How to automatically scale Azure App Services</title>
      <link>https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip356.html</link>
      <description>Sometimes a lot of users visit your applications, and sometimes, it&amp;#39;s not busy. You want your application to stay up and running in both scenarios. The cloud offers elastic capabilities that make this possible. When a lot of users visit your application, you can automatically scale your application to meet those needs. And when it isn&amp;#39;t busy, your applications can scale back to minimize costs. Azure App Service Web Apps (opens new window) can do exactly that with autoscaling.</description>

      <title>Performance of Discriminated Unions and Active Patterns</title>
      <link>https://matthewcrews.com/blog/2022/03/performance-of-dus-and-active-patterns/</link>
      <description>Part of my work is writing algorithms to analyze networks of nodes representing manufacturing systems. Each node can be one of four different types: Buffer, Constraint, Merge, and Split. A manufacturing system that we would want to simulate is typically made up of no more than 100 of these nodes. A natural way to encode these types would be to use Discriminated Unions (DU). I also use Units of Measure to annotate integers that are the ids for these manufacturing nodes.</description>

      <title>The Tao of Acme</title>
      <link>https://benghancock.github.io/blog/2022/tao-of-acme.html</link>
      <description>Acme is a text editor originally developed for the Plan 9 operating
system in the 1990s by well-known software engineer Rob Pike, and has
since been ported to other Unix-like systems and platforms. It was
created to be a “user interface for
programmers,” and although it arguably belongs to a family of
“classic” text editors dating from an even earlier era — Emacs and vi —
it is distinguished by fundamentally different design decisions, user
experience, and overall look and feel.</description>

      <title>BAT: a Fast and Small Key Encapsulation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/02/14/bat-a-fast-and-small-key-encapsulation-mechanism/</link>
      <description>In this post we present a newly published key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) called BAT. It is a post-quantum algorithm, using NTRU lattices, and its main advantages are that it is both small and fast. The paper was accepted by TCHES (it should appear in volume 2022, issue 2) and is also available on ePrint: https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/031</description>
