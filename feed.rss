      <title>Did Schnorr destroy RSA? Show me the factors.</title>
      <link>https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0</link>
      <description>Schnorr has claimed new factoring methods that “destroy RSA”. This should be easy to demonstrate with well known challenges.</description>

      <title>RpiUno - BuiltWithDot.Net</title>
      <link>https://builtwithdot.net/project/349/rpiuno</link>
      <description>This is a Windows Runtime Component to enable Communication with Arduino in Windows 10 IoT Core UWPs.

Few years ago I built a Windows 10 IoT Core UWP for Hotel Automation. So, I thought why not make some of that available to others.

This was my first time writing a Windows runtime component. …</description>

      <description>Schnorr just released a new paper Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms with the words &amp;quot;This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem.&amp;quot; (spelling included) in the abstract.

What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there&amp;#39;s no conclusion in there.

      <title>Yet ANOTHER Machine Vise by TheGoofy</title>
      <link>https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2064269</link>
      <description>This is a quite robust 3d-printable machine vise. It&amp;#39;s 100% 3d-printed - no screw or other piece of hardware is needed to hold the individual pieces together. Pieces clip and snap together.
It&amp;#39;s a demonstration that it is very important to consider forces and material properties already when designing a mechanical object. Hints about proper design are presented in my video:
https://youtu.be/mziT7KV-fRI
The video also includes explanations how to assemble this vise.
For 3d-printing it&amp;#39;s recommended to print 3 shell layers. 35% infill is sufficient. All the forces for clamping a workpiece are only active at the outer surface - more infill doesn&amp;#39;t make the vise more robust. Layer height is 0.15 mm (maybe screws are better printed with 0.1mm layers). No support material needed. Printed with 0.4 mm nozzle.
Assembly: https://jig.space/view?jig=1216 (thanks to http://www.thingiverse.com/greenlig)
Designed with Fusion 360: http://a360.co/2juhSUG
If there are difficulties to print the threaded rods vertically, I&amp;#39;ve designed a version of the sliding jaw with horizontally printed rods: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2123529</description>

      <link>https://synack.me/ada/pico/2021/03/03/from-zero-to-blinky-ada.html</link>
      <description>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new RP2040 SoC on a $4 development board called Pico. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</description>

      <description>The &amp;quot;piracy is stealing&amp;quot; argument raises its head in the media every week and is on the lips of anti-piracy outfits and copyright holders every day. To them, every unauthorized copy is a lost sale and another small dent in the company spreadsheet which, when added to a million others, will destroy it bit by bit. To the maker of Minecraft, however, its an opportunity. Piracy is theft? You must be kidding. Lost sales? They don&amp;#39;t exist.</description>

      <title>PipeWire: The Linux audio/video bus</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/847412/d7826b1353e33734/</link>
      <description>For more than a decade, PulseAudio
has been serving the Linux desktop as its predominant audio
mixing and routing daemon — and its audio API. Unfortunately,
PulseAudio&amp;#39;s internal architecture does not fit the growing
sandboxed-applications use case, even though there have been attempts to amend that. PipeWire, a new daemon created (in part)
out of these attempts, will replace
PulseAudio in the upcoming Fedora 34 release. It is a coming
transition that deserves a look.</description>

      <description>Generics are great, until they aren&amp;#39;t, and when they aren&amp;#39;t is when you don&amp;#39;t know the type at compile-time but at runtime. This isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a bad thing, and isn&amp;#39;t necessarily a design problem. Remember, void Main is not generic, so at some point, your program needs to cross the</description>

That people get lost and confused about all this new syntax and feature added here and there. And while one may argue or not, I would like to look at this topic from a different angle – what are you missing in C#? What single functionality would you enjoy the most?</description>

      <link>https://hynek.me/articles/semver-will-not-save-you/</link>
      <description>The widely used Python package cryptography changed their build system to use Rust for low-level code which caused an emotional GitHub thread. Enthusiasts of 32-bit hardware from the 1990s aside, there was a vocal faction that stipulated adherence to Semantic Versioning from the maintainers – claiming it would’ve prevented all grief. I will show you not only why this is wrong, but also how relying on Semantic Versioning hurts you.</description>
