      <title>Why cancer cells waste so much energy</title>
      <link>https://news.mit.edu/2021/cancer-cells-waste-energy-0115</link>
      <description>MIT biologists have found a possible explanation for the Warburg effect, first seen in cancer cells in the 1920s. They found cancer cells use fermentation, an inefficient metabolic pathway, because it helps them to generate large quantities of a molecule called NAD+, which they need to synthesize DNA and other important molecules.</description>

      <description>I founded the curl project early 1998 but had already then been working on the code since November 1996. The source code was always open, free and available to the world.

The one-parameter constructor also serves as a conversion constructor, resulting in the following: Buffer buffer(24);</description>
