      <description>After 65 years at Mad Magazine, comic artist Al Jaffee announced his retirement. Jaffee was best known for his Mad Fold-Ins, where folding the page would reveal a hidden message in the artwork. Plenty of examples can be found on the web. The problem is, they all show the before and after statically,</description>

      <title>The RuboCop Name Drama Redux</title>
      <link>https://metaredux.com/posts/2020/06/08/the-rubocop-name-drama-redux.html</link>
      <description>By now, if you’re part of the Ruby programming community, you’ve probably heard of the proposal to rename RuboCop and the unpleasant events that followed it. I really struggled with coming up with a name for this article, as there are many topics I wanted to touch upon (e.g. the burden of OSS stewardship, being respectful and adhering to the norms that once defined the Ruby community, creating a safe collaborative environment, the final decision about the name, etc), but I’m quite limited in time right now. This generic title is the best that I could, but I hope you will forgive me and focus on the content instead. Once again I got reminded that naming is (very) hard. I don’t really want to go repeat/retell everything that has transpired. The GitHub issue and the surrounding Twitter conversations should give you a good idea. There’s also a nice summary, written by Tim Riley that you can peruse. The purpose of the article you’re reading now is to provide some closure for that topic and a path for us to move forward. So, here we go…</description>

      <title>Nulls not missing anymore</title>
      <link>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/somasegar/nulls-not-missing-anymore</link>
      <description>In the past, I have talked about how your feedback is a critical part of us building the right product. Recently, we took a big DCR (Design Change Request) into Visual Studio 2005 that was in response to your feedback. This was a hard call, because it was a big change that touched many components including the CLR. Nonetheless, we decided to take this change at this late stage in the game because a) this was the right product design and I always believe in optimizing for the long-term and b) I had confidence in the team(s) to be able to get this work done in time for Visual Studio 2005. This is a classic example of how we are listening to your feedback that results in a better product for all of us.</description>

      <title>Lessons from nullable: Superstars + Feedback</title>
      <link>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/jmstall/lessons-from-nullable-superstars-feedback</link>
      <description>First, this is a lesson in super-stars. Some background: this was a major change done very late in the game. That's very risk because if you accidentally break something, then regressions mean slipping the product. The change to the CLR was done by Vance Morrison who, in my opinion, is one of the most talented developers on the CLR. (There is nobody on the debugger team, nor has there ever been, who is Vance's equal, and it clearly shows in the mistakes that manifest in the debugger's design and implementation. Although we've have/had promising talent, they've lacked Vance's seniority and experience.)  IMO, the big challenge with changes like this is not so much just writing the code; it's making a broad complicated change which affects many subsystems without breaking anything. It's big, it's complicated, and it has to be done right. This is a great example of the value in having super-stars. In order to do something like this, you need one superstar that can get the job done. You could throw 20 morons on the problem and easily screw it up. This is why people like Michael Jordan got paid so much - he was the superstar that could come through in the clutch.  This is a well known principle. Joel on Software blogs about this here.
 (Additional trivia: When Vance was assessing the impact of this change, he asked me if this would affect the debugger. It turns out there is some minor impact, but we decided the cost-benefit didn't justify a fix. The issue is you can directly use the ICorDebug API to construct nullable types that can't normally exist in the runtime. The details are for another blog entry...)</description>

      <link>https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1</link>
      <description>This document argues for and describes alternatives that shift specific language conventions used by RFC Authors and RFC Editors to avoid oppressive terminology in the technical documentation of the RFC series. Specifically, this document details two sets of terms that are normalised on the technical level but oppressive on a societal level. First, arguments are presented for why any oppressive terms should be avoided by the IETF/IRTF. Second, problem statements for both sets of terms are presented and alternatives are proposed. There is a third section on additional considerations and general action points to address the RFC series, past and future. Lastly, a summary of recommendations is presented.</description>

      <title>fsharpConf 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkYHYKYeNw</link>
      <description>Welcome to fsharpConf 2020!

You can find the schedule here: http://fsharpconf.com/

We put a lot of effort into organizing this online conference, and we hope it will be a great experience for everyone involved.

Unfortunately the current state of the world is pretty messed up, and we have thought a lot about what we could do and if we should cancel the whole conference. If you have not seen it, this is our statement about the current situation: http://fsharpconf.com/BlackLivesMatter/

We hope that we can spread some good energy by coming together and learning collaboratively.

This conference aims to be a safe place for everyone who is participating. We ask you to show empathy and compassion for other people and the organizers will not tolerate any kind of hate, discriminatory or racial speech.

The action will take place on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkYHYKYeNw

The community conversations will take place directly on YouTube or on the F# Software Foundation Slack. We will announce the appropriate channels during the conference. You need to be a member of the F# Software Foundation (http://foundation.fsharp.org/join) to join the channel (completely free of charge).

We would love to see people spreading the message. The hashtag on twitter will be #fsharpconf, our handle is @fsharponline.

We hope to see you around!

      <title>Faster than radix sort: Kirkpatrick-Reisch sorting</title>
      <link>https://sortingsearching.com/2020/06/06/kirkpatrick-reisch.html</link>
      <description>Radix sort sorts n w-bit integers by splitting them up into chunks of log⁡n\log nlogn bits each, and sorting each chunk in linear time. Thus it achieves O(nw/log⁡n)O(nw/\log n)O(nw/logn) time.</description>

      <title>Gearing up your development environment with IPv6 Prefix Delegation - fnordahl.com</title>
      <link>https://fnordahl.com/2020/06/07/gearing-up-your-development-environment-with-ipv6-prefix-delegation/</link>
      <description>A while back I moved to a house where there was no wired infrastructure
available. The national incumbent had turned off the signals on the old copper
wires long ago without offering any alternatives. A mobile broadband provider
has been the rescue, and while they have provided a service reliable as shared
and wireless services can be, their lack of investment in technology has been
what has bothered me the most. The most prominent effect of the lack of
technology investment was no IPv6 support, which for a communication service
provider is a sure way to paint yourself into a corner.</description>
