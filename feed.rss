      <link>https://www.appvnext.com/blog/2021/10/10/build-maui-apps-in-an-azure-vm</link>

      <title>World&amp;#39;s Smallest C# Program (featuring `N`)</title>
      <link>https://nietras.com/2021/10/09/worlds-smallest-csharp-program/</link>
      <description>TLDR: Tongue in cheek post on how - in .NET 5+ and C# 9+ - the 
smallest possible C# program appears to be {} or 2 characters long. 
This doesn’t do much, though. 
Using N (github, nuget)
you can write a program doing something in 4 characters with e.g. N();
in .NET 6 and C# 10. Along the way learn a few C# 10 and nuget packaging tricks incl.
global usings 
and implicit usings.

      <title>Seed Stage Operating</title>
      <link>https://rrich.io/2021/10/07/seed-stage-operating</link>
      <description>The trap The differences between a first-time founder and a repeat founder are most noticeable during the seed stage. First-time founders want to take their newly acquired funding and put it to use right away. Hiring a team, buying new services, buying more ads, etc. Repeat-founders understand that cash is king, and preserving that funding to extend runway is how you avoid getting rinsed during your next round. Repeat-founders are also acutely aware of what product market fit looks like. This means they understand that dumping gas on a fire that isn’t yet ready for it is a great way to burn through several million dollars in a very short amount of time.</description>

      <description>Memcached and Redis. More different than first appearances would suggest.  From how they use memory to how they expire items, the differences are not as subtle as you would expect.

Specifically, you want to expand to return in a regular function, but co_return in a coroutine. template&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; T&amp;amp;&amp;amp; TraceValue(T&amp;amp;&amp;amp;</description>

      <title>The Fundamentals of Testing with Persistence Layers </title>
      <link>https://www.infoq.com/articles/Testing-With-Persistence-Layers/</link>
      <description>Mocking out dependencies such as databases and other persistence layers lead to ineffective tests. Unfortunately, our industry is also focused on function-level testing to the exclusion of all else, so few are trained on how to write any other type of test. This article seeks to correct the issue by reintroducing the concept of testing with databases.</description>

      <title>How the biggest consumer apps got their first 1,000 users - Issue 25</title>
      <link>https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-apps-got</link>
      <description>Considering every startup confronts this question at some point, I was surprised by how little has been written about it. Particularly anything actionable. So I decided to do my own digging. I spent the past month personally reaching out to founders, scouring interviews, and tapping the Twitterverse. Below, you’ll find first-hand accounts of how essentially every major consumer app acquired their earliest users, including Tinder, Uber, Superhuman, TikTok, Product Hunt, Yelp, and over a dozen more. Enjoy!</description>
