      <title>Optimizing Queries in MySQL: Optimizing Reads - Simple Talk</title>
      <link>https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/mysql/optimizing-queries-in-mysql-optimizing-reads/</link>
      <description>Optimizing read operations is one of the most prominent problems concerning any database administrator. No matter what kind of database management system is in use – MySQL, its flavors like Percona Server or MariaDB, MongoDB, TimescaleDB, SQL Server, or others, read queries are a concern. The primary read query example is SELECT queries, but a lot of this pertains to UPDATE and DELETE as well since they too have to fetch rows to be operated on.</description>

      <link>https://hire.jonasgalvez.com.br/2023/jan/31/fastify-testing/</link>
      <description>One of the most popular training programs for our customers at NodeSource is the Testing Workshop, which includes a general introduction to testing but quickly dives into hands-on Fastify examples and CI/CD with GitHub Workflows. I thought I&amp;#39;d take a few essential Fastify bits from this training and have it in a blog post, for quick future reference.</description>

      <title>tools for finding information on the internet</title>
      <link>https://roman.computer/finding_information/</link>
      <description>Isn’t the internet such a magically useful tool? Thirty years ago, if you wanted to know how many plays Shakespeare wrote, you would have to physically walk to your local library and find a relevant book. Now, you can find the answer in less than ten seconds, at any time, wherever you are.
However, the internet is not a truthful, superintelligent oracle. Rather, it’s a dangerous jungle of knowledge you must learn to navigate if you wish to find the truth.</description>

      <title>My first recession</title>
      <link>https://gadi.fm/posts/recession/</link>
      <description>There’s an entire generation going through a recession for the first time.
Sure, everyone says we need to adapt, and while true, I think the phenomenon in itself – going through a recession for the first time – is a key paradigm shift for all of us first-timers. I’ll try capturing some of it here through my personal experience.
I was a one-year-old when the Dotcom bubble burst, and I was 9 when the Great Recession started.</description>
