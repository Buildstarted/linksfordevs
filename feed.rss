      <title>The indifference engine</title>
      <link>https://ponnekanti.net/posts/the-indifference-engine/</link>
      <description>It‚Äôs just insane that language models actually work. How is it possible. The world is enchanted. Do you still feel it? A kind of feverish awe? My computer can talk to me, it can teach me, yet it possesses no greater essence than its transistors‚Ä¶
Except I don‚Äôt really feel like that. Not often, certainly not constantly. I think the most beautiful thing about it all to me is how one is forced to constantly excite themselves into this state. It would be so easy to let it slip into normalcy. ‚ÄúOK. Guess my laptop can talk to me now and teach me anything‚Äù. Accept and move on. Kids using them to cheat on their essays. Out of nowhere, eldritch magic cast into our computers, and just like that effortlessly integrated into life. The machine is not human-shaped. The human is machine-shaped. We can accept anything, this is the rule that governs us.</description>

      <title>Coffee and Open Source Conversation - David Whitney</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=FK6DdD5ke9Y</link>
      <description>David is the Director of Architecture for NewDay, and the founder of Electric Head Software. Focusing on iterative software delivery, developer mentoring and cultural change - mostly working with London-based organisations.

He speaks about software design, culture, and ethics in technology - rounded out by an assortment of talks about software that probably doesn't need to exist but makes the world a little more fun. David has previously served as the chief coding technical architect for JustGiving and helped market-leading organisations including JUST-EAT, Trainline and Vodafone improve their technical capabilities.

David is a Microsoft MVP, has been part of the OpenUK Honours list for open-source advocacy, and is a twice bestselling author of children's books about programming.

There's a chance you've seen him talk at a spread of conferences, user groups and code-dojos around the UK over the last decade or indulged in bar-room programming debates after one.
