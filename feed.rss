      <link>https://nathanganser.com/blog/how-to-create-a-spotify-like-recap-video-for-30k-users</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;ve always been a huge fan of Spotify&amp;#39;s Rewind videos, and as the end of the year was approaching, I thought we should do something like this for Oniri: a popular dream journal on IOS that I&amp;#39;ve been working for these past months.</description>

      <link>https://muscaw.dev/2023/01/06/backup-your-code/</link>
      <description>Have you ever heard about the saying Not your server, not your data or Cloud is someone else&amp;amp;rsquo;s computer?
These sayings are there to remind everyone of the risks that can happen when you trust a service with all of your data. What happens if you put all of your family photos on Google Photos and your account is closed one day with a cryptic reason and you have no recourse?</description>

      <title>Giving Away Your Mind to Technology</title>
      <link>https://poyashad.com/posts/giving-away-your-mind-to-technology/</link>
      <description>I was born and raised in Stockholm, a fairly small capital compared to others with a current population of approximately one million. It is made up of small islands connected by bridges, so learning to find and navigate the city is fairly easy and you learn quickly.
But, like any other capital city, when there is traffic you can be stuck. This is where Waze comes in. It is one of the apps I use regularly and is an important part of my smartphone.</description>

      <title>Why am I obsessed with server frameworks?</title>
      <link>https://blog.cohix.network/why-am-i-obsessed-with-server-frameworks/</link>
      <description>There&amp;#39;s something that bugs me about the current generation of server development frameworks. There&amp;#39;s something about the rote &amp;quot;router that feeds into middleware and a handler&amp;quot; that feels in need of a shakeup.

One of the first things I built in the early days of Suborbital was Vektor, my idea</description>

      <title>I scanned every package on PyPi and found 57 live AWS keys</title>
      <link>https://tomforb.es/i-scanned-every-package-on-pypi-and-found-57-live-aws-keys/</link>
      <description>After inadvertently finding that InfoSys leaked an AWS key on PyPi I wanted to know how many other live AWS keys may be present on Python package index. After scanning every release published to PyPi I found 57 valid access keys from organisations like:
Amazon themselves &amp;#128517; Intel Stanford, Portland and Louisiana University The Australian Government General Atomics fusion department Terradata Delta Lake And Top Glove, the worlds largest glove manufacturer &amp;#129508; This post outlines the way I scanned PyPi, showcases a project I’ve built that automatically scans all new PyPi releases to notify AWS of potentially leaked keys, presents some analysis of the keys I’ve found and draws a few conclusions at the end.</description>
