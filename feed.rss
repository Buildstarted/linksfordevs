      <description>Initially I set out to support a scenario where an user could be part of multiple tenants and have different permissions to each tenant. This has since changed and an user can now only belong to one tenant. The authentication part is taken care of by an external provider, but</description>

      <title>Looking at C# 12 Proposals and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://michaelscodingspot.com/csharp-12-proposals/</link>
      <description>C# has been through a lot of change in the last decade. From open-sourcing the language to a new cross-platform framework to yearly releases instead of 3-year iterations. Meanwhile, new languages, new frameworks, and new paradigms have taken off in the software industry, including the rise in popularity of Node.js, TypeScript, Kotlin, Rust, Go, and Python. Through it all, C# and .NET stayed relevant and popular. In this blog post, we’ll glimpse the day-to-day activity and challenges the C# language design team faces.</description>

      <title>Dual-booting NixOS and Alpine Linux without root partitions</title>
      <link>https://adnab.me/blog/2023/2023-04-02-rootless-nixos-alpine.html</link>
      <description>Last week I read this post and I
thought that it was a nice idea to try to setup a NixOS install which
has no on-disk root partition. This means that the content of everything
in /etc, /var, … is rebuilt from scratch at
each boot. The only partitions that are actually required are
/nix for the Nix store, and /boot that
contains the kernel, initramfs and bootloader config to boot the
system.</description>

      <title>Nix and direnv &amp;#183; Way Enough</title>
      <link>https://www.danielcorin.com/posts/nix-and-direnv/</link>
      <description>I know a little about nix.
Not a lot.
I know some things about Python virtual environments, asdf and a few things about package managers.
I’ve heard the combo of direnv and nix is fantastic from a number of engineers I trust, but I haven’t had the chance to figure out what these tools can really do.
I could totally ask someone what their setup is, but I decided to ask ChatGPT (gpt-4) to see what would happen.
The following is the summary of what I did that worked, as instructed and summarized by the LM, with a bit of editing and commentary by me.</description>
