      <description>I&amp;#39;ve recently moved my Markdown Monster Desktop Application to .NET 7.0 and I had to make a decision on how to get the Runtime installed or packaged with my application.

      <link>https://www.techwatching.dev/posts/vuecicd-ci</link>
      <description>When working on a project, you typically focus on a specific feature at a time, making changes on a dedicated branch for that feature. When it&amp;#39;s time for you to integrate these modifications into the project&amp;#39;s code base, the code base has likely evolved since you began working on your feature, as other team members have also pushed their work. That&amp;#39;s why your code changes may introduce errors in the application you are developing.</description>

      <title>.NET Rocks! Azure Developer CLI with Savannah Ostrowski</title>
      <link>https://www.dotnetrocks.com/details/1851</link>
      <description>How do you get your app running in Azure? Carl and Richard talk to Savannah Ostrowski about Azure Developer CLI (azd), an open-source tool to help developers using .NET, Javascript/Typescript, Python, Java, and more to get deployed into Azure. Savannah talks about staying high-level with azd commands, keeping the complexity of deployment pipelines in tools you already know how to use, like Bicep and Terraform. The conversation digs into the templating system to help assemble all the platforms and elements of an Azure deployment, depending on your application. There are a ton of options - check it out!</description>

      <description>Most decisions that you make are not nearly as important as your ability to change them in the future.  When designing systems, it’s easy to get caught up in the minutia of each decision that has to be made along the way. Technical systems may raise concerns about choosing the appropriate logging framework or determining the most effective concurrency model. Human systems may instead be concerned with how many meetings to hold, with whom, and how often.</description>
