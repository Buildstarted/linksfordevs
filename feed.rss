      <title>Cloudflare took down our website after trying to force us to pay 120k$ within 24h</title>
      <link>https://robindev.substack.com/p/cloudflare-took-down-our-website</link>
      <description>TL;DR: We&amp;#39;ve been on the Cloudflare Business plan ($250/month) for years. They suddenly contacted us and asked us to either pay them $120k up front for one year of Enterprise within 24 hours or they would take down all of our domains. While this escalated up our business we had 3 sales calls with them, trying to figure out what was happening and how to reach a reasonable contract in a week. When we told them we were also in talks with Fastly, they suddenly &amp;quot;purged&amp;quot; all our domains, causing huge downtime in our core business, sleepless nights migrating away from CF, irreparable loss in customer trust and weeks of ongoing downtime in our internal systems.</description>

      <title>Why you spend more when prices end in .99 - Kent Hendricks</title>
      <link>https://kenthendricks.com/99-cent-prices/</link>
      <description>I once worked at a company that priced everything with a .95 ending. The bestselling software package was $999.95. Add-on products were $9.95, or $19.95, or $49.95. Everything ended with a .95. It had been this way for more than twenty years. One day, one of the VPs suggested we change all prices to end […]</description>

      <title>Developers aren&amp;#39;t Nerds | 0xFF</title>
      <link>https://0xff.nu/dev-and-nerd</link>
      <description>For the longest of time, I was under the impression that developers and programmers, for the most part, are as or even more so interested in technology, tools, efficiency and productivity as I am. This came from the somewhat outdated understanding that the barrier of entry into programming was mentally taxing and required fucking around with compiling, development environment et al.</description>

      <title>Abusing Go&amp;#39;s infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://reverse.put.as/2024/05/24/abusing-go-infrastructure/</link>
      <description>I apologize if this information is already known, but I couldn’t find any references about it and I wanted to understand what was going on and share with you because I think there is some value doing it.
In case this wasn’t known, I apologize to the Go team for not talking to them first and jumping the full disclosure gun (I don’t think it’s that severe). I really like Go!</description>
