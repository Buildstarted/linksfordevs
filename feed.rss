      <description>After covering and collecting multiple parts of LINQ explained with sketches I bundled them all together in a small booklet with more explanation and code samples.
Therefore I present: LINQ explained with sketches - the eBook. Over 30 pages with smaller explanations and more LINQ operations than in my last post. Litte Bonus: There are interactive links with smaller examples to fiddle around with.

      <title>Keeping Content Out of the Publish Folder for WebDeploy</title>
      <link>https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Aug/24/Keeping-Content-Out-of-the-Publish-Folder-for-WebDeploy</link>
      <description>Sometimes when you publish a project to the server, you need to keep certain content that&amp;#39;s part of your local development from publishing to the server. You can control how MSBuild publishing handles file output in a myriad of ways and it can be confusing if you don&amp;#39;t know the exact settings you need to set for each scenario. In this post I discuss various options available include using the project item settings and the options in the pubxml file along with some commentary on when you might need this functionality. </description>

      <title>In Defense of DevOps</title>
      <link>https://mikevanbuskirk.io/posts/in-defense-of-devops/</link>
      <description>Lately there seems to be a growing chorus within software engineering that DevOps is “dead”, or at least an abject failure.
I’d argue it is more important than ever before. Software delivery is an increasingly complex beast, fraught with security threats and requiring a pragmatic and nuanced approach to operational excellence.</description>

      <title>Certificate Transparency is really not a replacement for key pinning</title>
      <link>https://emilymstark.com/2022/08/23/certificate-transparency-is-really-not-a-replacement-for-key-pinning.html</link>
      <description>I’ve noticed that there’s a common misconception that Certificate Transparency is a replacement for HTTP public key pinning. If those words make no sense to you: HTTP public key pinning was a now-mostly-defunct mechanism whereby websites could “pin” themselves to a set of public keys, so that browsers would not accept a certificate for that website’s hostname unless one of those pinned public keys appeared in its certificate chain. Certificate Transparency is a system whereby certificates must be logged in public append-only logs, so that domain owners can observe them as they are issued and detect malicious certificates (see my previous overview here).</description>

      <description>No models are perfect, but in drug discovery, the models are terrible. This is widely understood yet widely disregarded. Finding new drugs requires sifting through the practically infinite space of possible molecules to find the one that is very specifically going to nudge a human&amp;#39;s chaotic biology in a very specific direction. Doing this faster and cheaper is core to human flourishing. Yet, innovation in how we perform this search is lacking and often misdirected.</description>

      <title>Strongly Typed Middleware in ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/359/strongly-typed-middleware-in-asp-net-core</link>
      <description>Most ASP.NET Core developers are familiar with the traditional way to author 
middleware classes which is based on conventions. The vast majority of examples 
out there feature the convention-based approach. But 
there is also a strongly typed approach available which is based on implementing 
the IMiddleware interface. This seems to be one of ASP.NET Core&amp;#39;s 
best kept secrets, so I thought I&amp;#39;d pull the curtains back and let some light 
shine on it.</description>
