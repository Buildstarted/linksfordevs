      <title>How to Build a $20 Billion Semiconductor Fab</title>
      <link>https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-a-20-billion-semiconductor</link>
      <description>For the last several decades, one avenue of technological progress has towered over nearly everything else: semiconductors. Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer.</description>

      <title>I&amp;#39;m turning 30 so naturally I&amp;#39;m switching to OpenBSD</title>
      <link>https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/i-m-turning-30-so-i-m-switching-to-openbsd/</link>
      <description>I’m kidding, I’m switching to OpenBSD because I like security or code quality or something.
It’s totally not because the inexorable march of aging is starting to show its effects on my ability to down necessary-evil trivia like me and my friends used to down forties in the Ahhhnald after dark, and so I’d like to settle down with a software ecosystem I can study in real depth once without feeling like 20% of what I absorb in year X will be deprecated by year X+10.</description>

      <title>Supply chain attacks and the many (other) different ways I’ve backdoored your dependencies</title>
      <link>https://joshua.hu/how-I-backdoored-your-supply-chain</link>
      <description>I recently read a blog post with a similar title as this one, which outlined different supply chain attacks on CI/CD pipelines, and largely focused on software immediately related to the deployment and development of products. Although the post contained a few well-known attacks, I thought I could expand on them with a greater focus on supply chains which may not be noticed by (especially) smaller organizations. Variations and combinations of each of these may also be a concern.</description>
