      <title>Speed Up Django Queries with values() over only()</title>
      <link>https://johnnymetz.com/posts/django-values-over-only/</link>
      <description>If your Django queries feel slow, the problem might not be your database — it might be your ORM. Recently, I was working with a query that took 25 seconds to run through the Django ORM, but the underlying SQL completed in just 2 seconds. With a single change, I got the ORM query down to 2 seconds as well — and reduced the memory footprint by 70%.
Let’s walk through what happened, and why using .values() instead of .only() can dramatically improve performance.</description>
