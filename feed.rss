      <title>[Monkey Conf 2024] Designer first UI development</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=3m3oIkjEI3g</link>
      <description>Implementations that do not match design specs. Behavior redesigns that misalign with architecture. Friction between designer and programmers. General frustration in both sides. Designer first UI development purpose is to minimize those situations or eliminating them completely. In essence it based around letting designers build the UI themselves, so there is nothing between their vision and execution. Programmers provide tools and support but never build the actual layouts. This is nothing new, level designers have been doing this for a long time in game development. They build the levels, and programming provides the tools and support but never get in the middle. This changes the relationship between departments completely from confrontational to collaborative. Since programming responsibility is to empower and support the designers.

      <title>Superposition as a Super Datalog</title>
      <link>https://www.philipzucker.com/superpose_datalog/</link>
      <description>Resolution is an old technique in automated reasoning. Datalog is a family of languages capable of expressing recursive database queries. The ancestry of datalog can be traced back to resolution and it is interesting and fruitful to examine the capabilities of modern resolution style provers in light of the use cases and operational interpretability of datalog.</description>

      <description>Once in a while, there is a disaster. Phone lines go out, the Internet breaks down, and mobiles don&amp;#39;t work. Then the Ham Radio Operators save the day. Amateur radio is one of those things I&amp;#39;m only vaguely aware of. It chugs along in the background unnoticed. It doesn&amp;#39;t follow the fashion of today&amp;#39;s industry, nor does it chase growth at all costs. It is an open standard, run by a decentralised group of people rather than a corporation, and it favours relentless practicality rather than KPIs. I …</description>
