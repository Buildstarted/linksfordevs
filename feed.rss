      <title>A Quants Approach to Running</title>
      <link>https://dm13450.github.io/2023/06/01/A-Quants-Approach-to-Running.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been training for a marathon and it is a personal habit to let data take over my life for each of my hobbies. I’ve built apps that track my badminton scores, golf struggles, and now I’ve gone all analytical on my running. This post is a summary of how I’ve approached my training and used the science and data approach to try and maximise my performance.</description>

      <title>Using ChatGPT for Task Classification</title>
      <link>https://www.spryngtime.com/post/harnessing-chatgpt-to-revolutionize-task-classification-a-deep-dive</link>
      <description>One of the biggest challenges we face at Spryngtime in AI-powered customer support is the wide range of intents behind customer support requests. From &amp;quot;Where&amp;#39;s my order?&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Does your product do X?&amp;quot;, the needs of our users can vary tremendously, and the manner in which these requests should be handled differs just as much. As a result, the &amp;quot;one prompt fits all&amp;quot; approach simply doesn&amp;#39;t cut it. Instead, we&amp;#39;ve had to become more creative in how we handle and classify the multitude of requests we receive daily. This blog post delves into how we&amp;#39;ve leveraged ChatGPT&amp;#39;s power to achieve this.</description>

      <title>The Killer Use Case for LLMs Is Summarization</title>
      <link>https://www.sebastianmellen.com/post/2023/the-killer-use-case-for-llms-is-summarization/</link>
      <description>The killer use case for large language models (LLMs) is clearly summarization. At least today, in my limited experience, LLMs are incapable of generating unique insights. While LLMs are good at writing creatively regurgitated text based on certain inputs or writing generally about a topic, they’re unlikely to “think” something unique. However, LLMs appear to be quite good at knowing what they do and don’t know, and this is especially true when they are provided with a clear chunk of information or text to summarize.</description>

      <title>Cities of Software</title>
      <link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/engineering/cities-of-software/</link>
      <description>Photo by Adrian Schwarz on Unsplash
Cities are an interesting way to think about Software. Cities have foundations, like infrastructure for cars, electricity. Housing for people to live and work. Stores to sell and buy goods. Also, Cities are often referred to as an organism. Just like a large organization, a department, or a team are an organism. But these organisms are building software.
I first came across this idea in Mikio Braun’s post on Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating Software :</description>

      <description>How can OpenAI help you program faster? Carl and Richard talk to Mark Miller about his experiments with OpenAI and CodeRush. Mark talks about the power of building agents to analyze code to write comments and tests - in parallel so that multiple agents can run simultaneously. Then the conversation turns to the potential of a voice interface as an effective way to work with Visual Studio - you were talking anyway!</description>
