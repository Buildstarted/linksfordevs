      <title>Advancements in machine learning for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://blog.research.google/2023/12/advancements-in-machine-learning-for.html</link>
      <description>With the recent and accelerated advances in machine learning (ML), machines can understand natural language, engage in conversations, draw images, create videos and more. Modern ML models are programmed and trained using ML programming frameworks, such as TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, among many others. These libraries provide high-level instructions to ML practitioners, such as linear algebra operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution, etc.) and neural network layers (e.g., 2D convolution layers, transformer layers). Importantly, practitioners need not worry about how to make their models run efficiently on hardware because an ML framework will automatically optimize the user&amp;#39;s model through an underlying compiler. The efficiency of the ML workload, thus, depends on how good the compiler is. A compiler typically relies on heuristics to solve complex optimization problems, often resulting in suboptimal performance.</description>

      <title>Christmas Countdown: #8 Code maintenance is 90% of the work</title>
      <link>https://www.codeart.dk/blog/2023/12/christmas-countdown-8-code-maintenance-is-90-of-the-work/</link>
      <description>Greenfield development is by far the most fun for everybody. So it&amp;#39;s easy to forget that most development work is actually maintenance. And every new line of code you write means more code to maintain. Almost all codebases I review have significant technical debt. And the debt starts to accumulate from the moment you start coding.</description>

      <title>What punch cards teach us about AI risk – The Observation Deck</title>
      <link>https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2023/11/26/what-punch-cards-teach-us-about-ai-risk/</link>
      <description>I (finally) read Edwin Black’s IBM and the Holocaust, and I can’t recommend it strongly enough.  This book had been on my queue for years, and I put it off for the same reason that you have probably put it off:  we don’t like to confront difficult things.  But the book is superlative:  not only is it fascinating and well-researched but given the current level of anxiety about the consequences of technological development, it feels especially timely.  Black makes clear in his preface that IBM did not cause the Holocaust (unequivocally, the Holocaust would have happened without IBM), but he also makes clear in the book that information management was essential to every aspect of the Nazi war machine — and that that information management  was made possible through IBM equipment and (especially) their punch cards.</description>
