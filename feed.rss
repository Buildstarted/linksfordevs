      <title>Wireless is a trap</title>
      <link>https://www.benkuhn.net/wireless/</link>
      <description>Over and over again, I’ve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go “wow, I had no idea how much better this could be!” • Wireless protocols often silently operate in an extremely degraded state that makes them substantially worse than wired equivalents.</description>

      <title>Writing a curriculum vitæ</title>
      <link>https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/cv/</link>
      <description>I have been giving a lot of feedback about how to write a better
curriculum vitæ (CV) recently. This post is a way of structuring
and disseminating my thoughts on this matter. As a start, let me briefly
delineate what this post is not about: I am not discussing how to
write a resume. A resume is typically only a single page long and
should provide all information pertinent to a very specific job. A CV,
by contrast, can be any length and usually contains all details
pertinent to your professional life.</description>

      <title>Reviews of distributed filesystems | Regressionist</title>
      <link>http://www.regressionist.com/2020/06/20/reviews-of-distributed-filesystems/</link>
      <description>I have a lot of data to work with, and I want to do it with just my mismatched bunch of servers, desktops, SSDs, and spinning disks. My equipment is old, so I want a filesystem that is robust not only to the failure of any drive, but also to the failure of any one machine. My preference is to build a hyper-converged system, where each machine hosts data in addition to working on compute jobs. Following are reviews I found on the main open-source distributed filesystems out there:</description>

      <description>The song draws inspiration from an incident on March 18th, 2016 involving a house in North Carolina Cole had rented to use as a studio, called the “Sheltuh.” The house was raided by SWAT team members after complaints from neighbors who assumed the house was being used to produce and sell drugs. To the neighbors' surprise, no drugs were found in the “Sheltuh,” just a recording studio in the basement.</description>

      <title>Wireless is a trap - LessWrong 2.0</title>
      <link>https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8hxvfZiqH24oqyr6y/wireless-is-a-trap</link>
      <description>I used to be an anti-wire crusader. I hated the clutter of cables, and my
tendency to unconsciously chew on them if they got anywhere near my face. But
running into bug after tricky wireless bug—mostly while trying to make my video
calls work better—I’ve apostasized. The more I’ve learned about wifi, Bluetooth
and related protocols, the more I’m convinced that they’re often worse, on net,
than wires.

For instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet
service provider. That’s understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced
oligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However,
every time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their
connection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the
easiest fix has been to run a cable.

Wifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they “just
work.” But if you investigate, you’ll often find that the wireless link is
operating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent.
Since this degradation is silent, it’s often not obvious that the problem is the
wireless—instead, you’ll probably conclude that it’s your device/software/self.

Over and over again, I’ve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go 
“wow, I had no idea how much better this could be!"

Fig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.
Recently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk’s wireless devices with
wired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and
break my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the
same level of tidiness, with much better reliability, quality and speed. I no
longer have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery,
or spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk. It’s
dramatically reduced my level of device-related agony.

To illustrate the degree of agony I’m</description>

      <title>A little bit of plain Javascript can do a lot</title>
      <link>https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/06/19/a-little-bit-of-plain-javascript-can-do-a-lot/</link>
      <description>I’ve never worked as a professional frontend developer, so even though I’ve been writing HTML/CSS/JS for 15 years for little side projects, all of the projects have been pretty small, sometimes I don’t write any Javascript for years in between, and I often don’t quite feel like I know what I’m doing.
Partly because of that, I’ve leaned on libraries a lot! Ten years ago I used to use jQuery, and since maybe 2017 I’ve been using a lot of vue.</description>

      <title>How is NSA breaking so much crypto?</title>
      <link>https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2015/10/14/how-is-nsa-breaking-so-much-crypto/</link>
      <description>There have been rumors for years that the NSA can decrypt a significant fraction of encrypted Internet traffic. In 2012, James Bamford published an article quoting anonymous former NSA officials stating that the agency had achieved a “computing breakthrough” that gave them “the ability to crack current public encryption.” The Snowden documents also hint at some extraordinary capabilities: they show that NSA has built extensive infrastructure to intercept and decrypt VPN traffic and suggest that the agency can decrypt at least some HTTPS and SSH connections on demand.</description>

      <link>https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/</link>
      <description>I estimated that I had used my mac for approximately 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, 48 weeks a year, for 7 years straight, for a total for whopping 16800 hours. I have written the first versions of most of the software components of my startup using this computer. And all this time, this machine worked without a hiccup. It was never repaired, and I never opened the back cover. However, its battery is getting swollen, so it is a good time to upgrade to a newer machine. Before recycling the machine, I decided to open it for once and vacuum the fans to see if it makes a difference. Oh boy, did it make a difference! You can find the fan test in the video if you want to check it out.</description>
