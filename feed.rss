      <description>Michael Outlaw is a father, husband, and software developer based out of Atlanta, GA. A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory.</description>

      <title>On legitimacy and software engineering</title>
      <link>https://www.sicpers.info/2023/07/on-legitimacy-and-software-engineering/</link>
      <description>More than 400,000 software engineers have lost their jobs in the last couple of years, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s really significantly more than half a million as some won’t have been documented anywhere that the tracker project saw. In the years leading up to Layoffapalooza, software engineers commanded high salaries (though maybe not universally high) , often with significant perks. Do these shifts in employability privileges reflect a change in the legitimacy software engineering enjoys among its peers, clients, and other stakeholders?</description>

      <title>Going Lean • Lea Verou</title>
      <link>https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/going-lean/</link>
      <description>WordPress has been with me since my very first post in 2009.
There is a lot to love about it: It’s open source, it has a thriving ecosystem, a beautiful default theme, and a revolutionary block editor that makes my inner UX geek giddy.
Plus, WP made building a website and publishing content accessible to everyone.
No wonder it’s the most popular CMS in the world, by a huge margin.</description>
