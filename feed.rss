      <title>More Effective Remote Working</title>
      <link>https://mikemcquaid.com/more-effective-remote-working/</link>
      <description>COVID-19 was many people’s first introduction to the working-from-home experience. I’ve been lucky enough to have been working from home exclusively since 2009 and at US-based companies (e.g. GitHub) since 2012. I’ve also been an EU-based open-source maintainer since 2007 and maintaining the globally-distributed Homebrew package manager since 2009. These experiences have helped me learn some tips on how to be more effective working remotely that I’d like to share with you:</description>

There are thousands of articles, courses, and guides on how to build a roadmap for product managers. Even with all these resources, roadmaps often end up being a point of contention between product managers and their stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Please Kindly Leave Stdout Alone When Printing Your Beautiful Logo</title>
      <link>https://citrinefox.com/posts/2023-09-02-leave-stdout-alone/</link>
      <description>It was many years ago. At my to-be-previous job, we wanted to try some new modeling things. We grabbed the then-latest TensorFlow docker image (Since the model was based on TensorFlow—I forget which one though) and it spun up smoothly. The container even printed a pretty logo in colorful ASCII art as shown in the cover image.
The experiments went well. We eventually packed some more dependencies and an sshd (and some sort of init, of course) in, and asked IT to put the image on a shared GPU box.</description>

      <description>A model I return to a lot when talking about engineering processes is Push and Pull. Often when we design a new process or system we struggle to get buy-in. That lack of buy-in can often be traced to having forgotten the Push, the Pull, or both.</description>

      <title>Simulation extractable versions of Groth’s zk-SNARK revisited - International Journal of Information Security</title>
      <link>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10207-023-00750-7</link>
      <description>Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are the most efficient proof systems in terms of proof size and verification. Currently, Groth’s scheme from EUROCRYPT 2016, $$	extsf{Groth16}$$ Groth 16 , is the state-of-the-art and is widely deployed in practice. $$	extsf{Groth16}$$ Groth 16 is originally proven to achieve knowledge soundness, which does not guarantee the non-malleability of proofs. There has been considerable progress in presenting new zk-SNARKs or modifying $$	extsf{Groth16}$$ Groth 16 to efficiently achieve strong Simulation extractability, which is shown to be a necessary requirement in some applications. In this paper, we revise the Random oracle based variant of $$	extsf{Groth16}$$ Groth 16 proposed by Bowe and Gabizon, BG18, the most efficient one in terms of prover efficiency and CRS size among the candidates, and present a more efficient variant that saves 2 pairings in the verification and 1 group element in the proof. This supersedes our preliminary construction, presented in CANS 2020 (Baghery et al. in CANS 20, volume 12579 of LNCS, Springer, Heidelberg. pp 453-461, 2020), which saved 1 pairing in the verification, and was proven in the generic group model. Our new construction also improves on BG18 in that our proofs are in the algebraic group model with Random Oracles and reduces security to standard computational assumptions in bilinear groups (as opposed to using the full power of the generic group model (GGM)). We implement our proposed simulation extractable zk-SNARK (SE zk-SNARK) along with BG18 in the Arkworks library, and compare the efficiency of our scheme with some related works. Our empirical experiences confirm that our SE zk-SNARK is more efficient than all previous simulation extractable (SE) schemes in most dimensions and it has very close efficiency to the original $$	extsf{Groth16}$$ Groth 16 .</description>

      <description>Visual Studio has been supporting external sources debugging and decompilation for some time now. However, with the release of Visual Studio 17.6, the debugger took a significant leap forward by introducing Auto-decompilation for .NET libraries making the External sources debugging in Visual Studio much more streamlined and effortless. Its integrated decompiler, it decompiles external code in real-time and seamlessly incorporates it into the debugger as needed.</description>

      <description>I figured I’d mix things up a little bit and write a post that has nothing to do with computers or software development.
At my previous apartment in the Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, there was a utility pole right outside my apartment that was a real eyesore. My pole wasn’t particularly special, most utility poles in the neighborhood looked like this: wires snaking out in every direction, across the street, tangling through trees, etc.</description>

      <description>I love music. I&amp;#39;m also broke. I care a lot about the quality of audio I&amp;#39;m listening: I want to hear every instrument and feel fully immersed in the music, but it&amp;#39;s widely known that good audio quality is expensive. Right? Not exactly. There is an abundance of incredible sounding audio equipment that you can get for surprisingly cheap, as long as you know what to look for. Along with this, repurposing older technology can allow you to stream high fidelity music relatively inexpensively.</description>
