This post will give a back-of-the-envelope calculation to show that this idea is plausible.

      <description>I have fortnightly piano lessons with an extremely young teacher - yes, I left Asia only to become more Asian than I ever was back home. At a guess, I would say he&amp;#39;s about 21 years old - very cool. Long hair, a very laid back manner of speech, and always ready with some fascinating detail about whatever piece we&amp;#39;re working on.</description>

      <link>https://rayspace.dev/blog/minimalism-in-web-development</link>
      <description>Disclaimer: This is not a call for all developers to drop frameworks and this is not aimed at discrediting
        any developer or their work, but rather to illustrate different philosophies in web
        development. While it&amp;#39;s not about being anti-framework or proclaiming minimalism as the superior approach, it&amp;#39;s
        more about shedding light on this viable, often underrated strategy.</description>

      <title>From Dating to Vector Search - &amp;quot;Stable Marriages&amp;quot; on a Global Scale &amp;#128141;</title>
      <link>https://ashvardanian.com/posts/searching-stable-marriages/</link>
      <description>How can the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics, Vector Search, and the world of dating come together? What are the implications for the future of databases? And why do Multi-Modal AI model evaluation datasets often fall short? Synopsis:
Stable Marriages are generally computed from preference lists. Those consume too much memory. Instead, one can dynamically recalculate candidate lists using a scalable Vector Search engine. However, achieving this depends on having high-quality representations in a shared Vector Space.</description>

      <link>https://lgug2z.com/articles/notado-07-2023-update/</link>
      <description>The last few months have seen a flurry of changes on major social media websites like Twitter and Reddit with regards to API access. This has also resulted in a number of new competitors seeing rapid growth and becoming new hubs for online discussion.
Let&amp;amp;rsquo;s start with the first point: you will always be able to save Reddit comments and Tweets to Notado by highlighting and saving a text selection. This doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t require any API access or scraping, and it will always work because it only relies on what is visible in your browser.</description>

      <title>NTP Implementation in Elixir</title>
      <link>https://0x7f.dev/post/ntp-implementation-in-elixir/</link>
      <description>The idea So everything started off with the idea that I can somehow fake uptime of a machine by updating the time against a “corrupted” NTP that will lie about the time. Since there isn’t such a thing as a lying NTP server I decided to create one.
This will be an exercise in reverse engineering a protocol, some Linux command line tricks, bitstring manipulation in Elixir, and some various other tricks.</description>

      <link>http://feed.azuredevops.show/mike-brind-on-razor-pages-in-action-episode-253</link>
      <description>Mike Brind spent the first 20 years of his working life in a series of successful sales and marketing roles, towards the end of which he was introduced to HTML and databases. A dormant inner geek took over and Mike became very much more interested in developing websites than selling advertising space on them. &amp;amp;nbsp; As well as books such as those in the Wrox Beginner series, Mike became reliant on the enormous amount of free help provided by online communities while he learned his new craft. Mike is now one of the all-time leading contributors to the official ASP.NET forums at  and is also a moderator there. &amp;amp;nbsp; As a result of his contributions to the ASP.NET community via the forums, and through his technical article site at , Mike received the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for ASP.NET from 2008 to 2018. Beginning ASP.NET Web Pages with WebMatrix is Mike’s first book. &amp;amp;nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:06] How did Mike decide to leave school to become a programmer? [5:42] Jeffrey and his son are programming their own video game! [7:17] What sparked his interest in Razor and writing his new book, ? [9:51] What is the framework that Mike uses in his day-to-day job? [10:37] How would Mike classify the types of websites or web applications that are perfect for Razor pages, and maybe had some difficulties with other frameworks? [14:16] Are there any commonalities that you lose if you do the application with Razor pages and not MVC? [16:32] How does Mike organize his feature folders? [18:12] How Mike organizes test libraries and test cases. [20:06] What has been Mike’s experience with ? [21:02] What’s coming in the future of Razor and Blazor? [24:39] The modernization jump for people who have old classic ASP applications is Razor pages. &amp;amp;nbsp; Mentioned in this Episodes:     — New Video Podcast!

      <title>Top 8 Most Demanded Programming Languages in 2023
</title>
      <link>https://www.devjobsscanner.com/blog/top-8-most-demanded-programming-languages/</link>
      <description>Ever wondered which is the most demanded programming language in 2023? Although there are more than 200+ programming languages, only few of them are used in the real world industry. Knowing this information is essential to succeed in the developer job industry. In the last 17 months (from Jan-2022 to May-2023), DevJobsScanner has analyzed more than 7M developer jobs. From that 7M jobs, DevJobsScanner has only picked the job offers that explicitly required a programming language. Job offers with 4+ language or stack requirements were discarded.
