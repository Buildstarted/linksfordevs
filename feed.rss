      <title>Bored? How about trying a Linux speed run?</title>
      <link>https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/04/11/pengrun/</link>
      <description>I have a lot of dumb ideas.  I tend to write them down and then revisit 
them from time to time.  Sometimes, the world and/or my own 
understanding of it has moved enough to where it can now be taken to a 
new place.  Sometimes these ideas then "snap together" to inspire 
something else entirely.  This is one of those times.</description>

      <title>John Conway 1/6 [The Free Will Lectures] - Free Will and Determinism [2009]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmx2tpcdKZY</link>
      <description>Lecture 1 | Free Will Lecture Series | Meet John Conway; hear about Simon Kochen and how the theorem came about. Thoughts on senility. Free will and determinism in science and philosophy over the last two millennia; the implications of Newtonian and quantum mechanics. What Conway and Kochen mean by “free will.” What the theorem does, and doesn’t, imply about behavior. A brief introduction to the three underlying principles of the theorem: SPIN, FIN, and TWIN. The idea of talking to particles, and how it’s like playing 20 questions with your sisters.

The Free Will lectures
2009, Princeton University.

      <title>Things That Turbo Pascal is Smaller Than</title>
      <link>https://prog21.dadgum.com/116.html</link>
      <description>Turbo Pascal 3 for MS-DOS was released in September 1986. Being version 3, there were lesser releases prior to it and flashier ones after, but 3 was a solid representation of the Turbo Pascal experience: a full Pascal compiler, including extensions that it made it practical for commercial use, tightly integrated with an editor. And the whole thing was lightning fast, orders of magnitude faster at building projects than Microsoft's compilers.</description>

      <title>The Death of Hype: What's Next for Scala</title>
      <link>http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/TheDeathofHypeWhatsNextforScala.html</link>
      <description>A recent tweet by a friend of mine noted how the public interest in the Scala programming language seems to have plateaued or waned, which matches my feeling of the latest trends and zeitgeist. This blog post will go into why I think that has happened, where Scala stands now, and what the future holds for the Scala community.</description>
