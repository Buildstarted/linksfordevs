      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7Q-OeWKBew</link>
      <description>This is episode 5 of C# with CSharpFritz. Jeff introduces arrays, collections, generics and starts talking about LINQ in this beginner-friendly 'talk radio style' episode.

Interactive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020

After the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13

Questions:
00:20:17 - What's the fastest way of initializing an array with the same value?
00:32:13 - What type are collection elements when you reference them using var?
00:35:51 - Is there an "Add" method for a Queue?
00:42:18 - What is difference between Stack and Queue?
00:43:46 - Can you pick any element from a Queue or Stack? For example from the middle?
00:46:05 - Can you foreach (enumerate) over a Stack?
00:48:20 - Can you peek into the n-Item of a Stack or Queue?
01:11:30 - How is a Dictionary different than the prior example with the file extensions?
01:15:22 - Is it possible to make a generic object with type Object?
01:39:21 - With LINQ, do you prefer two Where clauses or &amp;&amp;?

      <title>Indy Xamarin User Group - The Best Way to Architect Your Xamarin.Forms App</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW_aGvSQ5oQ</link>
      <description>The title of this talk is a lie. There is no one single way to architect an app. If the app works well, is robust for future expansion, and maintainable - it's architected just fine.

You can mess things up though. And then everything is terrible.

So, tune in to this talk to find out about some ways you can go about architecting your Xamarin.Forms app so you don't hate yourself before development of the app is complete.

      <description>With the job hunting season well under way, I thought I would give a list of tips, tricks, and guiding principles I’ve learned from hunting both this season and seasons past. Most of this advice centers around finding a Product or SWE job, but I’m sure some of it applies to other industries as well.

      <description>Andrew Lock joins us to talk about testing.  We started out by talking about should you test API/MVC controllers?  The discussion then turned into test for messaging, databases, and much more.

Should you unit-test API/MVC controllers in ASP.NET Core?

      <description>Firefox usage is down 85% despite Mozilla's top exec pay going up 400% Mozilla recently announced that they would be dismissing 250 people. That's a quarter of their workforce so there are some deep cuts to their work too. The victims include: the MDN docs (those are the web standards docs everyone likes better than w3schools), the Rust compiler and even some cuts to Firefox development. Like </description>

      <description>I've been trying to make our house and specifically the yard have more of a resort/getaway location feel during this current pandemic situation and the lockdowns that have been in place. Setting up the hot tub area to feel like somewhere else has been on top of the priority list. I've already added some bamboo screening so the next logical step was to add some tiki lights.</description>

      <title>Nate Rose - Innovating on OUR STEM Education [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2eg2L4eCII</link>
      <description>What is an IQ? Why do we take the SATs? How did it end up even being a metric of childhood success? Senior Software Engineer walks through 100 years of modern education and how it has been systematically flawed for underrepresented communities. NSBE Jr. Bay Area takes on this challenge by innovating outside of the parameters of the education system.

My talk challenges the status quo of common core, standardized tests and looks to technologists, innovators and entrepreneurs as a call to action to remodel education for people of color.

Nate Rose is a Senior Software Engineer with a background in DevOps, Data Engineering, and Distributed Cloud Infrastructure Systems. Outside of engineering at Ripple, he does research in neurotechnology, casually overfits ML models and works with building education equity through non-profits like AI4ALL and NSBE.

      <title>deWiTTERS Game Loop – deWiTTERS</title>
      <link>https://dewitters.com/dewitters-gameloop/</link>
      <description>The game loop is the heartbeat of every game, no 		  game can run without it. But unfortunately for every 		  new game programmer, there aren’t any good articles 		  on the internet who provide the proper information 		  on this topic. But fear not, because you have just 		  stumbled upon the one and only article that gives 		  the game loop the attention it deserves.  Thanks to my job as a game programmer, I come into 		  contact with a lot of code for small mobile 		  games. And it always amazes me how many game loop 		  implementations are out there. You might wonder 		  yourself how a simple thing like that can be written 		  in different ways. Well, it can, and I will discuss 		  the pros and cons of the most popular 		  implementations, and give you the (in my opinion) 		  best solution of implementing a game loop.</description>

      <title>Why We Upgraded Our Production Application to .NET 5.0</title>
      <link>https://exceptionless.com/why-we-upgraded-our-production-application-to-net-5-0/</link>
      <description>For anyone who has built an application, you’ve probably built it on some library or framework that changes over time. To keep up, you have to upgrade your application. However, there are varying schools of thought around when you should upgrade. At Exceptionless, we like to be on the bleeding edge.

      <title>Shukri Abdullahi - Through Programming I Became a Better Artist [w/ASL Interpreting]</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqxf-shA0UQ</link>
      <description>Code is my new favorite artistic medium. Creating art was once the only activity that put me in a flow state that was until I started coding. Programming like art is full of processes, speed bumps, errors, eustress, and joy. My skills as an artist have proven to be an asset in programming. While programming has cultivated artistic improvements.

What: More artists should learn to code.
Why: You’re skills as an artist are an asset in the programming world and vice versa programming can cultivate artistic improvements.
How: Personal Anecdote detailing skills.

      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20200924-00/?p=104275</link>
