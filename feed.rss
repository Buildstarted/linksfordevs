      <link>https://vertette.github.io/post/funfactoruplink</link>
      <description>Remember family computers? Before we had tablets, middle class families would buy overpriced computers from dodgy computer stores that the whole family got to share. As they were mostly used by children and adults who didn&amp;#39;t have the slightest understanding of technology, it didn&amp;#39;t take long for the family computer to down to a crawl, plagued by dodgy Kazaa downloads and suspicious Internet Explorer toolbars. Between a lack of money to buy a better computer, no easy way to buy digital games in Europe for the longest time and no nearby stores that sold computer games, it took until my brother moved out of the home before I really started getting into PC gaming.</description>

      <description>…if you’re an Emacs user, that is.
You know, it’s funny, because people have opinions on why you don’t need a terminal on entirely different ends of a spectrum. It’s like that IQ chart meme:
And yes, I know, there are many people who will disagree with me, probably on everything that I’m going to say next.</description>

      <title>Self-Signed locally trusted certificates with cert-manager</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2023/10/25/self-signed-locally-trusted-certificates-with-cert-manager/</link>
      <description>Self-Signed locally trusted certificates with cert-manager We are going to discuss how to set up a Kubernetes environment where components can run using HTTPS without pain.
Premise Usually, people either generate certificates outside the cluster using either openssl, or mkcert, then mount them in or use those as seeds for further generation. This poses a number of problems during testing and distribution of these certificates. And then, switching to production, it proves that local certs will either no longer work or pose even more problems in getting them properly distributed again.</description>

      <link>https://cyrilzakka.github.io/llm-playbook/nested/rot-pos-embed.html</link>
      <description>Rotary Positional Embeddings aim to overcome limitations tied to both fixed and learned positional embeddings. While fixed sinusoidal embeddings are generalizable to arbitrary sequence lengths in practice, models have been found to underperform when encountering sequences with lengths substantially different from their training data in practice. Enter rotary positional embeddings.</description>
