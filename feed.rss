      <title>Researchers use tiny magnetic swirls to generate true random numbers</title>
      <link>https://phys.org/news/2022-02-tiny-magnetic-swirls-true-random.html</link>
      <description>Whether for use in cybersecurity, gaming or scientific simulation, the world needs true random numbers, but generating them is harder than one might think. But a group of Brown University physicists has developed a technique that can potentially generate millions of random digits per second by harnessing the behavior of skyrmions—tiny magnetic anomalies that arise in certain two-dimensional materials.</description>

In so doing, a new adjacent chunk of free space is created at the end of the logical RAID-Z group and thus at the end of each physical […]</description>

      <description>Any password policy, even with strict rules, can be easily bypassed with simple tricks: Passw0rd!, Passw0rd$, Password!1 can be all valid passwords for length and complexity.
It this common scenario it’s useful to regularly audit Active Directory passwords against password dictionaries (like RockYou) and/or HaveIBeenPwned.</description>

      <title>Dolphin Progress Report: November and December 2021, January 2022</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/02/08/dolphin-progress-report-nov-and-dec-2021-jan-2022/</link>
      <description>This year, we&amp;#39;ve hit an important milestone that&amp;#39;s been in the works for nearly a decade. In late 2012, Sonicadvance1 began work on Dolphin&amp;#39;s ARM JIT. Back then, there weren&amp;#39;t any devices that had even a sliver of hope of running Dolphin close to full speed, but that wasn&amp;#39;t really the goal. All he wanted to do was see if it could be done; it sounded like a fun, challenging project. However, as time passed the idea turned into more than just a passing curiosity. Users were more than happy to donate to cover the hardware cost of staying on the bleeding edge of a rapidly evolving ecosystem, allowing ARM development to flourish. By 2015, Sonicadvance1 astounded developers and the community alike with footage of Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&amp;#39;s time trial mode running close to full speed.
On that note, we&amp;#39;re happy to announce that Dolphin&amp;#39;s AArch64 JIT has finally reached feature parity with Dolphin&amp;#39;s x86-64 JIT. This means that every PowerPC instruction that the x86-64 JIT supports along with every major JIT feature are now supported in the AArch64 JIT! And this is a great time for ARM in general, with each generation of processor pushing the boundaries and companies like Apple adopting the architecture for larger and higher power devices like their M1 Mac line. For those on mobile phones and tablets, Adreno powered devices provide decent enough graphics drivers to get a reasonable experience at this point. And with a critical bottleneck getting fixed just days ago, performance on Adreno GPUs has skyrocketed. You won&amp;#39;t have to scroll far for that news, we promise.
But that&amp;#39;s only the tip of the iceberg; we&amp;#39;ve had three months worth of changes pile up and some other important infrastructure news. We&amp;#39;ve improved the user experience on macOS significantly and restored support for older devices. In fact, enough has happened that we&amp;#39;ll be detailing the status of Dolphin&amp;#39;s macOS support near the end of the report.
And... we haven&amp;#39;t even talked about any emulation fixes yet. The past three months have had tons of changes that would have normally been the highlight of a Progress Report. The three month gap between reports was not because of a lack of changes. Want to take Riivolution games on netplay? You can. Hate the EA VP6 bugs? Make them a thing of the past with a new option. Wish your favorite LogicOp game worked on GLES or MoltenVK? Odds are, it does now! The list goes on, but outlining everything would take way too long, so let&amp;#39;s just dive in. Please enjoy the November, December, and January Progress Report!</description>

      <title>BastionZero Blog | In which I agree with the federal gov&amp;#39;t  and bash VPNs for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://www.bastionzero.com/blog/bashing-vpns-for-fun-and-profit</link>
      <description>When I first read the federal government’s memo on it’s “transition zero trust”, I was jumping out of my skin with excitement. There’s lots of great stuff in that memo (see my earlier blog post) but what excited me most was the memo’s stance on VPNs.</description>

      <title>Why I wanted to be a developer</title>
      <link>http://www.adambourg.com/programming/why/developer/2022/02/08/why_i_wanted_to_be_a_developer.html</link>
      <description>I started programming when I was 13 years old. I stole my brothers HTML and Javascript book and built some simple web forms.
