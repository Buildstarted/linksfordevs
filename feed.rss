      <description>Somewhat recently I have done a small amount of “adding knowledge into the world.” After a few months of building the business it became apparent that many of the problems I was facing had very few corresponding resources. These are niche problems solved by niche people. It turns out that</description>

      <title>Junior Developers Can Lead Too! - Principal Software Engineering Manager AMA</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=rjBlMGjE5Is</link>
      <description>I&amp;#39;m only a junior -- is there any way I can demonstrate leadership skills?

This is a question I received on my Discord community, and I think it&amp;#39;s a great one.

Too often we associate things like leadership with titles, such as manager. But the reality is leadership is not a role or a title, it&amp;#39;s action that you can take.

Let&amp;#39;s see how leadership can show up regardless of your level as I discuss which things I&amp;#39;d recommend focusing on.

As with all livestreams, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to answering YOUR questions! So join me live and ask in the chat, or you can comment now and I can try to get it answered while I stream.

      <title>How decentralized is Bluesky really? -- Dustycloud Brainstorms</title>
      <link>https://dustycloud.org/blog/how-decentralized-is-bluesky/</link>
      <description>Recently due to various events (namely a lot of people getting off of
X-Twitter), Bluesky has become a lot more
popular, and excitement for its underlying protocol,
ATProto, is growing.
Since I worked on
ActivityPub which connects
together Mastodon,
Sharkey,
Peertube,
GotoSocial, etc, etc, etc in the present-day
fediverse, I often get asked whether or not I have opinions about
ATProto vs ActivityPub, and the answer is that I do have opinions, but
I am usually head-down focused on building what I hope to be the
next generation of decentralized (social) networking tech,
and so I keep to myself about such things except in private channels.</description>
