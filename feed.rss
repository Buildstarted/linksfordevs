      <title>Organ transplant patients (maybe) don’t get dementia. Here’s why. – Trevor Klee</title>
      <link>https://trevorklee.com/organ-transplant-patients-maybe-dont-get-dementia-heres-why/</link>
      <description>When I was in college, I applied for an internship at the Huffington Post, that venerable bastion of journalism. Before my interview, I was given a spreadsheet of articles and associated view counts. I was asked to formulate and present a hypothesis about which types of articles generate the most views.</description>

      <title>Dapr joins CNCF as an incubating project</title>
      <link>https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/11/03/dapr-joins-cncf-as-an-incubating-project/</link>
      <description>We’re happy to announce that this week, Dapr joined the CNCF as an incubating project. Ever since its initial launch, the Dapr project has made its intention clear that the project is eventually to be donated to a vendor-neutral foundation. The project recently formed a steering and technical committee that re-enforces our commitment to vendor neutrality by ensuring balanced representation in the committee across vendors.
The CNCF houses many projects with which Dapr integrates closely.</description>

      <title>A capturing lambda can be a coroutine, but you have to save your captures while you still can</title>
      <link>https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20211103-00/?p=105870</link>
      <description>We saw some time ago that capturing lambdas which are coroutines result in lifetime issues because the lambda itself returns at the first suspension point, at which point there’s a good chance it will be destructed. After that point, any attempt by the lambda body to access those captured variables is a use-after-free bug.</description>

      <description>It’s not every day that you get to debug what may well be a packet of death. It was certainly the first time for me.
What do I mean by “a packet of death”? A software bug where the network stack crashes in reaction to a single received network packet, taking down the whole operating system with it.</description>
