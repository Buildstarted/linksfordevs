      <title>How I Spent 2 Days Chasing a Bug that Didn't Exist</title>

      <description>&lt;p class="text-sm preview"&gt;Post-&lt;a class="underline" href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WWDC2020&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to rewrite the backend of txtodo in SwiftUI using the new &lt;a class="underline" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10037/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;App and Scene structure&lt;/a&gt;. Rebuilding the app from scratch may have not been the best choice, but during that process I have massively simplified the app's data structure, despaghettified some messy UI code, and spent two full days trying to solve a problem that didn't exist. This is the story of that last bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
