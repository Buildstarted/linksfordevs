      <title>Fireworks: Sugar Stars</title>
      <link>https://wybiral.github.io/fireworks/comps/sugar_stars.html</link>
      <description>Here's a collection of firework star recipes using common sugar
                (sucrose) as the fuel source. This approach is impractical for
                commercial pyrotechnics due to being so sensetive to moisture
                and heat. But for homemade fireworks it has several advantages.
                It doubles as a binder and is water soluble so there's no need
                for noxious solvents. It's also widely available and cheap.</description>

      <title>Great CRO Tool or Privacy Nightmare – SystemTrap</title>
      <link>https://systemtrap.org/503</link>
      <description>The past few years have seen many different SaaS apps pop up and appeal to businesses. From CDPs to AI, to session replay, there have been many different advanced platforms marketers can add to their toolbelts. One of my personal favorite tools over the past few years has been FullStory. FullStory is a session replay web app that allows site owners to literally watch what a user does on their website – in full video. Previously martech folks were stuck with heat mapping software like Kissmetrics and HotJar – and even to a lesser extent Google Analytics. While these tools were certainly helpful in addressing which parts of a web page were clicked on or interacted with the most, they were static interpretations of the data.</description>

      <title>Historical programming-language groups disappearing from Google</title>
      <link>https://lwn.net/Articles/827233/</link>
      <description>As Alex McDonald notes in this
support request, Google has recently banned the old Usenet groups
comp.lang.forth and comp.lang.lisp from the Google Groups system.
"Of specific concern is the archive. These are some of the oldest
groups on Usenet, and the depth &amp; breadth of the historical material that
has just disappeared from the internet, on two seminal programming
languages, is huge and highly damaging. These are the history and
collective memories of two communities that are being expunged, and it's
not great, since there is no other comprehensive archive after Google's
purchase of Dejanews around 20 years ago."
Perhaps Google can be convinced to restore the content, but it also seems
that some of this material could benefit from a more stable archive.</description>

      <title>Expanding Beyond 64kb of Memory with Bank Switching (16-Bit VM in JavaScript 012)</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=araYkE3KAms</link>
      <description>In this episode we're learning about memory bank switching - a technique common in the retro game console days - that allows us to address more memory than the limited address space that 16 bits provides!

=[ ℹ About ℹ ]=


This series is all about building a powerful virtual machine in JavaScript with the following features:

- A flexible, extensible, register-based virtual machine
- Support for signed, unsigned and floating point operations
- A call stack 
- Interrupt capabilities
- Ability to do memory mapping for IO
- An assembly language with macro and module support
- A higher level, C like language. We'll use and expand the library from the parser combinators from scratch series
- And finally, to be able to take the whole thing into the browser and extend it to create a sort of fantasy console - an emulator for a machine that never existed

      <title>Migrating a 40TB SQL Server Database</title>
      <link>https://www.tarynpivots.com/post/migrating-40tb-sql-server-database/</link>
      <description>Initially, I wasn’t sure whether to write about this migration project, but when I randomly asked if people would be interested, the response was overwhelming. This was a long, kind of boring, very repetitive, and at times incredibly frustrating project, but I learned a lot, and maybe someone else will learn from this too. There may be far better ways to move this amount of data. In the path I went down, there was a huge amount of juggling that had to take place (I’ll explain that later).</description>

      <description>It’s easier to manage 4 people than it is to manage one person. The primary reason for this is the inherent over-reliance in the relationship between a manager and a single report. Let’s dive deeper.</description>

      <description>The 
    NY Times profile quotes me saying
    “We don’t really have an Amazon problem. What we have is a deep, societal problem with an unacceptable imbalance of
    power and wealth.”
    But the URL contained the string “amazon-critic-tim-bray”
    and the HTML &lt;title&gt; says “Tim Bray Is Not Done With Amazon”.
    I feel like I’m being pigeonholed and I don’t like it.</description>

      <link>https://drewdevault.com/2020/07/27/Anti-AGPL-propaganda.html</link>
      <description>Google is well-known for forbidding the use of software using the GNU Affero General Public License, commonly known as “AGPL”. Google is also well-known for being the subject of cargo-culting by fad startups. Unfortunately, this means that they are susceptible to what is ultimately anti-AGPL propaganda from Google, with little to no basis in fact.</description>
