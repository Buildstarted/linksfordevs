    "Timestamp": "2024-05-16T08:00:56",
    "Domain": "jepsen.io",
    "Description": "Datomic is a temporal Entity-Attribute-Value OLTP database which supports non-interactive transactions on top of pluggable storage engines. It offers a variety of query mechanisms across thick and thin clients, including Datalog, graph traversal, and an ODM-style API. We evaluated Datomic Pro 1.0.7075 and found its inter-transaction safety properties appear stronger than claimed. Not only was every history Serializable, but sessions bound to a single peer appear Strong Session Serializable, and histories restricted to write transactions and reads using d/sync appear Strong Serializable. However, inside of a transaction Datomic behaves as if operations were evaluated concurrently. Depending on how one interprets those operations, this might violate three of the most widely accepted formalizations of Serializability, each of which specify serial intra-transaction semantics. It also creates the potential for invariant violations when composing transaction functions. Datomic has published a companion blog post alongside this report. This work was funded by Nubank (Nu Pagamentos S.A), and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy."
