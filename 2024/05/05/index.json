Even if they don't end up arguing, the typical outcome of a prioritization exercise is a pile of tasks assigned to a particular bucket like P0, P1, P2 or P3 ‚Äî corresponding to Critical, High, Medium and Low priority. Usually, this will yield enough confidence to feel satisfied and to believe that the job is done and everything is clear. But before long, it'll be clear that nothing is clear at all. Why is that?"
