Among other uses, they're popular for TLV formats such as Protocol Buffers, which contain lots of small numbers (tags) and have a design goal of space efficiency. The two encodings with near-universal adoption are VLQ and LEB128, which are the big- and little-endian dialects of an encoding originally developed in the early 1980s[0]."
