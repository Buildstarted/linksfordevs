    "Description": "In this blog post, we take a look at the ECMAScript 2025 feature “Duplicate named capturing groups” which was proposed by Kevin Gibbons. It’s a feature for regular expressions that enables us to use the same capture group name more than once. The only restriction is that duplicates must exist in different alternatives – in other words: At any time, there can’t be more than one capture with a given name. Why is that useful? It lets us reuse regular expression fragments and match-processing code between alternatives."
