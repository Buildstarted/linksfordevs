    "Description": "In this project, I analyzed and reverse engineered the firmware,\n        file formats and custom cryptography of a business IP phone. As it\n        turns out, many of the phone’s software components are customized,\n        which made this a very interesting and insightful project. Finally, I\n        wrote tools to craft my own update images, in order to install\n        arbitrary software on the phone."
