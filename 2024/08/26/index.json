    "Description": "For five years, I've dedicated most of my side-project time to making apps and tools using the Solid Protocol. Many share its vision, but it's also common to hear criticisms. I'm often asked why I'm still working on Solid, or told about another project that is doing a better job at solving similar problems.\nToday, I'll go through some of the criticisms, share my own concerns, and answer why after all these years I'm still choosing Solid.\n\n\n\n"
