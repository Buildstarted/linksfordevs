You see for Postgres itself stability and reliability is core. So where does the new stuff come from if it’s not in the stable core… extensions.\nExtensions within Postgres are unlike most other databases allowing you to modify or well extend the standard Postgres behavior. You can build other storage backends, new types, etc. Postgres itself ships with a number of extensions within the “contrib”. The list of contrib extensions hasn’t changed any time recently, but even contrib is a small sampling of what is possible. Beyond core there is a whole world of extensions, I want dig into just a smalls sampling starting with a few in core…"

As I’ve mentioned before, I’m not a fan of DHH, but I agree with his takes on this situation. On October 13, DHH commented on the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) hijacking. Mullenweg then responded but deleted the post. Mullenweg put a new post up at the same URL which offered a modicum of contrition, but was still doubling down on his actions. DHH then responded with a thoughtful rebuke that didn’t mention Mullenweg at all."
