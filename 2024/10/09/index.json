Design goals are useful because they give everyone making product decisions a common language and set of priorities to appeal to. If done well, they would accumulate the design wisdom of Rust into a concise package and assist RFC authors outside the Rust teams themselves.\nLast month, in the two days before RustConf, the Lang team held a meetup where I presented a draft set of design goals."
