    "Description": "How does software contribute to military accidents? The stakes are high. During the Cold War, computerized early warning systems produced “near-miss” nuclear crises. In the future, military AI applications could fail with devastating consequences. To illuminate the causes of military accidents, existing studies apply “normal accidents” and “high reliability organizations” theories. While these frameworks are helpful, they neglect the military’s system acquisition process, which often outsources software development to contractors and limits input from military end-users. By contrast, the software development lifecycle theory expands the causal timeline of accidents beyond decisions made on the battlefield to those made decades earlier in software design, serving as an antecedent account of how software contributes to military accidents. Illuminating dynamics overlooked by the two dominant approaches, this theory is supported by four cases: the 1988 USS Vincennes shootdown of an Iranian airliner; the 2003 Patriot fratricides; the 2017 USS McCain collision; and software upgrades in the 2021 Kabul airlift."

    "Description": "Have you ever wondered if what you see in “real life” truly represents the reality of our physical universe? We’ve grown so accustomed to certain aspects of our perception that any deviation would immediately signal that something is off. Think about the glitching cat in The Matrix or imagine if your life suddenly unfolded at 30 frames per second — as if lit by a strobe light on a dance floor. How do we know we’re not already inside the world’s most immersive video?"

However, data alone isn’t the answer; it’s the enabler to create momentum on a business & technology flywheel: a model where data drives decisions, decisions drive actions, and those actions drive value, propelling the business forward in a self-reinforcing cycle.\nIn a previous post, I used a model to explain how data could cross the borders of applications and domains to bring increasing value at the organizational level."
