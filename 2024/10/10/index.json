    "Description": "Hi! You may have seen that Weird Gloop is now hosting the official League of Legends Wiki. We’ve spent the last couple months working with the Riot folks and the League wiki editors to move it off of Fandom, and turn it into something the players will (hopefully!) really dig. I also love that it got started because one of the Riot guys plays a ton of Old School RuneScape and thinks our wiki is awesome. How cool is that?? I want this to kick off a new era where communities and developers take control from Fandom, and make some really great wikis. We’ve already been doing a bit of this, starting when we helped the Minecraft Wiki leave Fandom, but I think it’s time for me (and the rest of our group) to be more explicit about what we want to do."
