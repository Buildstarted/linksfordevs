    "Description": "DateTime, DateTimeOffset, and... well, ANYTHING with dates, times, and time zones can be a huge pain in the butt in DotNet.\n\nDateTimeOffset has made some of this stuff feel much better in our applications because it can carry around with it the time zone offset along with the DateTime itself. Awesome!\n\nBut have you found in your applications that you're writing UTC DateTimes to databases and then reading those DateTimes back?\n\nIf you're not careful, you'll lose the implicit UTC time zone information. But there's a handy trick we can use with Dapper as we'll see in this tutorial!\n\n----\nüîë Membership & Subscriptions:\n- üì® Weekly Newsletter: https://subscribe.devleader.ca\n- üèòÔ∏è Private Discord Community: https://discord.com/invite/TVY79BZ3Wy\n- üìΩÔ∏è YouTube Membership: https://www.youtube.com/@DevLeader/join\n\nüß† Courses:\n- All Courses: https://www.devleader.ca/courses\n- Nailing The Behavioral Interview: https://dometrain.com/course/career-nailing-the-behavioral-interview/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Getting Started with C#: https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-csharp?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Deep dive C#: https://dometrain.com/course/deep-dive-csharp?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- C# Zero to Hero BUNDLE: https://dometrain.com/bundle/from-zero-to-hero-csharp/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Reflection in .NET: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-reflection-in-dotnet/?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- Refactoring For C# Devs: https://dometrain.com/course/from-zero-to-hero-refactoring-for-csharp-developers?affcode=1115529_nl-teyzg\n- [FREE] Intro to Software Development: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzATctVhnsggb3lj53T8fJSK6LJQFUyKS\n\nüó£Ô∏è Social Media & Links:\n- All My Links: https://linktr.ee/devleader\n- Vlogs:  @DevLeaderBTS @CodeCommute \n- Blog: https://www.devleader.ca/\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@devleader\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickcosentino\n- Threads: https://threads.net/@dev.leader\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/DevLeaderCa\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DevLeaderCa\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dev.leader\n- GitHub: https://github.com/ncosentino/\n- Twitch: https://twitch.tv/devleaderca\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@DevLeader?sub_confirmation=1\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è Affiliations & Products/Services That I Love:\n- @BrandGhostAI for all of my content creation: https://brandghost.ai\n- AI shorts helper Opus Clip: https://opus.pro/?via=2f9e97\n- VPS hosting from RackNerd: https://my.racknerd.com/aff.php?aff=9013\n- VPS hosting from Contabo: https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-101028632-12454592\n- Newsletter platform ConvertKit: https://convertkit.com/?lmref=c5X7KQ\n- Newsletter referral system SparkLoop: https://dash.sparkloop.app/signup?aff=9fe76c8b\n----\n\n#softwareengineering #softwaredeveloper #softwareengineer"
