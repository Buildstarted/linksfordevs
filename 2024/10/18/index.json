    "Description": "With MassTransit v8.3.0, it is now possible to configure the ReplyTo endpoint using RabbitMQ.\n\nRabbitMQ provides a default ReplyTo address for every broker connection that can be used to send messages directly to the connection without the need to create a temporary queue. Using the new request client, the bus endpoint is no longer used/needed and MassTransit will send responses using the connection's ReplyTo address.\n\nMassTransit \nDocumentation: https://masstransit.io/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/rNpQgYn\n\nConnect on Twitter (X):\nhttps://twitter.com/phatboyg"
