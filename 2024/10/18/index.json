    "Description": "C has the CHAR_BIT macro which contains the implementation-defined number of bits in a byte, without restrictions on the value of this number. C++ imports this macro as-is. Many other macros and character traits have values derived from CHAR_BIT. While this was historically relevant in computing‚Äôs early days, modern hardware has overwhelmingly converged on the assumption that a byte is 8 bits. This document proposes that C++ formally mandates that a byte is 8 bits."
