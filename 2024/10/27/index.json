    "Domain": "zwclose.github.io",
    "Description": "I discovered multiple vulnerabilities in RtsPer.sys, an SD card reader driver developed by Realtek. These vulnerabilities enable non-privileged users to leak the contents of kernel pool and kernel stack, write to arbitrary kernel memory, and, the most interesting, read and write physical memory from user mode via the DMA capability of the device. The vulnerabilities have remained undisclosed for years, affecting many OEMs, including Dell, Lenovo, and others. If your laptop is equipped with an SD card reader, it is highly likely to be manufactured by Realtek, making it susceptible to these vulnerabilities as well."

There’s a lot of hustle culture out there that promises to get you there right away; while a few folks out there get lucky, most of this is just concealing the outside-the-office time its purporters are plugging in. In hopes of making this wide range of possibilities a little easier to navigate (and with the wish that I could give myself this same resource some twenty years ago), here’s a breakdown of some common and reliable actual paths towards career satisfaction, particularly for those that are young and hungry:"

The idea is that maintaining strong, unique passwords via a password manager is easier for users to understand.\nThis completely misses the key point about why passkeys are such a stronger way of protecting login, though, so I decided to spend some time to compare the two approaches."

We chose SpiceDB to handle advanced use cases like organizational hierarchies and temporary access. However, while solving many technical challenges, it also opened up new security risks, particularly around ensuring consistent and reliable enforcement of authorization decisions across applications."
