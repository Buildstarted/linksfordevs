We explore the evolution of data encoding formats from NRZI (Non-Return to Zero Inverted) to PE (Phase Encoding), GCR (Group Coded Recording), MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation), and RLL (Run Length Limited). By the end of this video, that alphabet soup of acronyms will make perfect sense!\n\nJoin me as we unravel the challenges of storing digital data on magnetic media and how ingenious encoding schemes have overcome these hurdles.
