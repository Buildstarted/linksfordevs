    "Description": "For a long time, we have been living in a world where we use default approaches without fully thinking about their purpose. Take WordPress as an example: it's a powerful application, but it requires MySQL as its database, and to make it fast, you often need Memcache to cache MySQL queries and reduce database load. Alongside, there's the WYSIWYG editor, which, in theory, allows users to edit HTML easily, but in practice often generates unreadable, bloated code."

It is not a realization of\n      resignation, but rather of liberation.\n      For if the mind can be ordered, if it           can be made still in the midst of this\n      restless life, then we have already\n      discovered the key to a deeper kind of\n      freedom."
