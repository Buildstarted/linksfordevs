In this video, I dive into what it's like navigating a relationship when you think differently, and how misunderstandings and frustrations are part of daily life. I'll share some insights into mindblindness, the constant mental gymnastics of understanding neurotypical behavior, and why communication can feel like a real-life sitcom.\n\nWhether you're curious about autism or just enjoy hearing stories from real life, this episode of Dave’s Garage has something for you.

As a neurodiverse person, I have had to work hard to appear to do things effortlessly. Networking is one of the skills I have learned from trial and error, and I want to teach you how to navigate new environments and converse with all kinds of people. If you've tried learning from movies and self-help books and that hasn't worked, there's a reason. There's a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. If you want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it's still hard to find people to talk to and start a conversation. I'll give you real tips that will help you work through these issues.\n\nWesley Faulkner is a first-generation American. He is a founding member of the government transparency group Open Austin and ran for Austin City Council in 2016. His professional experience also includes work as a social media and community manager for the software company Atlassian, and various roles for the computer processor company AMD, Dell, and IBM. Wesley Faulkner serves as a board member for South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) and specializes in Developer Relations."

See the results live!  Check out my book on the autism spectrum!  https://amzn.to/4elzfQv\n\nI’m doing something that’s never been done before: we’re going to run a ChatGPT-style large language model locally on a wide range of hardware, from a $50 Raspberry Pi 4 all the way up to a $50,000 Dell AI workstation with dual Nvidia 6000 Ada cards.\n\nIf you saw my last video, you know I caught some heat for using top-tier hardware and running everything in WSL on Windows. This time, I’m doing things differently. We’re starting small and budget-friendly—no Linux shenanigans—and testing out local inference on everything from a Pi to a high-performance mini PC, a gaming rig, an M2 Mac Pro, and, of course, that beast of a Dell workstation.  \n\nAlong the way, I’ll show you how to install Ollama on Windows, and we’ll compare how well each machine can handle models like Llama 3.1 and even the monstrous 405-billion parameter model. Which system will shine? Which one will falter? Can a Raspberry Pi even handle a large language model at all? And what happens when we push the $50,000 workstation to its limit?\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what it takes to run a large language model locally, or just want to see how different hardware stacks up, this episode is for you! Be sure to stick around to the end for some surprising results.\n\n💻 Hardware tested in this episode:\n\nRaspberry Pi 4 (8GB RAM)\nOrion Herk Mini PC (Ryzen 9 7940HS)\nDesktop Gaming PC (Threadripper 3970X & Nvidia 4080)\nApple M2 Mac Pro\nDell Threadripper Workstation (96 cores & Nvidia 6000 Ada)\n\nCheck out Dave’s Attic for behind-the-scenes Q&A on episodes like this one.!\nHTTP://youtube.com/@UCtb6a_CnmGbSns9G8W2Ny0w \n\nFollow me on Facebook for daily updates!\nHTTP://fb.com/davepl\nTwitter: @davepl1968davepl1968"
