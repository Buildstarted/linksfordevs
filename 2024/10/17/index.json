    "Description": "Dive into the incredible story of Stuxnet, the world's first cyberweapon, and its complex attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. From its discovery by a small Belarusian security firm to its use of multiple zero-day vulnerabilities and legitimate digital certificates, Stuxnet was a masterpiece of malware engineering. We’ll explore how it used USB drives and autorun functionality ( a component I was once responsible for) to cross air gaps and manipulate Siemens PLCs controlling uranium enrichment centrifuges. Join me as we break down Stuxnet's design, its devastating payload, and the global response that followed.\n\nIf you're into tech history, retro computing, or just curious about how cyberwarfare can impact the real world, be sure to subscribe and hit the notification bell!
