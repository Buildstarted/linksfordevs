At Tromero, we've developed a novel three-step data improvement process that can yield a remarkable 18% boost in LLM performance on the Alpaca dataset. This approach empowers even smaller models to critique and refine the outputs of their larger counterparts, paving the way for significant enhancements in overall model output quality."

Oncologists practice the fine art of killing the cancer without entirely killing the patient. But the balancing act isn’t always successful.\nSuppose the earth were semi-sentient, and had some vague billion-year-long evolutionary memory that suggested a looming apocalyptic danger.\nImagine that humans are a kind of inflammatory immune response, a form of self-administered chemotherapy: physics-wielding primates designed to avert the worst life-ending crisis (think: using nuclear weapons to divert a major asteroid impact), at the cost of a mass extinction, climate destabalization, and irreversible global pollution."
