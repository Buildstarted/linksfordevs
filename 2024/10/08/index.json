However, people in certain distressed states sometimes inadvertently hurt others or themselves. Even by detailing a horrific and traumatic event one can re-traumatize other people who went through similar experiences. This problem is especially salient for direct messages, where there are no moderators to intervene–we can only rely on users’ reporting after the harm is dealt. How do we protect users from harm? Hence I set out to solve the message moderation problem with AI."
