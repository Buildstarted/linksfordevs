    "Description": "Today’s websites and apps are built to compensate for an absence of trust, rather than to support its growth. Customers and companies both understand that human handshakes no longer scale in the digital age, and surrender to their replacement by a tap of the finger on a button labeled I accept. While every handshake comes with an expectation of honesty, this button never did: we know we are lying the moment we touch it, as does the author of the legalese no one expects anyone to read. Navigating a trustless world is a heavy price to pay for the boundless freedoms of the World Wide Web—except it doesn’t have to be like this. Although trust remains an inherently human relationship, machines can help us build and evolve our relationships by handling the fiddly bits on our behalf. This liberates people to refocus on gaining mutual value from our relationships, without the huge burden of their setup and maintenance. Everything starts with the realization that data technology is fundamentally trust technology, and thus a transversal layer within any ecosystem rather than just the icing on the cake."

    "Description": "When an electronic device refuses to power up, it can be frustrating for anyone, but for someone with a bit of electronics knowledge, it becomes a challenge to solve. The issue could be as simple as a faulty capacitor or as complex as a damaged integrated circuit (IC). This guide provides an in-depth, step-by-step approach for debugging a device at the board level. We’ll walk you through checking key components such as capacitors, transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits (ICs), explaining what each does, how to test them, and how to interpret the results. By the end, you should have a clear process for diagnosing and potentially fixing a dead device."

    "Description": "In a world where data management is becoming increasingly complex, companies must ensure the reliability of their information. A large portion of CRMs and databases contain outdated or incorrect data, complicating entity resolution (also known as data matching, data linkage, or record linkage), making data enrichment and updating difficult. This can not only introduce new errors but also directly impact strategic business decisions."
