    "Description": "I’ve spent the past several years working with functional programming languages\nin my free time – primarily Haskell and OCaml. I love both languages but also\nfind aspects of each frustrating.\nHaskell is terse and elegant with type classes providing a powerful mechanism\nfor ad-hoc polymorphism. However, it can also be confusingly implicit and I\npersonally find lazy evaluation to have more downsides than upsides.\nOCaml is explicit and powerful with a best-in-class module system. However, I\nbelieve it is often exhaustingly explicit, especially when dealing with custom\ndata types in generic containers."

    "Description": "It's hard to imagine now, but in the 2000s web browsers were quite\nboring and didn't get updated very often. IE7 being released was a huge\ndeal (indeed, Microsoft kept to a slower-moving schedule just as the\nrest of the industry was starting to pick up the pace). Opera was a\nviable fully-independent alternative. This all changed with the rise\nof the idea of a \"Living Standard\" (that is to say, a non-standard\nof endless layers of constantly-changing complexity for web technology),\nand more particularly Google Chrome, which adopted a rapid-release\nmodel right as its authors started having more influence on standards\ncommittees."

Five years ago, building apps, websites, or games required a non-trivial amount of skill, and getting your first project off the ground was an accomplishment. Now, AI can generate most starter projects in hours, if not minutes. I think this decimates the reward, both internal and external, of actually completing the first few projects."
