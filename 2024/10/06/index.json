    "Description": "It's hard to imagine now, but in the 2000s web browsers were quite\nboring and didn't get updated very often. IE7 being released was a huge\ndeal (indeed, Microsoft kept to a slower-moving schedule just as the\nrest of the industry was starting to pick up the pace). Opera was a\nviable fully-independent alternative. This all changed with the rise\nof the idea of a \"Living Standard\" (that is to say, a non-standard\nof endless layers of constantly-changing complexity for web technology),\nand more particularly Google Chrome, which adopted a rapid-release\nmodel right as its authors started having more influence on standards\ncommittees."

Five years ago, building apps, websites, or games required a non-trivial amount of skill, and getting your first project off the ground was an accomplishment. Now, AI can generate most starter projects in hours, if not minutes. I think this decimates the reward, both internal and external, of actually completing the first few projects."
