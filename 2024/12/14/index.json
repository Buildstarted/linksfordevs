    "Description": "Every article about modular monoliths tells you to use public APIs between modules, but they rarely explain why these APIs exist or how to design them properly. After building several large-scale modular monoliths, I've learned that public APIs are not just about clean code - they're about controlling chaos."

    "Description": "Elon Musk’s latest legal filing against OpenAI marks his fourth attempt in less than a year to reframe his claims. However, his own words and actions speak for themselves—in 2017, Elon not only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit as OpenAI’s proposed new structure."
