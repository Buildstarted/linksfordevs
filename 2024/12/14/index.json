JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, a body that provides\nDDR specification, among other things) specifies how often this has to be done\nto ensure proper operation. However, some people are more interested in how long\nthe data may be preserved after DRAM is powered down. In this blog post, we will\ndescribe how this can be measured, and what results we managed to get on a\ncouple of tested platforms."
