The tech industry evolves at breakneck speed, and staying ahead requires more than mastering the latest tools and frameworks. To truly excel, developers must dive deep into their craft, exploring timeless programming principles, leadership, collaboration, and personal development. With their ability to distill the wisdom of experienced professionals, books remain one of the best ways to gain these insights. That’s why I’ve set a personal goal for 2025: to read one transformative book each month."

Don’t get me wrong, since its one of Nintendo’s last tile-based systems, they took the idea as far as it can go with fancy features like affine transformations, transparency, and effects applied to sprites. But at its core, it occupies a very unique space:"
