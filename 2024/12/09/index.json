There is no built in operator for a LEFT JOIN in LINQ, but you can achieve the same result by using a combination of GroupJoin, SelectMany and DefaultIfEmpty. But there is a chance that this might change in the future, as there is a proposal to add a LeftJoin operator in .net 10.\n"

You need to manage them, and make them available to other engineers working on the same repository/project. Versions need to be centrally managed, code generation must produce the same result, no matter if it happens on an engineer A or B’s machine, or in CI.\nThis becomes even more challenging, as protoc plugins are written in different programming languages."
