    "Description": "Several weeks ago we received a bug report from a customer that said their game was crashing when using IL2CPP scripting backend. QA verified the bug and assigned it to me for fixing. The project was quite big (although far from the largest ones); it took 40 minutes to build on my machine. The instructions on the bug report said: “Play the game for 5-10 minutes until it crashes”. Sure enough, after following instructions, I observed a crash. I fired up WinDbg ready to nail it down. Unfortunately, the stack trace was bogus:\n0:049&gt; k\n# Child-SP RetAddr Call Site\n00 00000022`e25feb10 00000000`00000010 0x00007ffa`00000102\n0:050&gt; u 0x00007ffa`00000102 L10\n00007ffa`00000102 ?? ???\n^ Memory access error in 'u 0x00007ffa`00000102 l10'\nClearly, it tried executing an invalid memory address. Although the stacktrace had been corrupted, I was hoping that only a part of the whole stack got corrupted and that I should be able to reconstruct it if I look at memory contents past the stack pointer register. Surely enough, that gave me an idea where to look next:\n0:049&gt; dps @rsp L200\n...............\n00000022`e25febd8 00007ffa`b1fdc65c ucrtbased!heap_alloc_dbg+0x1c

now I knew which thread was crashing: it was the IL2CPP runtime socket polling thread. Its responsibility is tell other threads when their sockets are ready to send or receive data. It goes like this: there’s a FIFO queue that socket poll requests get put in by other threads, the socket polling thread then dequeues these requests one by one, calls select() function and when select() returns a result, it queues a callback that was in the original request to the thread pool. So somebody is corrupting the stack badly. In order to narrow the search, I decided to put “stack sentinels” on most stack frames in that thread. Here’s how my stack sentinel was defined:\n"
