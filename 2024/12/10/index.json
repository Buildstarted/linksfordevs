While both AsyncLocal<T> and ThreadLocal<T> provide mechanisms for maintaining contextual data, their implementations and use cases differ significantly in ways that impact system architecture, performance, and maintainability. This comprehensive guide explores both"

In this post, I want to walk through the ways to use torch.compile, and within these use cases, what works and what doesn't. By the way, some of these gaps are either served by export, or by missing features we are actively working on, those will be some other posts!"

Over the past three decades, a number of architectural principles, design patterns, cure-alls and get-rich-quick schemes have emerged, promising a life free of production bugs and technical debt."
