This is backwards.\n\nYour first job is not to build software. Your role is to use your technical expertise to help the startup figure out fast if you have a valid solution to a compelling problem, and then a valid product for a big enough market.\n\nYou might do this through building software, but you might not need to.\n\nHere is a story of how I did this wrong, and how you can do it right.\n\n"

    "Description": "Introduction Fine-tuned BERT-style bidirectional encoders, such as E5, have long dominated text embedding models, delivering state-of-the-art performance for many sequence-level tasks at an accessible cost. However, currently, many of the top performing models on the MTEB leaderboard, a text embedding benchmark for various tasks (retrieval, clustering, classification, etc.) are decoder-only language models at the ~7B scale. These models leverage larger context windows and pretraining on web-scale data.\nThis post reviews the papers of the following models:"

While I have no quarrels with the mechanism, I thought this would be a good place to try and experiment with embeddings."
