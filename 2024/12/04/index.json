However, currently, many of the top performing models on the MTEB leaderboard, a text embedding benchmark for various tasks (retrieval, clustering, classification, etc.) are decoder-only language models at the ~7B scale. These models leverage larger context windows and pretraining on web-scale data.\nThis post reviews the papers of the following models:"
