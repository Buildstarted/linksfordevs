For example, the mean squared error (MSE) for regression seemed logical—penalizing large deviations from the ground-truth makes sense. But one thing always bothered me: I could never come up with those loss functions on my own. Where did they come from? Why do we use these specific formulas and not something else?\nThis frustration led me to dig deeper into the mathematical and probabilistic foundations of loss functions."
