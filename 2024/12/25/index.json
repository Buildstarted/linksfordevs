    "Description": "Previously, I discussed the value proposition of torch.compile.  While doing so, I observed a number of downsides (long compile time, complicated operational model, lack of packaging) that were intrinsic to torch.compile's API contract, which emphasized being able to work on Python code as is, with minimal intervention from users.  torch.export occupies a different spot in the tradeoff space: in exchange for more upfront work making a model exportable, it allows for use of PyTorch models in environments where using torch.compile as is would be impossible."

One thing I came away with was a neat trick for getting non-overloadable syntax to be overloadable."

Specifically, I would like to optimize charitable donations for maximum impact. It seems to me that there are two parts to this equation:\nWhich charity(ies)/cause(s) should I give to How much should I give? The answer to the first question is deeply personal, so I want to focus on the second question."
