When users come from the Tailscale network, the application should authenticate them and give them access to the application based on roles defined in Tailscale ACL.\nSolution Tailscale exposes an HTTP API through a Unix Socket named LocalAPI.\nIt can be used for many things. In my case, I needed to authenticate a user coming from Tailnet. I used it to get information about a Tailscale user by calling the whois endpoint."
