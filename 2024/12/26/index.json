Readers of this blog are familiar with my long-running obsession interest in RISC-V (see my RISC-V Tips and RISC-V Bytes series). However, Nordic’s introduction of a RISC-V processor is particularly interesing to me as their lineup of microcontrollers is extremely popular in low power wireless domains, a common use case for Golioth customers."
