    "Description": "Avalonia is the best-kept secret in the .NET community, and this session aims to shed light on why so many have fallen in love with it! I'll walk you through the competitive landscape of .NET UI technologies and how you can take your .NET applications to Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android and the Web. We'll start with a look at our open-source, cross-platform UI framework, Avalonia. We'll explore why industry leaders, including AMD, KLM, Unity, and GitHub, have adopted it, how you can get started with it and what makes it unique. Once we've covered Avalonia, we'll dig into how we made a binary-compatible cross-platform WPF and our exciting plans for the future.\n\n\nWith Mike James.\n\nBecome a channel member to enjoy benefits and access more content.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKnuLHRlK_zhrpaTWvNOdMA/join"
