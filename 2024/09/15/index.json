I chose 11\nfloating-point repair benchmarks, and fed all of them to Herbie and\nChatGPT. Herbie is a tool my students and I develop to do exactly this\nwork, and I wanted to know if AI tools had obsoleted it. The\nconclusion was that Herbie was still much better, winning 6/11 and\ntying two others. Moreover, the cases where Herbie lost ChatGPT's\nresponse was usually not actually much better, or was better only\nstylistically."
