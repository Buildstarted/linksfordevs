    "Description": "My journey in programming began over two decades ago, a time when JavaScript was a far cry from its current state, and developers were primarily focused on Microsoft Internet Explorer. One of my proudest achievements back then was writing a few lines of code that allowed users to add and remove table rows entirely on the client side. We called it DHTML. Many developers today have forgotten about it—or never knew it existed.   A few years later, AJAX emerged, revolutionizing the way we approached "

You aren’t communicating with each other, and you aren’t being directed by a central director, so how does the large crowd coordinate? Everyone is reacting independently using only their visual senses to estimate the velocity and size of everyone else, using that information to plan out a path to some goal."

    "Domain": "coredumped.dev",
    "Description": "In this post, we are going to take a deep dive into pointer tagging, where metadata is encoded into a word-sized pointer. Doing so allows us to keep a compact representation that can be passed around in machine registers. This is very common in implementing dynamic programming languages, but can really be used anywhere that additional runtime information is needed about a pointer. We will look at a handful of different ways these pointers can be encoded and see how the compiler can optimize them for different hardware."
