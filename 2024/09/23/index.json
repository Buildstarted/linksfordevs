    "Description": "My hypothesis was that Uber seemed to be picking a higher price because I had credits in my account. I might be willing to spend more because my 'real' out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped anyway.  I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead. That pricing seemed normal."
