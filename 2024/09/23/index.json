It's time to revisit the concept because .NET 8 has something better to offer -- Keyed Services. I am going to use the same example that I used in the earlier article. We will modify the example for .NET 8."

I might be willing to spend more because my 'real' out of pocket cost was less, and those credits were trapped anyway.  I decided to use my Uber credits for Uber Eats instead.
