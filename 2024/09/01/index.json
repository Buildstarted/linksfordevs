Calling it done Basic optimization Going deeper Simplifying calls What about clang? Drawing the rest of the eval Conclusion Appendix: methodology of benchmarks Preface Let me start with making an assumption that everyone has at some point in their life encountered a humble tree-walking interpreter. Between older implementations of popular programming languages, expression evaluators embedded in user-facing tools, and home-grown almost-a-complete-Lisp interpreters, these can still be found everywhere. This type of interpreter is considered to be the simplest - and the slowest one. Oftentimes you may see people rewriting their interpreters to a bytecode-based ones just to get a bit more performance. However, recently a project named daScript (apparently renamed to Daslang) came into my attention. It is a very fast programming language, boasting one of the fastest interpreters I ever saw. What is more interesting is that this interpreter is tree-based, and yet it still manages to outperform bytecode-based interpreters with ease. I got nerd-sniped and set out to investigate why is it so fast, and I found that it uses a pretty interesting optimization technique which authors call fusion. As always, it turned out that the idea has already been explored and is also known as supernodes or, in context of bytecode interpreters, as superoperators. In this post, I will explain how it works by optimizing a tiny model tree-walking interpreter step-by-step. There will be a lot of benchmarks and you can find the methodology at the end of this post. You can find the code here. Disclaimer: this post borrows heavily from the daScript implementation. All ideas I will explain here originally belong to daScript authors, and any mistakes you may find are mine. That said, the implementation is completely new and does not include daScript source in any form. The model task We are going to use the Fibonacci function. Our humble hero looks like this: uint32_t fib(uint32_t i) { if (i < 2) { return i; } return fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2); } It may look simple, but it has a lot going on. Consider what an interpreter should implement to be able to evaluate it: Function calls Recursive function calls Argument accesses Two different arithmetic operators A comparison operator Conditional control flow And this is what makes it a good model task: it is short and simple to implement in any language, and it is sufficiently complex at the same time to impose certain requirements on the environment it is being implemented in. With this model in mind, let’s consider what exactly we will be measuring. We only have most basic evaluation primitives in play - there is no memory management, no type checks, just raw evaluation, so we will be measuring just that - performance of evaluation primitives. The benchmark will say nothing about performance of each primitive used, but will be able to give us a rough impression on which approach performs better. I put all implementations in a single source file; calls to each implementation are guarded with a particular preprocessor directive in the source to avoid parsing command line flags in order to keep things simple. Let’s put the code above to the test and calculate fib(42): > cl_build.bat /DBASELINE oif.cpp > hyperfine oif.exe Benchmark 1: oif.exe Time (mean ± σ): 817.2 ms ± 6.4 ms [User: 593.8 ms, System: 4.6 ms] Range (min … max): 808.6 ms … 828.9 ms 10 runs World’s simplest interpreter As I mentioned earliear, the venerable tree-walking interpreter is the simplest and arguably easiest to implement type of evaluator. A quick recap on how it works: The interpreter operates on a tree consisting of nodes, which may or may not have child nodes Evaluating a node yields a result If a node has any children, they have to be evaluated first before the parent node itself could be evaluated (thus the interpreter walks the tree recursively in depth-first order) Evaluating the root node yields the result of evaluation of the entire program In the scope of this post, I will assume the following: There is no type checking during evaluation There is no memory management There are no other extraneous checks There is only single supported type, unsigned 32-bit integer (uint32_t) Let’s imagine what our fib() function would look like if implemented in such an interpreter: uint32_t fib(uint32_t n) { Context ctx; Function* function = new Function(); function->init({ new IfNode( new LessNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2)), new ReturnNode(new ArgNode())), new ReturnNode( new AddNode( new CallNode(function, new SubNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(1))), new CallNode(function, new SubNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2))))) }); CallNode* call = new CallNode(function, new ConstNode(n)); uint32_t result = call->eval(&ctx); delete function; delete call; return result; } This is an exact mapping from our C++ implementation to our imaginary tree-walking interpreter: it implements the same operations our C++ implementation does, and performs them in the same order. Now, let’s try to actually make it work. Base node and constants The very first thing we will do is to define the basic shape of a node: struct Node { virtual ~Node() {} virtual uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) { return 0; } }; There’s really not that much to it. It’s just a class with a single virtual method eval() that accepts a mutable global interpreter state (also known as context) - more on that later. The ConstNode is not that much interesting either - it just evaluates to the value it holds: struct ConstNode : Node { uint32_t value; ConstNode(uint32_t value) : value(value) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return value; } }; Arithmetic, comparison and conditional execution These are a bit more complex since they have two child nodes which should be recursively evaluated before the value of the node itself can be computed, but these are not terribly complicated either: struct AddNode : Node { Node* lhs; Node* rhs; AddNode(Node* lhs, Node* rhs) : lhs(lhs), rhs(rhs) {} ~AddNode() { delete lhs; delete rhs; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return lhs->eval(ctx) + rhs->eval(ctx); } }; struct SubNode : Node { Node* lhs; Node* rhs; SubNode(Node* lhs, Node* rhs) : lhs(lhs), rhs(rhs) {} ~SubNode() { delete lhs; delete rhs; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return lhs->eval(ctx) - rhs->eval(ctx); } }; struct LessNode : Node { Node* lhs; Node* rhs; ~LessNode() { delete lhs; delete rhs; } LessNode(Node* lhs, Node* rhs) : lhs(lhs), rhs(rhs) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return lhs->eval(ctx) < rhs->eval(ctx); } }; Now that we have a comparison node, it would make sense to implement a conditional execution node to be able to use it: struct IfNode : Node { Node* condition; Node* body; IfNode(Node* condition, Node* body) : condition(condition), body(body) {} ~IfNode() { delete condition; delete body; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { if (condition->eval(ctx)) { body->eval(ctx); } return 0; } }; I omitted implementation of the else branch, as it is not needed by our first implementation, but we will return to it just a bit later. Functions, calls, return statements and argument access Next, let’s implement function calls and related nodes. This is arguably the most complex part of the entire interpreter, but as you will see, it’s actually pretty straightforward. In our simple interpreter a function is just a list of nodes of a fixed length: struct Function { Node** body; uint32_t numNodes; Function() : body(0), numNodes(0) {} void init(std::initializer_list<Node*> body) { numNodes = (uint32_t) body.size(); this->body = new Node * [numNodes]; uint32_t i = 0; for (Node* statement : body) { this->body[i++] = statement; } } ~Function() { for (uint32_t i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) { delete body[i]; } delete[] body; } }; As you can see, a function itself is not a node, and as such cannot be evaluated. Instead, to actually evaluate it we will use a different node representing a function call: struct CallNode : Node { Function* function; Node* arg; CallNode(Function* function, Node* arg) : function(function), arg(arg) {} ~CallNode() { delete arg; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { ctx->stack[ctx->stackTop] = arg->eval(ctx); ctx->stackTop += 1; for (uint32_t i = 0, end_i = function->numNodes; i < end_i; i++) { function->body[i]->eval(ctx); if (ctx->stopForReturn) { break; } } ctx->stopForReturn = false; ctx->stackTop -= 1; return ctx->returnValue; } }; Let’s unpack what is happening here. A CallNode represents a unary function call, that is, a call of a function that only takes a single argument. This argument is evaluated and put on the stack, in order for us to be able to access it later when evaluating the function body. Use of the stack will also allow us to create recursive functions. To evaluate a function we just iterate over the nodes of the function’s body and evaluate them sequentially. That would be pretty much it, except we also need to support the return statement and ability to return values from the function. In order to do that, we need two pieces of state: a flag which indicates that the return statement has been encountered and we need to stop the evaluation and return control to the caller, and a field which holds the value that we should return. We reset the former before exiting to ensure that the subsequent function calls will not return immediately and we use the latter as the actual result of evaluation of the call. Let’s implement the ReturnNode: struct ReturnNode : Node { Node* rhs; ReturnNode(Node* rhs) : rhs(rhs) {} ~ReturnNode() { delete rhs; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { ctx->returnValue = rhs->eval(ctx); ctx->stopForReturn = true; // Since we pass the result in the ctx->returnValue field, // we don't need to return anything here return 0; } }; It evaluates the right-hand-side node, puts the result into context and signals that return statement has been encountered. Last, but not least, we need to implement a way to access function arguments: struct ArgNode : Node { ArgNode() {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return ctx->stack[ctx->stackTop - 1]; } }; ArgNode just returns the topmost value on the stack. This is enough since we only deal with unary functions; it would be just a tad more complicated if we were to support multiple arguments. What about the context? Now that we know which state we need to be available for all nodes, we can put it all in a simple neat struct: struct Context { bool stopForReturn; uint32_t returnValue; uint32_t* stack; uint32_t stackTop; Context() : stopForReturn(false), returnValue(0), stack(new uint32_t[4096]), stackTop(0) {} ~Context() { delete[] stack; } }; Calling it done Let’s take a look at our function once again: uint32_t fib(uint32_t n) { Context ctx; Function* function = new Function(); function->init({ new IfNode( new LessNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2)), new ReturnNode(new ArgNode())), new ReturnNode( new AddNode( new CallNode(function, new SubNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(1))), new CallNode(function, new SubNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2))))) }); CallNode* call = new CallNode(function, new ConstNode(n)); uint32_t result = call->eval(&ctx); delete function; delete call; return result; } Now that we know how exactly each node is implemented, it all starts to make sense. There is only one thing to point out: the instantiation and initialization of the function are split into two parts in order for us to be able to refer to the function from inside of its body. Congratulations! We have just implemented the simplest possible interpreter that can actually compute the value of the Fibonacci function. It is more or less the same as tree-walking interpreter straight from a CS course or one of the “building a Lisp” books: We have some kind of a data structure representing an AST node We have polymorphic dispatch that allows us to evaluate different kinds of nodes in different ways We can recursively evaluate an AST tree to compute a single value, the result of evaluation Our implementation is powerful enough to evaluate recursive functions Now, let’s see how it performs: > cl_build.bat /DSIMPLEST oif.cpp > hyperfine oif.exe Benchmark 1: oif.exe Time (mean ± σ): 10.022 s ± 1.349 s [User: 5.452 s, System: 0.009 s] Range (min … max): 8.468 s … 12.096 s 10 runs …Huh. It’s an order of magnitude slower than the baseline implementation. As expected, even the simplest tree-walking interpreter is quite slow compared to equivalent C++ code. But don’t worry, it will get better. Basic optimization While this code looks like an absolute minimal implementation, there are still ways to make it even smaller. One way to do this would be to merge, or fuse, our small nodes into larger and more specialized nodes to reduce overhead introduced by virtual function calls, among other things. Good candidates to fuse would be nodes that take constant arguments. In our case, that would be LessNode and SubNode. Let’s implement fused versions: struct LessConstNode : Node { Node* lhs; uint32_t constant; LessConstNode(Node* lhs, uint32_t constant) : lhs(lhs), constant(constant) {} ~LessConstNode() { delete lhs; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) { return lhs->eval(ctx) < constant; } }; struct SubConstNode : Node { Node* lhs; uint32_t constant; SubConstNode(Node* lhs, uint32_t constant) : lhs(lhs), constant(constant) {} ~SubConstNode() { delete lhs; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) { return lhs->eval(ctx) - constant; } }; And update our function to use these nodes: uint32_t fib(uint32_t n) { Context ctx; Function* function = new Function(); function->init({ new IfNode( new LessConstNode(new ArgNode(), 2), new ReturnNode(new ArgNode())), new ReturnNode( new AddNode( new CallNode(function, new SubConstNode(new ArgNode(), 1)), new CallNode(function, new SubConstNode(new ArgNode(), 2)))) }); CallNode* call = new CallNode(function, new ConstNode(n)); uint32_t result = call->eval(&ctx); delete function; delete call; return result; } That’s it, on to benchmarking: > cl_build.bat /DSIMPLE_FUSION oif.cpp > hyperfine oif.exe Benchmark 1: oif.exe Time (mean ± σ): 6.609 s ± 0.015 s [User: 2.890 s, System: 0.001 s] Range (min … max): 6.584 s … 6.633 s 10 runs Implementing this simple optimization makes our interpreter almost two times faster than our initial implementation. Going deeper Continuing this line of thought, let’s take it further. What else can we merge or remove? We can introduce new, even more specialized nodes - not just “less-than-constant” node, but “argument-less-than-constant” node, and a similar one for subtraction: struct LessArgConstNode : Node { uint32_t constant; LessArgConstNode(uint32_t constant) : constant(constant) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return ctx->stack[ctx->stack_top - 1] < constant; } }; struct SubArgConstNode : Node { uint32_t constant; SubArgConstNode(uint32_t constant) : constant(constant) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return ctx->stack[ctx->stack_top - 1] - constant; } }; And this is where we should stop and reconsider what we are doing. As you can see, we copied the entire implementation of the ArgNode into these new node types, just like we did before for ConstNode. It may look innocuous at this point, however, this is quite error-prone and will quickly become tedious as more fused node types are introduced. Actually, there is a way to remove duplication. We will introduce a new method, compute(Context* ctx), and make sure it is always inlined. We will also express our eval(Context* ctx) method in terms of compute(Context* ctx). This way we will always have a single implementation for a single node type, which can then be embedded in any other node. Strictly speaking, we don’t want to do this for all nodes (and it barely makes sense to do this for ConstNode), but I will still do it this way for the sake of consistency. One more thing to mention before we proceed is that compute(Context* ctx) is non-virtual. This means that we can only use it when we know the exact type of the node on which we call it on. In case of more generic nodes we should still use eval(Context* ctx). This is what updated versions of the nodes look like: #if defined(__clang__) #define FORCEINLINE __attribute__((always_inline)) #elif defined(_MSC_VER) // clang defines _MSC_VER on Windows for some reason #define FORCEINLINE __forceinline #endif struct ConstNode : Node { uint32_t value; ConstNode(uint32_t value) : value(value) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return compute(ctx); } uint32_t FORCEINLINE compute(Context* ctx) { return value; } }; struct ArgNode : Node { ArgNode() {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return compute(ctx); } uint32_t FORCEINLINE compute(Context* ctx) { return ctx->stack[ctx->stackTop - 1]; } }; struct LessArgConstNode : Node { ArgNode* lhs; ConstNode* rhs; LessArgConstNode(ArgNode* lhs, ConstNode* rhs) : lhs(lhs), rhs(rhs) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { return compute(ctx); } uint32_t FORCEINLINE compute(Context* ctx) { return lhs->compute(ctx) < rhs->compute(ctx); } }; struct SubArgConstNode : Node { ArgNode* lhs; ConstNode* rhs; SubArgConstNode(ArgNode* lhs, ConstNode* rhs) : lhs(lhs), rhs(rhs) {} uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) { return compute(ctx); } uint32_t FORCEINLINE compute(Context* ctx) { return lhs->compute(ctx) - rhs->compute(ctx); } }; With these our Fibonacci function becomes: uint32_t fib(uint32_t n) { Context ctx; Function* function = new Function(); function->init({ new IfNode( new LessArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2)), new ReturnNode(new ArgNode())), new ReturnNode( new AddNode( new CallNode(function, new SubArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(1))), new CallNode(function, new SubArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2))))) }); CallNode* call = new CallNode(function, new ConstNode(n)); uint32_t result = call->eval(&ctx); delete function; delete call; return result; } What’s great about this is that not only did we get rid of the code duplication and associated pitfalls, but we also gained the ability to easily generate new fused node types (for example, with macros) and we paid no additional performance cost for this. And we also gained a bit of performance: > cl_build.bat /DBETTER_FUSION oif.cpp > hyperfine oif.exe Benchmark 1: oif.exe Time (mean ± σ): 5.412 s ± 0.067 s [User: 3.266 s, System: 0.005 s] Range (min … max): 5.353 s … 5.514 s 10 runs This shaves another half of a second, nice. But we still can do better. Simplifying calls Let’s take a look at our Fibonacci function again and figure out what else we can do. Going from the top of the function, the first thing we see is a Function wrapper. We only need it in order to be able to evaluate several nodes sequentially, and, more importantly, to be able to refer to the function from its body to perform recursive calls. However, all the evaluation logic belongs to CallNode, meaning that we probably can do without this wrapper. In order to remove it, we will need to do the following: Update CallNode to be able to accept any Node as callable instead of a Function pointer Add ability to use else branches to the IfNode While we are at it, we can also remove one ReturnNode instance by allowing the IfNode to return evaluation results of it branches. I will implement new versions of the nodes as separate classes so that we will be able to see the old and new implementations side-by-side: struct CallAnyNode : Node { Node* function; Node* arg; CallAnyNode(Node* function, Node* arg) : function(function), arg(arg) {} ~CallAnyNode() { delete arg; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { ctx->stack[ctx->stackTop] = arg->eval(ctx); ctx->stackTop += 1; uint32_t result = function->eval(ctx); ctx->stopForReturn = false; ctx->stackTop -= 1; return result; } }; struct IfElseNode : Node { Node* condition; Node* ifBody; Node* elseBody; IfElseNode(Node* condition, Node* ifBody, Node* elseBody) : condition(condition), ifBody(ifBody), elseBody(elseBody) {} ~IfElseNode() { delete condition; delete ifBody; delete elseBody; } uint32_t eval(Context* ctx) override { if (condition->eval(ctx)) { return ifBody->eval(ctx); } else { return elseBody->eval(ctx); } } }; With these, our function now looks like this: uint32_t fib(uint32_t n) { using BetterFusion::ArgNode; using BetterFusion::ConstNode; Context ctx; IfElseNode function(0, 0, 0); function.condition = new LessArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2)); function.ifBody = new ArgNode(); function.elseBody = new AddNode( new CallAnyNode(&function, new SubArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(1))), new CallAnyNode(&function, new SubArgConstNode(new ArgNode(), new ConstNode(2)))); CallAnyNode call(&function, new ConstNode(n)); uint32_t result = call.eval(&ctx); return result; } While our first interpreter was a 1-1 mapping from the C++ source code, this one resembles the actual compiled code - probably, at the very least at one of the stages. Which should give you intuition on what is actually happening here: we are doing the job of an optimizing compiler manually and observe effects of optimizations first-hand. What about the timings? > cl_build.bat /DSIMPLIFY_CALLS oif.cpp > hyperfine oif.exe Benchmark 1: oif.exe Time (mean ± σ): 3.761 s ± 0.013 s [User: 1.884 s, System: 0.005 s] Range (min … max): 3.743 s … 3.783 s 10 runs And another second and a half gone. This will be the last version of the interpreter within the scope of this post. We went from 10.02s to 3.76s - the final version is 2.66 times faster than our initial implementation and only 4.6 times slower than the baseline C++ version. To put things in perspective, let’s add some real interpreter results: > node --version v18.18.0 > hyperfine \"node fib.js\" Benchmark 1: node fib.js Time (mean ± σ): 1.746 s ± 0.050 s [User: 0.823 s, System: 0.007 s] Range (min … max): 1.694 s … 1.854 s 10 runs > python --version Python 3.10.4 > hyperfine \"python fib.py\" Benchmark 1: python fib.py Time (mean ± σ): 35.415 s ± 0.697 s [User: 18.959 s, System: 0.020 s] Range (min … max): 34.892 s … 37.312 s 10 runs > ruby --version ruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x64-mingw-ucrt] > hyperfine \"ruby fib.rb\" Benchmark 1: ruby fib.rb Time (mean ± σ): 12.796 s ± 0.201 s [User: 6.513 s, System: 0.021 s] Range (min … max): 12.637 s … 13.317 s 10 runs > luajit -v LuaJIT 2.0.4 -- Copyright (C) 2005-2015 Mike Pall. http://luajit.org/ > hyperfine \"luajit fib.lua\" Benchmark 1: luajit fib.lua Time (mean ± σ): 1.097 s ± 0.011 s [User: 0.713 s, System: 0.001 s] Range (min … max): 1.082 s … 1.110 s 10 runs > hyperfine \"luajit -joff fib.lua\" Benchmark 1: luajit -joff fib.lua Time (mean ± σ): 7.966 s ± 0.029 s [User: 4.146 s, System: 0.002 s] Range (min … max): 7.915 s … 8.005 s 10 runs Some thoughts on these results: Both JITs leave everything else in the dust, with LuaJIT 2 being 1.7x faster than V8 As expected, real interpreters are much, much slower than our toy interpreter But I did not expect Ruby being almost 3 times faster than Python!

Honestly, I rarely use clang due to a force of habit, so imagine my surprise when I saw this: > clang++ --version clang version 17.0.6 Target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc Thread model: posix InstalledDir: D:\\Tools\\LLVM\\bin > clang++ -O3 -ffast-math -DBASELINE oif.cpp -o oif-clang.exe > hyperfine oif-clang.exe Benchmark 1: oif-clang.exe Time (mean ± σ): 503.4 ms ± 6.8 ms [User: 315.3 ms, System: 3.0 ms] Range (min … max): 494.9 ms … 514.0 ms 10 runs > clang++ -Ofast -ffast-math -DSIMPLEST oif.cpp -o oif-clang.exe > hyperfine oif-clang.exe Benchmark 1: oif-clang.exe Time (mean ± σ): 8.604 s ± 0.072 s [User: 4.393 s, System: 0.003 s] Range (min … max): 8.476 s … 8.744 s 10 runs > clang++ -O3 -ffast-math -DSIMPLE_FUSION oif.cpp -o oif-clang.exe > hyperfine oif-clang.exe Benchmark 1: oif-clang.exe Time (mean ± σ): 7.050 s ± 0.045 s [User: 3.069 s, System: 0.005 s] Range (min … max): 6.991 s … 7.147 s 10 runs > clang++ -O3 -ffast-math -DBETTER_FUSION oif.cpp -o oif-clang.exe > hyperfine oif-clang.exe Benchmark 1: oif-clang.exe Time (mean ± σ): 5.434 s ± 0.015 s [User: 2.588 s, System: 0.004 s] Range (min … max): 5.418 s … 5.468 s 10 runs > clang++ -O3 -ffast-math -DSIMPLIFY_CALLS oif.cpp -o oif-clang.exe > hyperfine oif-clang.exe Benchmark 1: oif-clang.exe Time (mean ± σ): 5.012 s ± 0.033 s [User: 2.391 s, System: 0.003 s] Range (min … max): 4.968 s … 5.074 s 10 runs I am not sure what to make of this, except that I certainly did not expect these results. The baseline and the first, unoptimized version of the interpreter are a bit faster, but all of the optimizations have far less of an effect. I definitely need to dig into this, but this post is already long as it is. Drawing the rest of the eval I handwaved away a lot of the important parts of a real interpreter at the very beginning of this post, so let’s take a step back. First and foremost, the optimized representation is more like a bytecode - you probably should not attempt to parse directly into it. Instead, you will need an optimizing pass (or rather optimizing passes) that will transform your AST into this representation. Just like an optimizing compiler would do. You also want to be able to work with different types of data, and you want to minimize conversions between these types. Anything not strictly related to evaluation - any type checks, conversions, and allocations - will inevitably affect performance. But you will also need to perform type-checking somewhere, just not at the hot path. This suggests that this approach is best suited for statically typed languages; however, you probably can do something like a tracing JIT where you figure out types for a subtree dynamically during runtime, generate an optimized representation on the fly and use guards to make sure that the types were not changed during execution. Next, in a real interpreter you would probably like to call functions with more than one argument. And you will need a function wrapper for functions that are not as simple as Fibonacci function. Passing arguments will also take time. All in all, this post only covers a very tiny, very specific part of what an interpreter should do, but I hope it manages to explain how tree-walking interpeters can be made much faster and that it will still be useful to someone. Conclusion Even something as simple as a tree-walking interpreter can sometimes be made even simpler, for surprising results. My thanks go to Anton Yudintsev and Boris Batkin for daScript, the implementation of which served as inspiration for this post. I should note that there is a whole bunch of tricks the daScript interpreter uses besides fusion, which I hope to explore in detail in posts to come. You may find the entire source code for the interpreter here. Thank you for staying with me until the very end! See you, and stay tuned! Appendix: methodology of benchmarks I won’t go into much detail on perils of benchmarking in 2024, but know that there are many. Contrary to popular belief, implementing a benchmark that measures what you think it is measuring is a feat in and of itself, and is a proper rabbit hole - far too deep than I wanted to take you today. Perhaps I will write another post on this topic sometime. In the scope of this post, however, I have taken it easy. I used hyperfine and I tried to make sure that the load of our benchmark is heavy enough to overweigh any start-up costs of any interpreter we are going to use. In this setup, precise number of milliseconds doesn’t really matter, just the relative performance compared to a set baseline. The code was compiled using MSVC 2022 cl 19.38.33130 with the following command line flags: /permissive- /GS /GL /W3 /Gy /Zc:wchar_t /Zi /Gm- /O2 /sdl /Zc:inline /fp:fast /D \"NDEBUG\" /WX- /Zc:forScope /Gd /Oi /MD /FC /EHsc /nologo /Ot /Fp I wrapped this thing in a .bat file for convenience, which you can find with the rest of the source."
