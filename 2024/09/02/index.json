The DRY principle     'Don‚Äôt repeat yourself' (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.    ‚Äî https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[Wiki"

If I‚Äôm not digitizing them, I‚Äôll write notes on index cards and store them in boxes for organizing. As long as I can keep the boxes, I get to keep my notes. Notational Velocity is a text editor that lets me quickly search and switch between files.

Saying outrageous things, in interviews or on social media, that we would not have expected high-profile people to do a few decades ago (at least not in public).  Any explanation of this, needs to not only explain why it happens so often now, but also why it hasn't always been happening.  So, \"people are crazy\", \"people are stupid\", and that sort of thing, do not work as explanations, because that has always been true.  Why in public now?  Why the most high-profile people?"

In this article we will discuss two better ways of storing the database connection string. Firstly, we will learn to store the connection string into the Azure App Service itself. And then we will store it in Azure Key Vault."
