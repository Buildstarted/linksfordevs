    "Description": "I have played a little bit with OpenAI's new iteration of GPT, GPT-o1, which performs an initial reasoning step before running the LLM.  It is certainly a more capable tool than previous iterations, though still struggling with the most advanced research mathematical tasks.\n\nHere are some concrete experiments (with a prototype version of the model that I was granted access to).  In https://chatgpt.com/share/2ecd7b73-3607-46b3-b855-b29003333b87 I repeated an experiment from https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/109948249160170335 in which I asked GPT to answer a vaguely worded mathematical query which could be solved by identifying a suitable theorem (Cramer's theorem) from the literature.  Previously, GPT was able to mention some relevant concepts but the details were hallucinated nonsense.  This time around, Cramer's theorem was identified and a perfectly satisfactory answer was given. (1/3)"

Sounds familiar? If you’re thinking, “Hey, that’s the plot of every hacker movie ever,” you’re not wrong. But here’s the kicker – it’s about as realistic as expecting your computer to make you a sandwich when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delicious.\nThe Myth of the Coding Hermit\nLet’s face it, we’ve all dreamed of being that lone wolf developer at some point. I know I have – there was a time when I thought I could conquer the coding world armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. My code looked like it had been written by a caffeinated squirrel, and my only collaborator was my increasingly concerned houseplant."

The richer in detail it is, the better it is."
