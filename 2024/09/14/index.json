    "Description": "Picture this: a dimly lit room, the soft glow of multiple monitors, and a solitary figure hunched over a keyboard, fingers flying as they single-handedly save the world through code. Sounds familiar? If you’re thinking, “Hey, that’s the plot of every hacker movie ever,” you’re not wrong. But here’s the kicker – it’s about as realistic as expecting your computer to make you a sandwich when you hit Ctrl+Alt+Delicious.\nThe Myth of the Coding Hermit\nLet’s face it, we’ve all dreamed of being that lone wolf developer at some point. I know I have – there was a time when I thought I could conquer the coding world armed with nothing but my trusty laptop and an unhealthy amount of caffeine. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well. My code looked like it had been written by a caffeinated squirrel, and my only collaborator was my increasingly concerned houseplant."

    "Description": "When I chose to pursue a career in computer science when I was 15 years old, it was basically on liking math and physics. I want to distance myself from writing posts, essays, etc. Time goes by, and now, one of the things that I value at a mature company or team is the existence of technical documentation.\nDocs help us to gain historical knowledge of our company, reevaluate decisions, and comprehend the trade-offs between all the decisions.\nIt is also beneficial for the newcomers because it tells them a story. The richer in detail it is, the better it is."
