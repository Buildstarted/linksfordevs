Guile is a Scheme dialect that features an\nadvanced optimizing bytecode compiler, a JIT compiler, and a modest\nset of developer tools for inspecting and debugging.  Through my time\nspent developing Chickadee, a game\nprogramming library, I have gotten quite familiar with how to get the\nmost out of Guile in terms of performance.  Every now and then I share\na tip or two with someone on IRC or the fediverse and think “I should\nblog about this” so now I’m finally doing that.  These tips are quite\nsimple and apply to optimizing any dynamic language.  The only\ndifference is that there isn’t much in the way of helpful examples\nspecifically for Guile… until now."

We don’t currently have any full-time SREs assigned to respond to incidents for the product we’re building, work on observability, follow up on post-mortems, or other operational tasks."
