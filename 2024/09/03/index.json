    "Description": "When I was 11 years old I was told I had a learning disability called Dysgraphia, although it’s now called “an impairment in written expression” by the DSM-5. This wasn’t a surprise given my handwriting was pretty bad, writing even the slightest bit legibly took forever, and by the 4th grade I was already starting to lose points on assignments because I’d lose track of what I had written. Thankfully, a middle school guidance counselor was reasonably well read on it and got me an accommodation to use my laptop for notes, assignments, and tests."
