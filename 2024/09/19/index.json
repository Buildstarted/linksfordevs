If you want to model all possible executions of a concurrent system - so the thinking goes - all you have to do is define:\nThe set of variables modeling your system The values of those variables in the initial state(s) Possible actions changing those variables to generate successor states Safety invariants you want to be true in every state The model checker will then use breadth-first search (BFS) to churn through all possible states (& thus execution orders) of your system, validating your invariants."

    "Description": "When most folks talk about the economics of cloud systems, their focus is on automatically scaling for long-term seasonality: changes on the order of days (fewer people buy things at night), weeks (fewer people visit the resort on weekdays), seasons, and holidays. Scaling for this kind of seasonality is useful and important, but there‚Äôs another factor that can be even more important and is often overlooked: short-term peak-to-average. Roughly speaking, the cost of a system scales with its (short-term1) peak traffic, but for most applications the value the system generates scales with the (long-term) average traffic."
