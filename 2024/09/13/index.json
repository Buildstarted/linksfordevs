    "Description": "For the past two years Charles Zhang and I have been working on getting my game engine, Trial, running on the Nintendo Switch. The primary challenge in doing this is porting the underlying Common Lisp runtime to work on this platform. We knew going into this that it was going to be hard, but it has proven to be quite a bit more tricky than expected. I'd like to outline some of the challenges of the platform here for posterity, though please also understand that due to Nintendo's NDA I can't go into too much detail."

If you’re not based in the US or Canada, you might find it unrelatable for other reasons.)\nThere’s been so, so many layoffs visible on LinkedIn and elsewhere recently, and it’s clear that they’re causing a lot of pain, anxiety, and uncertainty."

People want it and it changes the way people think."
