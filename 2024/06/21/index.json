Dentists, plumbers, design agencies, pool cleaner, consultants: these are all service businesses.\nThe opposite of a service business is a product business, where your company develops a product and sells it to customers. Your dentist pays for a practice-management software product and a bunch of teeth cleaning products like drills, mirrors, and suctions, but you pay for the service of a biannual dental checkup."
