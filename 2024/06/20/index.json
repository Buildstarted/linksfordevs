    "Description": "Welcome to the latest edition of my on-going series in Cray-related computational necromancy. This was another just-for-fun project. Over the many years Andras and I have been working on our Cray revival efforts, there has always been a big lag between our available software (and Andras’ amazing simulator) and my FPGA-compatible Verilog implementation. My free time and interests have oscillated wildly over the years, and implementing and debugging hardware is generally everything-intensive. My original cycle-accurate (but buggy) Cray-1 RTL gradually morphed first into a binary-compatible, but less-accurate Cray X-MP (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 24-bit addresses instead of 22-bit), and finally into a binary-compatible and not-at-all cycle-accurate Cray Y-MP/C90/J90 core (which is mostly just a Cray-1 with 32-bit addresses). During the final transition, it got a full re-write in System Verilog and a vast simplification in the hopes I’ll someday actually be able to boot up UNICOS on it. That hasn’t quite happened yet, but it’s far enough along that I felt it was ready to play around with and make it into a ‘real’ project. What to do with this? A Cray Wristwatch, of course!"

As applications grow more complex and user expectations for responsiveness increase, developers need to harness the power of concurrent programming to build efficient and scalable systems. Rust, with its unique ownership model, safety guarantees, and powerful concurrency primitives, provides an excellent foundation for tackling these challenges. In this post, we’ll dive deep into concurrency in Rust, focusing on advanced patterns with async/await and the Tokio runtime."
