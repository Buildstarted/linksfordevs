Machine learning models and LLMs are becoming more powerful and useful, but they are still black boxes, and we don’t understand how they do the things that they are capable of. It seems like it would be useful if we could understand how they work."

Someone commented\nthat you don’t need profilers - just Ctrl-C your program in a debugger instead, and you’ll see the call stack where your program\nprobably spends most of its time. I admit that I sneered at the idea at the time, because, despite those comments’ almost\naggressive enthusiasm, this method doesn’t actually work on the hard problems. But as my outlook on life worsened with age, I\ncame to think that Ctrl-C profiling deserves a shout-out, because it’s very effective against stupid problems encountered by\nlazy people operating in unfriendly environments."
