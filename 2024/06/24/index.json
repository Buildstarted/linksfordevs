But I still think the process it took me to uncover this bug could be interesting. It's also kind of interesting that a simple bug stayed undiscovered for so long. I will speculate why that is later. Now let's start."

    "Description": "Whenever I implement a PLL or a similar control loop, I invariably consult the formulas in the paper Controlled-Root Formulation for Digital Phase-Locked Loops, by Stephens and Thomas. Other sources that give formulas for the loop coefficients in terms of the loop bandwidth perform a continuous time analysis and then use a bilinear transform or a similar kind of transform to translate results between continuous time and discrete time. The appeal of the paper by Stephens and Thomas is that they work directly in discrete time, using a beautiful complex contour integral argument to calculate the loop bandwidth in terms of the loop coefficients for a loop of any order. Unfortunately, their method doesn’t give a closed-form formula for the loop coefficients in terms of the loop bandwidth. The loop coefficients can be obtained numerically, and the paper gives tables for common loop bandwidths and orders."
