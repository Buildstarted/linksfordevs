It‚Äôs no surprise that it is as popular as it is since it can help authors focus more on the art of writing rather than the aesthetics of their work. While there is a standard specification for the language, there are extensions to the Markdown syntax that can enhance the authoring experience in niche contexts. For example, LaTex support for mathematics, improved media support for online services like YouTube, and diagram support via Mermaid for all aspiring software architects."
