    "Description": "Today, my book Hacks, Leaks, and Revelations: The Art of Analyzing Hacked and Leaked Data is available for sale wherever books are sold! My goal with this book is to teach journalists, researchers, and activists all the skills they need to download and analyze any datasets they get their hands on, finding all of the juicy revelations they might contain. No prior experience is required. You can think of following along with my book as taking a complete course where you'll download real leaked datasets, and then (by following alongside the exercises) learn the tools and coding required to analyze them. The paperback costs about $50 and the ebook costs about $40. However, I don't want the price to be a barrier to access to anyone who needs this information. For this reason, I also decided to release the book for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. In other words, I'm giving away the PDF version for free."
