In this post, youâ€™ll find crucial information about important dates you need to know if youâ€™re in the process of transitioning from Xamarin to .NET MAUI or if youâ€™re still using Xamarin. Moreover, Iâ€™ll share how you can become an active contributor to this tool by providing your valuable feedback to the Microsoft team about your experience migrating applications from Xamarin to .NET MAUI. I hope you find it as useful as I did!"

In describing and evaluating them, one should enter the state of mind of the experimental physicist, rather then that of the mathematician. Numerical experiments cannot be used to prove theorems; but, from the physicist's point of view, they do often provide convincing evidence for the existence of a phenomenon. We will therefore follow an informal, descriptive and non-rigorous approach. Briefly stated, our aim will be to understand the fundamental properties of dynamical systems rather then to prove them."
