    "Description": "NeurIPS is the top conference for artificial intelligence (AI) research [2]. It offers an excellent opportunity to present your work to fellow researchers, gain a sense of the latest developments in AI, and connect with the people driving the field. Despite having my paper accepted, I couldn’t attend the last two sessions due to COVID and visa issues. However, I managed to participate in this year’s conference in New Orleans, United States. It was an incredible week filled with all things AI. In the following, I will document the talks I attended, the papers I liked, the people I met, and the things I learned."

    "Description": "I recently read about the news that garbage collection support, which was added to C++, is now actually being removed from it. Apparently most people didn’t use it, or even knew it was officially added, so it is no great loss. It always shocks me to read articles about C++ with a version number, because as far as I am concerned, C++ has no version number and never will, in the same way that a language such as English has no ‘version number’. I’m 54 and its pretty rare that I add a new word to my English vocabulary, and its even rarer for me to learn something new about C++ that I start to use in my code."
