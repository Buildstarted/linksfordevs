I used C++ in constrained environments where clock cycles mattered, and Python when we needed to iterate quickly and be productive. They felt like different ends of the spectrum, and I learned what I liked and didn’t like about both languages.\nPython Likes: Flexible Productive Standard library Lots of good libraries on Pypi Python Dislikes: Environment management Not efficient You have to accept dynamic typing C++ Likes: Speed and efficiency STL - good C++ is elegant C++ Dislikes: CMAKE Undefined behavior Older code - bad C++ gives Perl a run for its money."
