Devices that require the cloud to be controllable are getting a points deduction when comparing devices.\nIn my opinion all devices should have a local api, and if they have a cloud api, it should be optional. I don’t want to be forced to use the cloud and I want to be able to control my devices locally.\nI discovered that my oven talks to questionable countries so I disconnected it from the internet. Recently Haier threatened an open-source developer with legal action because he made a home assistant plugin for his own Haier applicance.\n\n            Dishwasher on a cloud\n        \n"
