When buying devices I always look for devices that have a local API, so I can integrate them in my home automation system. Devices that require the cloud to be controllable are getting a points deduction when comparing devices.\nIn my opinion all devices should have a local api, and if they have a cloud api, it should be optional. I don’t want to be forced to use the cloud and I want to be able to control my devices locally.\nI discovered that my oven talks to questionable countries so I disconnected it from the internet. Recently Haier threatened an open-source developer with legal action because he made a home assistant plugin for his own Haier applicance.\n\n            Dishwasher on a cloud\n        \n"

With thematic elements scaling across cells, cities, and imagined universes, Un·parched captures the complexities of livelihood and loss amidst entropic chaos. At the heart of this collection is a deep rooted desire to find and celebrate organic beauty in the most unexpected places."
