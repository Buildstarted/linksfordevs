I don‚Äôt really like doing posts like this‚ÄîI‚Äôd much rather share some innocuous learnings or tips but it turns out I have opinions too üòì Sorry! Since I quit Mozilla and went back to full-time Web development, I‚Äôve discovered a few surprises. It turns out Web development is actually pretty hard, Web developers are actually very smart, and some of these frameworks and techniques we mocked as browser engineers aren‚Äôt so bad. Oops. At the same time, it turns out some Web developers have ideas about browsers and the Web that, as a former browser engineer and standards editor, I‚Äôm a bit dubious of. Here are a few of the things that surprised me."

I wanted to consolidate my thoughts on architecture and transform them into a solid foundation for what I call the ‚ÄúRed Tortoise‚Äù. It‚Äôs called red tortoise because it‚Äôs stable, wins races, and I just like the color red. For most of you out there ‚Äì there‚Äôs not much surprising stuff here, but if it informs anyone then I think its worth putting down."
