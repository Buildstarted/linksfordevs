    "Description": "I haven't seen much ink being spewed on the ZK update conflict issue so I'll write a short note here.\nLet's take a step back. Zero-knowledge proofs allow you to prove the result of the execution of some logic. Like signatures attached to data you receive, ZK proofs can be attached to a computation result. This means that with ZK, internet protocols can be rethought and redesigned. If execution of  ..."

    "Description": "Something that might not be immediately obvious if you're not used to zero-knowledgifying your applications, is that the provable circuits you end up using are pure functions. They do not have access to long-lasting memory and cannot have side effects. They just take some input, and produce some output.\n\nNote: circuits are actually not strictly pure, as they are non-deterministic. For example, you ..."
