Check.\nI opened a 1989 file. Well, all the lowercase \"a\"s are converted to circumflex characters, but I can work with that.\n\nI figured out (finally) how to search for dates on my Mac and found a story treatment named \"The Revenger\" (no extension, Mac naturally!). *The date is Mar 25, 1986.*\n\nIt opened with a few box characters, but otherwise readable. It looks like my attempt at an Andre Norton type SF space opera. It even opened \"Tree Castle\", which is or probably was a Mac Draw document. It was dated Jan 1, 1986. It's my oldest document. I've a screen cap below of the mentioned documents open in LibreOffice.\n\nYeah, for document conversion, LibreOffice rocks. The content of some of these old documents is amateurish; weird since I was already published. \n\nStill...  No lost IP.
