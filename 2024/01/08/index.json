Word can't read files prior to 1994.I finally got my links to my writing ironed out and content backed up into the cloud (what a pain), though it is in Time Machine, so I installed the newest Mac version of #LibreOffice.\n\nI opened a 1992 file. Check.\nI opened a 1989 file. Well, all the lowercase \"a\"s are converted to circumflex characters, but I can work with that.\n\nI figured out (finally) how to search for dates on my Mac and found a story treatment named \"The Revenger\" (no extension, Mac naturally!). *The date is Mar 25, 1986.*\n\nIt opened with a few box characters, but otherwise readable. It looks like my attempt at an Andre Norton type SF space opera. It even opened \"Tree Castle\", which is or probably was a Mac Draw document. It was dated Jan 1, 1986. It's my oldest document. I've a screen cap below of the mentioned documents open in LibreOffice.\n\nYeah, for document conversion, LibreOffice rocks. The content of some of these old documents is amateurish; weird since I was already published. \n\nStill...  No lost IP. This is a good thing.\n\ncc: @taur10@venera.social @alan@mindly.social \n\n#writing #writer #author #writersofmastodon #writingcommunity #fiction #writinglife #fiction #sf #ScienceFiction #spaceopera"
