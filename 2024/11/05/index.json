We now draw over 100 thousand live viewers and sponsor hundreds of local events around the world.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the three days we provide a wide selection of live sessions that feature speakers from the community and .NET team members. We have sessions streaming 24/7 between day two and three of the conference so everyone can get involved no matter what their time zone. You can ask questions live on Twitter, join the fun on Twitch, attend the virtual attendee parties where you can play trivia games and win prizes. Best of all, you can take what you learn here and be a better .NET developer.\r\n\r\nConnect with .NET: \r\nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\r\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\r\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\r\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\r\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\r\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\r\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\r\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\r\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\r\nüë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\r\n\r\n#dotnet #dotnetconf"

    "Description": "For many years now I‚Äôve been using a mental model and intuition that has guided me well for understanding and teaching and using functors, applicatives, monads, and other related Haskell abstractions, as well as for approaching learning new ones. Sometimes when teaching Haskell I talk about this concept and assume everyone already has heard it, but I realize that it‚Äôs something universal yet easy to miss depending on how you‚Äôre learning it. So, here it is: how I understand the Functor and other related abstractions and free constructions in Haskell. The crux is this: instead of thinking about what fmap changes, ask: what does fmap keep constant? This isn‚Äôt a rigorous understanding and isn‚Äôt going to explain every aspect about every Functor, and will probably only be useful if you already know a little bit about Functors in Haskell. But it‚Äôs a nice intuition trick that has yet to majorly mislead me."
