Sometimes when teaching Haskell I talk about this concept and assume everyone already has heard it, but I realize that it’s something universal yet easy to miss depending on how you’re learning it. So, here it is: how I understand the Functor and other related abstractions and free constructions in Haskell. The crux is this: instead of thinking about what fmap changes, ask: what does fmap keep constant? This isn’t a rigorous understanding and isn’t going to explain every aspect about every Functor, and will probably only be useful if you already know a little bit about Functors in Haskell. But it’s a nice intuition trick that has yet to majorly mislead me."
