You can now run the emulator in docker, locally, and point your application to the local instance. This will let you build an application that uses Azure Service Bus without relying on Azure during the development process!\n\nJoin me in this video where we explore this new tool, and set it up using .NET Aspire!\n\nTable of contents:\n00:00: Introduction\n02:15: Introducing Azure Service Bus Emulator\n03:35: Docker Compose\n05:00: Setting it up with Aspire\n05:30: Adding the container to Aspire\n06:00: Container to Container communication\n08:00: Azure Service Bus Emulator Running with Aspire\n08:24: Connect to the Service Bus\n\nFollow me on X: @fekberg   \nCheck out my courses on Pluralsight: https://pluralsight.pxf.io/d1MRK\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the links, I may receive a small commission."

I demonstrate two approaches for updating and deleting records: the traditional method that loads entities into memory and processes them using foreach loops, and the optimized bulk operation method. The difference? 6 seconds vs. 0.1 seconds!"

I can also use it to debug remote issues, as long as the user can send me a file."
