I never used a functional programming language (such as Haskell or OCaml) at work, but several ideas from functional programming have become popular in mainstream general-purpose programming languages such as Swift (which I mostly write). Often even a partially functional approach produces simpler code that’s easy to understand and quick to write and maintain. I’m always looking for good ideas I can adopt to write better code, whatever their source."
