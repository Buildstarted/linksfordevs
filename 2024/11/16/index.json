A single function gets broken into multiple smaller ones, and a single file becomes a collection of scattered files. It seems to believe this approach aligns with “industry best practices.”\nTake a simple task like sendMessage(user, message). Instead of keeping it straightforward, the AI splits it into a message builder, a message sender, message types, and so on—scattered across five or six files."
