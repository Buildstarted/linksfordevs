    "Description": "Recently due to various events (namely a lot of people getting off of\nX-Twitter), Bluesky has become a lot more\npopular, and excitement for its underlying protocol,\nATProto, is growing.\nSince I worked on\nActivityPub which connects\ntogether Mastodon,\nSharkey,\nPeertube,\nGotoSocial, etc, etc, etc in the present-day\nfediverse, I often get asked whether or not I have opinions about\nATProto vs ActivityPub, and the answer is that I do have opinions, but\nI am usually head-down focused on building what I hope to be the\nnext generation of decentralized (social) networking tech,\nand so I keep to myself about such things except in private channels."

    "Description": "Should a programming language be powerful and let a programmer do a lot, or should it be safe and protect the programmer from bad mistakes? Contrary to what the title insinuates, these are not diametrically opposed attributes. Nevertheless, this is the mindset that underlies notions such as, “macros, manual memory management, etc. are power tools—they’re not supposed to be safe.” If safety and power are not necessarily opposed, why does this notion persist?"
