    "Description": "Deploying modern web apps – with all the provisions needed to be fast and secure while easily updateable – has become so hard that many developers don’t dare do it without a PaaS (platform-as-a-service). But that’s ridiculous. Nobody should have to pay orders of magnitude more for basic computing just to make deployment friendly and usable. That’s a job for open source, and Rails 8 is ready to solve it. So it’s with great pleasure that we are now ready with the final version of Rails 8.0, after a successful beta release and several release candidates!"
