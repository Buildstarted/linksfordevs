In this session, Johnny will show you how to leverage your development skills and .NET 9 to combine data from external vendors by using their API's and be smart with that data to command your electric vehicle to charge when the time is right. Johnny even added some AI to the mix to be able to ask questions about the current charging state using Azure OpenAI for the LLM, Semantic Kernel to create a custom copilot, and Azure Cognitive Services for Speech-To-Text. This demo is not something that is put together for this talk, it is a cloud-native distributed application used by Johnny on a day-to-day basis.\n\nConnect with .NET: \nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\nüë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet"

This has become an important step for unified input \n            models where we have tokenized representations of text, images and other modalities present in a single sequence. These types of models are very prone to training instability without appropriate normalization, as the norms of the Q and K vectors can experience exponential growth during training. QKNorm is a necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) step to correct this problem."
