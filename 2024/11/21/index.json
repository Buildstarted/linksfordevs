    "Description": "Multimodality has led to some tweaks to the standard Transformer recipe. In this post we will cover QK Normalization (QKNorm), \n            where we apply normalization to the query and key vectors in the attention mechanism. This has become an important step for unified input \n            models where we have tokenized representations of text, images and other modalities present in a single sequence. These types of models are very prone to training instability without appropriate normalization, as the norms of the Q and K vectors can experience exponential growth during training. QKNorm is a necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) step to correct this problem."
