Let me show you exactly what you have been missing out on!\n\nDon‚Äôt let all the buzzwords scare you. It‚Äôs a lot easier than it may sound. Throughout this video we will explore the different parts of what makes .NET Aspire. How do you make it easier for a web frontend to discover an API? How do you easily add a Redis cache to an application, or any arbitrary docker container for that matter?\n\nNo matter if you can figure out how to get a complex solution running locally, making this process easier will save both time and money. \n\n.NET Aspire is really just a tool to make development easier. By providing a set of opinionated decisions, to introduce open telemetry, service discovery, http client configurations, and much more. All of this to make it a lot easier to run complex, and easy, solutions. Locally, or in the cloud! \n\nAt the end of this video, we will take it one step further from local development to get the entire stack published to the cloud, without a lot of work at all!\n\nWithout further ado, let‚Äôs learn about .NET Aspire!\nFollow me on X: @fekberg   \nCheck out my courses on Pluralsight: https://pluralsight.pxf.io/d1MRK\n\nDISCLAIMER: This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the links, I may receive a small commission."

Sadly, it is usually not the developers who decide whether these old .NET Framework applications will be modernized or not. How do you convince the management to allocate the budget for this task? What arguments and information should you present to stakeholders who do not have a technical background to ensure they understand the situation? In this session, I'll provide valuable tips and arguments I used in the past to advocate the necessity of modernization in various companies. I'll talk about estimating the effort of modernization and the long-term maintenance costs. I'll also go through the security risks and other benefits of the upgrade, such as improving the project's attractiveness for hiring new developers.\n\nConnect with .NET: \nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\nüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\nüë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet"
