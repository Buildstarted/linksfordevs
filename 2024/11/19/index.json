    "Description": "Most developers understand the benefits of migrating legacy apps to the new .NET and the risks of not doing so. Sadly, it is usually not the developers who decide whether these old .NET Framework applications will be modernized or not. How do you convince the management to allocate the budget for this task? What arguments and information should you present to stakeholders who do not have a technical background to ensure they understand the situation? In this session, I'll provide valuable tips and arguments I used in the past to advocate the necessity of modernization in various companies. I'll talk about estimating the effort of modernization and the long-term maintenance costs. I'll also go through the security risks and other benefits of the upgrade, such as improving the project's attractiveness for hiring new developers.\n\nConnect with .NET: \nBlog:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog\nTwitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter\nTikTok:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok\nMastodon:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon\nLinkedIn:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin\nFacebook:  https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook\nDocs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet\nForums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums\n🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa\n👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet"
