    "Description": "Suppose you are tasked with designing a data structure consisting of values that can be compared with one another, and that this data structure must support two operations: insertion and lookup. At any moment, you may either be given a value and asked to insert it into your structure, or given a value and asked to say whether it is already present in your structure. The \"computational complexity\" of these two operations will be evaluated purely in terms of how many comparison operations they carry out on the provided data, so you don't need to worry about memory complexity, time complexity, or anything like that. Think of this problem as being analogous to a balance puzzle."
