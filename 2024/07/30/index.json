I used to lean heavily into full-digital notes, but I started drifting towards a mixture of digital and hand-written notes. Initially it was complicated, but I think I’m converging on a good setup. What I describe here will continue to evolve I am sure, but I am enjoying where it’s currently at."

This\nblog post builds on previous work, like Kathryn McKinley’s seminal\npost\n[1]\nand on Kate Manne’s books Down\nGirl [2] and\nEntitled [3], which frame\nmisogyny through the lens of moral philosophy."
