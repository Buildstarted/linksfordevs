This year, technologies such as JavaScript and PostgreSQL remain most popular, Rust and Markdown remain most admired, developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work, and they don’t see AI as a threat to their jobs. Themes we see in this year’s survey results show us that developers are not threatened by AI, and developers are most frustrated by technical debt at work. On the topic of AI, 76% of respondents shared they are using or planning to use AI tools, but only 43% said they trust the accuracy of AI tools and 45% believe AI tools struggle to handle complex tasks."

Over these discussions, which also led to some research collaboration as well, we realized that (one of the central concepts from linear algebra that is used frequently in practice, if not every day, was) the central concepts from linear algebra invoked frequently in practice, if not every day, were projection, and consequently singular value decomposition (SVD) as well as even less frequently positive definiteness. Unfortunately, we noticed that existing courses on linear algebra often focus much more on the invertibility (or lack thereof), to the point that many concepts are introduced not in the order of their practicality nor usefulness but in the order of the conveniences in mathematical derivations/introductions. We began to wonder a lot whether we can introduce concepts and results in linear algebra in a radically different way."
