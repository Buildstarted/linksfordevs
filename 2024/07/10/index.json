    "Description": "Recently, a colleague checked out Gleam’s language tour. They liked what they saw, but they were confused by Gleam’s use syntax. I like Gleam’s syntax a lotI even wrote an article about Gleam’s syntax., but I was also confused by use when I first encountered it. Here’s how I use use:The use expression was introduced in Gleam v0.25, as a more general replacement for the try keyword that preceded it."

    "Description": "This page is intended to be a sort of liner notes for my contributions to Spore.  It's a place for me to write up miscellaneous development comments about the parts of the game I worked on, while they're still fresh in my mind.  I think the game had over 80 people working on it towards the end, and it was in development for more than 5 years, so basically everything in the game was touched by more than one person and was a team effort.  Given that, I will strive for inclusion and accuracy, and I will only talk about systems to which I made substantial contributions.  If I've left somebody out or made a mistake, I apologize; please email me and I'll correct it immediately."

The ease of it all seemed normal to me. Make a life in a new country? No big deal. As I grew up, I realized this wasn’t far from the truth for most of the developed world. If you’re in a Western country and dead set on becoming a citizen of another, is it really that hard? Not really.\nThis is the world we created after World War II. We asked for peace and open borders. Now we’re surprised when people use them?"

Besides the fact that this is just an easy way to avoid a discussion (because everyone interprets this differently), it is just plain wrong."

This situation can worsen over time, as certain high-profile dependencies become outdated or discontinued, preventing the update of interlocked dependencies and leading to a cascade of technological stagnation. Eventually, this can reach a critical point, requiring big bang migrations to break free from the constraints of problematic legacy technologies."
