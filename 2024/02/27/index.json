    "Description": "The other day I happened upon a post by Chris Barrick detailing how to encode a tic-tac-toe game state in 15 bits, itself a response to an earlier post by Alejandra González detailing how to encode a tic-tac-toe state in 18 bits. In their posts, Chris and Alejandra mention 10 bits as the absolute minimum, since there are only 765 possible game states. This number, however, takes mirroring and rotations into account1, while Chris’ and Alejandra’s solutions do not. If you include mirrorings and rotations, the number of states jumps to 5477 that gives us a theoretical minimum of \\(\\left\\lceil{\\log_2{5477}}\\right\\rceil=\\left\\lceil{12.419...}\\right\\rceil=13\\) bits. For physicists, the difference between 13 and 15 might look negligible, but hey, consuming 15% more space is no joke. The 765 figure considers the following two boards (and a few others) as the same state: ↩"

After a quick search, I reviewed four solutions: DeepL Write, Hemingway, LanguageTool, and Grammarly. Another alternative I didn't explore was running an LLM locally or on a server because of the hardware requirements. Let's explore what problems I'm trying to solve, the level of privacy and security I can expect from these tools, and how well they perform according to my subjective gut feeling."

Spoiler: it’s not really possible, but the why is kinda interesting, so I thought I’d write a post talking about it, and why it’s honestly not a big loss at this stage."
