It‚Äôs essentially a filter on this list of posts, but to the user it seems like he navigates separate pages with a list of posts for each tag, that is, these ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù tag pages have their own heading, you can link to them, and use the back and forward buttons in the browser as expected. The advantage is that you don‚Äôt need to generate a separate static page for each tag, and the user doesn‚Äôt need to load a new page for each tag, so jumping from one tag to another is fast.1"

    "Description": "The USN‚Äôs supercarriers are extremely capable, but also very expensive, and even the USN can only afford a few.  As a result, every few years, the suggestion of building smaller, cheaper carriers comes up.  In recent years, these have gotten louder, driven in large part by the development of the F-35B, which can operate without the need for catapults or arresting gear and offers capability unmatched outside the F-35 family.  There have even been tests with USS America, normally an amphibious helicopter carrier, serving as a ‚ÄúLightning Carrier‚Äù.  Unfortunately, there are serious practical problems with all of this.  The simple fact is that there are major economies of scale in carrier aviation, and STOVL isn‚Äôt going to remove them, nor is something like America, lovely though she is, a good substitute for the CVNs."
