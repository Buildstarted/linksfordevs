As a result, every few years, the suggestion of building smaller, cheaper carriers comes up.  In recent years, these have gotten louder, driven in large part by the development of the F-35B, which can operate without the need for catapults or arresting gear and offers capability unmatched outside the F-35 family.  There have even been tests with USS America, normally an amphibious helicopter carrier, serving as a ‚ÄúLightning Carrier‚Äù.  Unfortunately, there are serious practical problems with all of this.  The simple fact is that there are major economies of scale in carrier aviation, and STOVL isn‚Äôt going to remove them, nor is something like America, lovely though she is, a good substitute for the CVNs."

    "Description": "In the past (in fact two years ago, proof I have been doing this for a while\nnow!) I wrote\nabout\nthe \"inconvenient truth\" that structural aspects of the Internet make truly\ndecentralized systems infeasible, due to the lack of a means to perform\nbroadcast discovery. As a result, most distributed systems rely on a set of\ncentral, semi-static nodes to perform initial introductions."
