    "Description": "Since its inception, Forgejo (a self-hosted git forge, like GitHub) has been a soft fork of Gitea. Upgrading to it was - and for the time being, remains to be - as simple as changing the URL from which the release is downloaded. Over time, the way Forgejo is governed and developed evolved. To be able to provide stable, secure, reliable releases, Forgejo requires a reasonable effort made at writing tests for each change that goes into the code. This has worked out remarkably well, as it caught both regressions in imported code, and mistakes in proposed changes. Furthermore, Forgejo has accepted features and other changes that are not available in Gitea, and has diverged in other ways already."
