Thus, inauthenticity.\nThat line of thinking and mindset led me to be single for a long time, and since then I‚Äôve always paid attention to how I communicate and how I might communicate better. Coming from a nerdy, introverted, engineering background, it has taken me some time to reach my somewhat adequate level of socialization, but I‚Äôm enthusiastic to inform the reader that a psychologist friend recently dubbed me ‚Äúalmost certainly not autistic‚Äù üòéüëç"

    "Description": "Why should we care so much about naming as developers? Code comes and goes, but language prevails. When a team is working on a project, they must develop a shared language on how things work, how they are structured, and how they are related. A database schema or language specification is such an important document that many developers will battle passionately over what columns are called. Mental models of how things go together are at odds when there are multiple words to describe the same thing."
