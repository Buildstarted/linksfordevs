More importantly, they offer advanced analysis, such as differentiating between time spent on the lift and actual skiing. However, they rely on GPS data instead of utilising the phone's internal sensors, which provide more precise data. Could a machine learning model provide more accurate analysis by relying on sensor data?"

This is so I can output a binary file, ready for execution, instead of depending on an external compiler like GCC to do that last step. As a first step, I've hand-generated, byte-by-byte, a small ELF file that can be run on a 64-bit x86-64 Linux installation."
