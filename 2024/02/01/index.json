    "Description": "RavenDB is a document database which claims to offer ACID transactions, including Snapshot Isolation by default and Serializability with the strongest settings. Following the documentation‚Äôs claim that a session ‚Äúrepresents a single business transaction,‚Äù we tested RavenDB 6.0.2 and found surprising behavior even in healthy, single-node clusters. Transactions lose updates by default. Both the optimistic concurrency and cluster-wide transaction modes allow fractured read: a serious anomaly forbidden by Snapshot Isolation and several weaker consistency models. Alternatively, RavenDB may not have interactive transactions at all. This work was performed independently without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy."
