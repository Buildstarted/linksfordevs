Serving LLMs with common prefix could be memory and time-consuming, especially when common prefix is long and the number of requests is large: a possible use case is long document QA (Figure 1), multiple users interacts with ChatBot with the same document as prompt. While vLLM alleviate the memory issue by only storing one copy of the common prefix. However, it still suffers from the low-efficiency because the default PageAttention implementation do not optimize KV-Cache access to the shared prompt."

The conversation also digs into the complexity of metadata with headers and trailers and the challenges of supporting multiple platforms and multiple type systems - but it works if you take the time to learn the details. And the results are fast and flexible communications!"
