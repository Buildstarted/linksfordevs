While A/B testing is a valuable tool, this post challenges the assumption of exchangeability between past and future data, emphasizing the dynamic nature of the business environment. I propose two solutions (1) validating the exchangeability assumption through holdback groups and (2) advocating for a holistic decision-making approach that goes beyond statistical tests. Executives are urged not to blindly trust p-values, emphasizing the importance of intuition, market understanding, and forecasting in shaping successful business strategies. In conclusion, the post encourages a balanced approach, combining statistical rigor with real-world insights for effective decision-making."
