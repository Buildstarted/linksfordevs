But I wasn't really in the mood to go through the same old steps which I had explained in this post earlier. I was complaining about this to my colleague, and there came the suggestion of why not copy the entire disk to the new laptop. Though it sounded like an interesting idea to me, I had my doubts, so here is what I told him in return."

    "Description": "The team is thrilled to introduce the much-anticipated release of Kdenlive 24.02, featuring a substantial upgrade to our frameworks with the adoption of Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6. This significant under-the-hood transformation establishes a robust foundation, shaping the trajectory of Kdenlive for the next decade. The benefits of this upgrade are particularly noteworthy for Linux users, as improved Wayland support enhances the overall experience. Additionally, users on Windows, MacOS, and Linux will experience a substantial performance boost since Kdenlive now runs natively on DirectX, Metal, and Vulkan respectively, replacing the previous abstraction layer reliance on OpenGL and Angle, resulting in a more efficient and responsive application. This upgrade brings significant changes to packaging, featuring the introduction of a dedicated package for Apple Silicon, the discontinuation of PPA support and an enhanced method for installing the Whisper and Vosk speech-to-text engines."

However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension, is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space Telescope‚Äôs keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble‚Äôs measurements."
