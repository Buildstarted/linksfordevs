    "Description": "Webb measurements shed new light on a decade-long mystery.The rate at which the Universe is expanding, known as the Hubble constant, is one of the fundamental parameters for understanding the evolution and ultimate fate of the cosmos. However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension, is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space Telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s measurements."

    "Description": "The original ANSI C standard, C89, introduced the concept of “undefined behavior,”\nwhich was used both to describe the effect of outright bugs like\naccessing memory in a freed object\nand also to capture the fact that existing implementations differed about\nhandling certain aspects of the language,\nincluding use of uninitialized values,\nsigned integer overflow, and null pointer handling."
