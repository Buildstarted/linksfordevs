    "Description": "Have you tried adding a .gif to your .NET MAUI application, but only see a still image and wonder why it doesn't animate? ü§î Well, today you will discover how to solve this quickly and easily! üöÄ‚ú®\n\nLet's start!\nGIFs are made up of a series of images that create a silent, repetitive animation. Adding a .gif to your application involves the same steps as adding a normal image (PNG for example). However, these require an extra step to play their animation. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to add it and configure the properties necessary for its playback.\n1Ô∏è‚É£. Add your animation to the Images folder. Once added, right-click on the newly added file and select: Build Action ‚û°Ô∏è ¬†MauiImage.\n\n\n\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£. Alright, it's time to animate your image in code! üåü You can use the Images element like you usually would for common formats (like PNG for example). The only difference is you need to add the IsAnimationPlaying property with true as value.\nWhat exactly is IsAnimationPlaying?\nThis property determines if the animation in the .gif will play. It accepts a bool value. By default, it's set to False, meaning if you don't specify otherwise, your .gif won't play.\nLet's explore how to convert this into code:\n\nAnd now, I'll show you an example of a .gif, incorporating the points explained above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüö´ Limitations\n‚ûñ Although .NET MAUI supports downloading animated GIFs, it does not support caching or streaming of these files.\n\nAnd our GIF is alive! \nThanks for reading! üëã See you next time! üíöüíï\n\nSpanish article: https://es.askxammy.com/problemas-al-cargar-un-gif-en-net-maui/\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/image?view=net-maui-8.0\n"

The\nnews is unwelcome, but not entirely unexpected. What is unusual with this situation is\nthe number of Redis alternatives to choose from; there are at least\nfour options to choose as a replacement for those who wish to stay\nwith free software, including a pre-existing fork called KeyDB and the Linux Foundation's newly-announced Valkey project. The question now is which one(s)\nLinux distributions, users, and providers will choose to take its place."
