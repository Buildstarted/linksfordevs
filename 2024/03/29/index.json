    "Domain": "research.myshell.ai",
    "Description": "We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile instant voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. OpenVoice also achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. The technical report and source code can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf and https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice"

    "Description": "Have you tried adding a .gif to your .NET MAUI application, but only see a still image and wonder why it doesn't animate? ü§î Well, today you will discover how to solve this quickly and easily! üöÄ‚ú®\n\nLet's start!\nGIFs are made up of a series of images that create a silent, repetitive animation. Adding a .gif to your application involves the same steps as adding a normal image (PNG for example). However, these require an extra step to play their animation. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to add it and configure the properties necessary for its playback.\n1Ô∏è‚É£. Add your animation to the Images folder. Once added, right-click on the newly added file and select: Build Action ‚û°Ô∏è ¬†MauiImage.\n\n\n\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£. Alright, it's time to animate your image in code! üåü You can use the Images element like you usually would for common formats (like PNG for example). The only difference is you need to add the IsAnimationPlaying property with true as value.\nWhat exactly is IsAnimationPlaying?\nThis property determines if the animation in the .gif will play. It accepts a bool value. By default, it's set to False, meaning if you don't specify otherwise, your .gif won't play.\nLet's explore how to convert this into code:\n\nAnd now, I'll show you an example of a .gif, incorporating the points explained above!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüö´ Limitations\n‚ûñ Although .NET MAUI supports downloading animated GIFs, it does not support caching or streaming of these files.\n\nAnd our GIF is alive! \nThanks for reading! üëã See you next time! üíöüíï\n\nSpanish article: https://es.askxammy.com/problemas-al-cargar-un-gif-en-net-maui/\nReference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/image?view=net-maui-8.0\n"
