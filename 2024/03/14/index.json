That’s step 1 above.\nBut, customers are pushing for a deeper separation of compute & storage. The recent Snowflake earnings call highlighted the trend. Larger customers prefer open formats for interoperability (step 2 & 3).\nA lot of big customers want to have open file formats to give them the options…So data interoperability is very much a thing and our AI products can generally act on data that is sitting in cloud storage as well."
