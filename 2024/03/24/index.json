While math wasn't\n            the focus of that project, I saw several flaws in the model being\n            able to learn math at all, from dataset to tokenizer. This time, I\n            worked with minimal sized transformers from the ground up, to prove\n            that they can learn math, and if you're model can't, its\n            just a you skill issue."
