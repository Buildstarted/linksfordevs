When multiple tests modify/access the same piece of state, in order to ensure the tests don’t interfere with each other, we need to serialize the tests using async: false.\nTo isolate tests from each other and avoid async: false, here we explore a technique for “localizing” global state. That is, we reduce the scope of in-memory state such that each ExUnit test has its own private copy of the state. With global state thus localized, our ExUnit tests are decoupled and safe for async: true."
