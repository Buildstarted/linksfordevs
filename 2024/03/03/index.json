    "Description": "CS 6120 is a PhD-level Cornell CS course by Adrian Sampson on programming language implementation.\nIt covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.\nThe work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class."

    "Description": "Modern large language models (like ChatGPT) learn to generate new samples by modeling the data distribution of natural text. However, the underlying methodology has largely remained stagnant over the last century: although different architectures have been developed, models are all based on autoregressive modeling (i.e. next token prediction). In this blog post, I will talk about our work on Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models, an alternative probablistic modeling technique that achieves highly competitive performance (at the scale of GPT-2) while introducing distinct algorithmic benefits. Our empirical results challenge the longstanding dominance of autoregressive modeling and can potentially pave the way for an alternative class of language models built from radically different principles."

It’s admirable and ambitious, but I generally avoid this issue because a) I have no viable solution to offer, and b) I don’t believe anyone else has one either. When it comes to growing the amateur radio service, I’m a fatalist. I believe ham radio will shrink until it’s gone. Given that, looking for solutions are a waste of my time."
