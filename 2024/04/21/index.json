    "Description": "All the “C++ killers”, even these which I wholeheartedly love and respect like Rust, Julia, and D, help you write more features with fewer bugs, but they don't much help when you need to squeeze the very last FLOPS from the hardware you rent. As such, they don’t have a competitive advantage over C++. Or, for that matter, even over each other. Most of them, for instance, Rust, Julia, and Clang even share the same backend. You can’t win a car race if you all share the same car. So, which technologies do hold a competitive advantage over C++ or, speaking generally, all the traditional ahead-of-time compilers?"
