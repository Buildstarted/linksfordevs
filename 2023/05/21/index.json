    "Description": "It's been a hectic past few months for the project. In addition to the upcoming release on Steam, a lot of focus has gone into other major features. While not everything has landed yet, two very important changes to Android did arrive, one of which has been in the works for a couple years!\nWe're talking about a large scale rewrite to Dolphin's Android Input Handling that will eventually allow it to match the feature set users on Desktop Dolphin builds enjoy. Android users also get another major quality of life upgrade - Dolphin now is now a Document Provider on Android. This means you can use Dolphin to directly copy files into and out of its per-app directory on the latest versions of Android.\nIn this report, we'll be going through both of these and several other important changes. Enjoy!"

    "Description": "I started programming in Rust several years ago, and it has gradually changed the way I design programs in other programming languages, most notably in Python. Before I started using Rust, I was usually writing Python code in a very dynamic and type-loose way, without type hints, passing and returning dictionaries everywhere, and occasionally falling back to ‚Äústringly-typed‚Äù interfaces. However, after experiencing the strictness of the Rust type system, and noticing all the problems that it prevents ‚Äúby construction‚Äù, I suddenly became quite anxious whenever I got back to Python and wasn‚Äôt provided with the same guarantees."
