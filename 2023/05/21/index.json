    "Description": "Introduction Link to heading Varint is a widely recognized technique used for compressing integer streams. Essentially, it suggests that it can be more efficient to encode a number using a variable-length representation instead of a fixed-size binary representation. By removing leading zeros from the binary number, the overall representation size can be reduced. This technique works particularly well for encoding smaller numbers.\nIn this article, I provide a brief introduction and rationale for varint encoding."

While not everything has landed yet, two very important changes to Android did arrive, one of which has been in the works for a couple years!\nWe're talking about a large scale rewrite to Dolphin's Android Input Handling that will eventually allow it to match the feature set users on Desktop Dolphin builds enjoy. Android users also get another major quality of life upgrade - Dolphin now is now a Document Provider on Android. This means you can use Dolphin to directly copy files into and out of its per-app directory on the latest versions of Android.\nIn this report, we'll be going through both of these and several other important changes. Enjoy!"

Before I started using Rust, I was usually writing Python code in a very dynamic and type-loose way, without type hints, passing and returning dictionaries everywhere, and occasionally falling back to “stringly-typed” interfaces. However, after experiencing the strictness of the Rust type system, and noticing all the problems that it prevents “by construction”, I suddenly became quite anxious whenever I got back to Python and wasn’t provided with the same guarantees."
