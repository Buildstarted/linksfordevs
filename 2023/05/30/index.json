Although the einstein problem was answered, in some contexts (e.g., tile floors), you'd likely have to manufacture two separate tiles.  Our paper left open the question of whether a shape could tile aperiodically using translations and rotations only, with no reflections.\n\nI hate to sound like a broken record, but then, on March 26th, Dave noticed something interesting.

In this paper we \npresent the first true aperiodic monotile, a shape that forces \naperiodicity through geometry alone, with no additional constraints\napplied via matching conditions.  We prove that this shape, a polykite\nthat we call \"the hat\", must assemble into tilings based on a substitution\nsystem.  The drawing above shows a patch of hats produced using a few\nrounds of substitution."
