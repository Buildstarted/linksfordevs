Always tunnel TCP over UDP when you can. In rare cases, overly restrictive firewalls may block UDP traffic, in which case you should obfuscate the tunnel‚Äôs UDP traffic as TCP to bypass restrictions. The adoption of UDP-based QUIC will make more internet traffic be on UDP, forcing firewalls to be less restrictive towards UDP traffic."
