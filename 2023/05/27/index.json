F*, developed by Microsoft Research, is agroundbreaking functional language that combines dependent types andproof-oriented features. By bridging the gap between programming andproving, F* facilitates a gradual adoption of formal methods bysoftware engineers. In this post, I will provide an introduction to thebasics of F* and demonstrate how we can leverage itscapabilities to verify a solution to a LeetCode problem. I can’t coverall the background material needed to understand F* in this post. Iassume that you have some experience in a language like Haskell orOCaml."
