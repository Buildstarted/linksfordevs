    "Description": "As more opportunities arise in the world around us, it becomes increasingly complex. We often find ourselves so overwhelmed by the growing influx of information that we try to avoid complexity. At the same time, for many people, one of the most enjoyable experiences is when something completely incomprehensible just a second ago suddenly becomes clear. Drawing on scientific research, the concept of emptiness in Buddhism, and observations of the infinite diversity of the world, we will dive into the beauty of complexity using thought-provoking analogies. By examining its role in our lives and its influence on our understanding of the universe, we can better recognize the deep interconnectedness of the world around us. And I will try to write about complexity simply.\n"

If you want to remove the server header, you'll find that the process for IIS is different than for the internally created Kestrel header and you can't use the same approach to remove the header as with Kestrel applications. In this post I discuss why the header behaves differently in IIS and how to remove it regardless of ASP.NET version."
