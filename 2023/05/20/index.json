    "Description": " Most software applications today are built around the concept of multi-tenancy.\nOne application serves multiple customers, while keeping their data isolated.\nYou can approach multi-tenancy in two ways: - Single database & logical isolation of tenants - Multiple databases & physical isolation of tenants\nWhich option you decide to use will depend mostly on your requirements. Some industries like healthcare require a high degree of data isolation, and using a database per tenant is a must.\nSo how are we going to implement multi-tenancy support with EF Core?\nWe can use Query Filters to apply a tenant filter to all database queries.\nImplement it once, and you can almost forget about it."
