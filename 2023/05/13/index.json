    "Description": "I was domainless a few months ago. Being domainless means you don't understand some things about domains. I used to think a custom email address was an automatic perk of owning a domain, since most cool programmers I noticed had an email that seemed to spawn from their website's URL (brad [at] bradwoods.io, joel [at] joelonsoftware.com, jozef [at] legeny.fr, etc). And once I set up a domain / personal website, it was almost magical, like - poof - now I own this web address on the internet, bought with real money, and it should come with an email address for the internet too."

The feature of automatic scaling is a novel way to expand the capacity of your web applications and App Service Plans without having to make scaling decisions yourself. It differs from the existing Azure autoscale, which allows you to specify scaling rules according to schedules and resources. With automatic scaling, you can modify scaling settings to enhance your application’s performance and prevent delays in starting up. This Automatic scaling feature is in preview. And it is available for Premium Pv2 and Pv3 pricing tiers, and supported for all app types: Windows, Linux, and Windows container."
