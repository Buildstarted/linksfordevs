    "Description": " Software architecture diagrams are a great way to communicate how you are planning to build a software system or how an existing software system works.\nHowever, the majority of software architecture diagrams I've seen are a total mess.\nIf only there was a standard way to visualize your software architecture...\nEnter the C4 model, which stands for context, containers, components, and code.\nThe C4 model is a lightweight approach to describing your software architecture.\nAnd it's essentially just two things, a predefined set of common abstractions and four diagram types: - Context diagram - high-level view of the system - Container diagram - shows the objects running inside a system - Component diagram - shows the building blocks that make each container - Code diagram - rarely used, typically UML or ER diagram\nLet's see how we can use the C4 model to visualize our software architecture."

    "Description": "This post is about configuring automatic scaling in Azure App Service. Automatic scaling is a new feature available in Azure App Service scale out configuration. The feature of automatic scaling is a novel way to expand the capacity of your web applications and App Service Plans without having to make scaling decisions yourself. It differs from the existing Azure autoscale, which allows you to specify scaling rules according to schedules and resources. With automatic scaling, you can modify scaling settings to enhance your application’s performance and prevent delays in starting up. This Automatic scaling feature is in preview. And it is available for Premium Pv2 and Pv3 pricing tiers, and supported for all app types: Windows, Linux, and Windows container."
