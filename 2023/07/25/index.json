First thing I did was minimise a window and there was just this black square. Bit by bit roaches slowly moved. Like 0.5 fps. So many xroaches under his xterm that it was just a solid black square. \n\nThe roaches multiply if they’re left alone long enough. This professor NEVER moved windows. So roaches scurried under his windows and then sat there. Never disturbed by being exposed. Slowly multiplying at some rate. Some grad student had thought it would be funny to play a prank on the professor and run xroach on him. But the professor obviously never saw the roaches. So they hid under his windows slowly increasing until finally they soaked up so much RAM that it impaired performance."
