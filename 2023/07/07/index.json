    "Description": "I've just finished giving a session of our [Advanced Rust training](https://training.ocamlpro.com/en/formation-rust-vocational-2022.html) at `$DAYJOB`. Overall I felt confident, the trainees were actively participating, and I think I could answer most of the questions I was asked accurately and helpfully. There is, however, one thing I'm frustrated I could not answer properly. The one question they kept coming back with was: \"How do we know what is a good or bad way to express <pattern> in Rust?\". "
