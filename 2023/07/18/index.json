Mike is now one of the all-time leading contributors to the official ASP.NET forums at  and is also a moderator there. &nbsp; As a result of his contributions to the ASP.NET community via the forums, and through his technical article site at , Mike received the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for ASP.NET from 2008 to 2018.

[5:42] Jeffrey and his son are programming their own video game! [7:17] What sparked his interest in Razor and writing his new book, ? [9:51] What is the framework that Mike uses in his day-to-day job? [10:37] How would Mike classify the types of websites or web applications that are perfect for Razor pages, and maybe had some difficulties with other frameworks? [14:16] Are there any commonalities that you lose if you do the application with Razor pages and not MVC? [16:32] How does Mike organize his feature folders? [18:12] How Mike organizes test libraries and test cases. [20:06] What has been Mike‚Äôs experience with ? [21:02] What‚Äôs coming in the future of Razor and Blazor?
