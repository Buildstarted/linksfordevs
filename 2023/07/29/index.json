Thank you, everyone, for responding to the poll on the no-GIL proposal. It’s clear that the overall sentiment is positive, both for the general idea and for PEP 703 specifically. The Steering Council is also largely positive on both. We intend to accept PEP 703, although we’re still working on the acceptance details.  As we’ve done a few times in the past, we ..."

The Online Safety Bill, now at the final stage before passage in the House of Lords, gives the British government the ability to force backdoors into messaging services, which will destroy end-to-end encryption. No amendments have been accepted that would mitigate the bill’s most dangerous elements. If it passes, the Online Safety Bill will be a huge step backwards for global privacy, and democracy itself."

    "Description": " I've been using Clean Architecture for 6+ years on large scale applications serving thousands of customers and millions of requests. Today I want to talk about why it's a great approach for structuring your applications.\nI'm aware that Clean Architecture isn't a silver bullet, so I will discuss what types of systems can benefit from this architecture.\nClean architecture isn't revolutionary.\nBut it's prescriptive about how you should structure the code.\nIt's an evolution of the layered architecture, focusing on the core domain and the direction of dependencies. All dependencies should point inwards, applying dependency inversion.\nHere are some of the promises of Clean Architecture: - Maintainability - Testability - Loose coupling - Separation of concerns\nIt's independent of UI, databases, or external services - but you also need to be pragmatic (more on this later).\nLet's dive in."
