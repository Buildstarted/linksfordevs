It occurred to me that the chance of\nseeing the same faces should somehow scale with the number of people going to\nthe gym, hence it may be possible to estimate the total number of gym members\nfrom the number of people I repeatedly see. I then realised that sounds very\nmuch like a\nmark and recapture (MR)\nexperiment from Ecology, so I did a little bit of research to see how difficult\nit would be to estimate the gym members using MR techniques."
