So please bear with me as I commit that exact sin: let me present the case for why prompting should be called prompt design and be likened to web design.\nI view prompting as communicating with a time-constrained human. While LLM-specific techniques are certainly helpful (most notably chain-of-thought), I&rsquo;ve found that one of the best ways to improve performance is to just have extremely clear and high-quality instructions, similarly to how clarity and conciseness helps real humans understand better too."
