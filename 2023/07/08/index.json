    "Description": " Large Microservice-based systems can consist of tens or even hunders of individual services. A client application needs to have all of this information to be able to make requests to the relevant microservice directly.\nHowever, this has numerous issues such as security concerns, complexity, and coupling.\nWe can solve this by introducing an API gateway that acts as a reverse proxy to accept API calls from the client application, forwarding this traffic to the appropriate service.\nThe API gateway also enforces security and ensures scalability and high availability.\nIn this week's newsletter, I'll show you how to implement an API gateway using the YARP reverse proxy.\nHere's what we will cover: - Difference between API gateway and reverse proxy - Installing and configuring YARP - Creating an API gateway with YARP - Authentication and rate limiting on the API gateway\nLet's get started."
