A fan of gadgets and all things technology, when he isn’t found behind the clickety clack of his favorite mechanical keyboard he’s usually found riding a bicycle on his favorite road or trail systems. A father of two boys, Michael often spends his free time teaching his boys how to lose with dignity as they destroy him in game franchises like Overwatch, Halo, and Call of Duty. When not sharing his love of Git, C#, and unit testing, he can be found spending his “study time” studying the sounds of guitar and music theory."
