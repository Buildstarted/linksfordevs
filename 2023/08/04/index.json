    "Description": "Recently, Sukbae Lee et al. reported inspiring experimental findings on the\natmospheric superconductivity of a modified lead apatite crystal (LK-99) at\nroom temperature (10.6111/JKCGCT.2023.33.2.061, arXiv: 2307.12008, arXiv:\n2307.12037). They claimed that the synthesized LK-99 materials exhibit the\nMeissner levitation phenomenon of superconductors and have a superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) higher than 400 K. Here, for the first time, we\nsuccessfully verify and synthesize the LK-99 crystals which can be magnetically\nlevitated with larger levitated angle than Sukbae Lee's sample at room\ntemperature. It is expected to realize the true potential of room temperature,\nnon-contact superconducting magnetic levitation in near future."
