    "Description": " Rate limiting is about restricting the number of requests to your application. It's usually applied within a specific time window or based on some other criteria.\nRate limiting is practical for a few reasons: - Improves security - Guards against DDoS attacks - Prevents overloading of application servers - Reduces costs by preventing unnecessary resource consumption\nBut you need to know how to implement it correctly, or you could grind your system to a halt.\nIn this week's newsletter I'll teach you: - How to rate limit users by IP address - How to rate limit users by their identity - How to apply rate limiting on the reverse proxy\nSo let's dive in."
