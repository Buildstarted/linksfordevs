One of those challenges is designing effective communication between services.\nMore centralization or less centralization? More coupling or less coupling? More control or less control?\nThese are only a few questions you need to answer.\nIn this week's newsletter, we will:\n- Break down Orchestration vs. Choreography - Understand key differences and tradeoffs between them - Create a framework for deciding which approach to use\nLet's dive in!"
