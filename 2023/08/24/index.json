    "Description": "Haiku uses a custom vector image format to store icons. This is surprising both because most OSes consider bitmaps to be totally sufficient to represent icons and because there are plenty of vector graphics formats out this (e.g. SVG). The goal of the Haiku Vector Icon Format (HVIF) is to make vector icon files as small as possible. This allows Haiku to display icons as several sizes while still keeping the files small enough to fit into an inode (i.e., inside a file‚Äôs metadata). The goal of keeping the icons in the metadata is to reduce the disk reads needed to display a folder ‚Äì it allows each file to only require one disk read to display."
