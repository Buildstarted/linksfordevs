    "Description": " Dapper is a lightweight object-relational mapper in .NET. It's popular because it's easy to use and fast at the same time.\nDapper extends the IDbConnection interface with methods for sending SQL queries to the database.\nBut, because of the nature of SQL, mapping the result into an object model can be tricky.\nSo in this week's newsletter, I'll teach you how to map: - Simple queries - One-to-one relationships - One-to-many relationships - Many-to-many relationships\nLet's dive in."
