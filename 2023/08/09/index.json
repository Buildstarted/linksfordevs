The most important lesson that I learned from it was that when I’m in\nan unfamiliar environment, I should prefer to build a minimum viable system by\ndeveloping things vertically instead of horizontally. That means building just a\nportion of a layer and then moving to the next layer as quickly as possible.\nRather than building out entire layers sequentially. Connecting the pieces of a\nsystem can be surprisingly challenging, which means that if I leave it to the\nend, I can run into unexpected issues and slowdowns."
