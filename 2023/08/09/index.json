The most important lesson that I learned from it was that when I’m in\nan unfamiliar environment, I should prefer to build a minimum viable system by\ndeveloping things vertically instead of horizontally. That means building just a\nportion of a layer and then moving to the next layer as quickly as possible.\nRather than building out entire layers sequentially. Connecting the pieces of a\nsystem can be surprisingly challenging, which means that if I leave it to the\nend, I can run into unexpected issues and slowdowns."

    "Description": "Statusbar controls are boring, but because of the way that they are used there are a number of caveats like ensuring the UI updates even in linear code, allowing for timeouts of status messages and resetting to default, and to provide some visual clues to draw attention to the status messages displayed. In this post I talk about a custom status bar control and helper that make it super easy to use a new status bar control or attach additional functionality to an existing status bar."
