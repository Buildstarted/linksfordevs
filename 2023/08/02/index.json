    "Description": "A recent paper [Lee {\u001bm et al.}, J. Korean Cryt. Growth Cryst. Techn. {\bf\n33}, 61 (2023)] provides some experimental indications that\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O with $x\u0007pprox 1$, coined LK-99, might be a\nroom-temperature superconductor at ambient pressure. Our density-functional\ntheory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with $x$\n-- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu$^{2+}$ in\na $3d^9$ configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi\nenergy. This puts Pb$_{9}$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O in an ultra-correlated regime and\nsuggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If\ndoped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or\nan correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without\nsuperconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results."
