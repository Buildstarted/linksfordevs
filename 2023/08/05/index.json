    "Description": "One of the more complex parts of building an application is getting navigation to work. In a Windows application (or in a multi-platform application using the Uno Platform) you can easily navigate between pages using Frame.Navigate and Frame.GoBack but what if you want to use a more complex navigation structure like tabs or a NavigationView. ...

    "Description": " Modular monoliths are becoming more popular in the software engineering community.\nThe allure of Microservices is becoming less compelling. We also have seasoned veterans of our industry saying you should reconsider:\n> You shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.\nâ€” Martin Fowler\nModular monoliths give you the logical architecture of Microservices without the operational complexity.

They can also be easily migrated into Microservices if you decide to do so.\nI've built and maintained several Modular monolith systems in the past years.\nIn this week's newsletter, I want to focus on the communication patterns in the Modular monolith architecture.\nBut first, let me explain what is a Modular monolith."
