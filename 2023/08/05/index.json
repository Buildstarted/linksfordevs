This is an odd behavior if you’re used to dense decoder-only models, where temp=0 should imply greedy sampling which should imply full determinism, because the logits for the next token should be a pure function of the input sequence & the model weights."

    "Description": " Modular monoliths are becoming more popular in the software engineering community.\nThe allure of Microservices is becoming less compelling. We also have seasoned veterans of our industry saying you should reconsider:\n> You shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.\n— Martin Fowler\nModular monoliths give you the logical architecture of Microservices without the operational complexity. You can safely determine the boundaries between modules. And refactoring is straightforward and less risky. They can also be easily migrated into Microservices if you decide to do so.\nI've built and maintained several Modular monolith systems in the past years.\nIn this week's newsletter, I want to focus on the communication patterns in the Modular monolith architecture.\nBut first, let me explain what is a Modular monolith."
