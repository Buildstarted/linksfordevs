    "Description": "So… I’ve had the most unreal week of coding. Zero exaggeration, I’ve halved the RAM requirements of the search engine, removed the need to take the system offline during an upgrade, removed hard limits on how many documents can be indexed, and quadrupled soft limits on how many keywords can be in the corpus.\nIt’s been a long term goal to keep it possible to run and operate the system on low-powered hardware, and so far improvements have been made, to the point where my 32 Gb RAM developer machine feels spacey rather than cramped, but this set of changes takes it several notches further."
