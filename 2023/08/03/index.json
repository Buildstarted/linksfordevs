Amber talks about the risks of creating products around LLMs while the technology is so young and constantly evolving, especially with how the general public reacts to conversational AI. Education is key, and constantly fact-checking - good advice for a lot of technology, but LLMs are making fact checking even more important!"

    "Description": "Room-temperature superconductivity has always been regarded as the ultimate\ngoal in the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, with its\nrealization holding revolutionary significance, capable of triggering\nsignificant changes in energy transmission and storage. However, achieving it\nposes various challenges. Recent research revealed that material\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O displays room-temperature superconductivity\nunder atmospheric pressure, sparking global interest in further exploration.\nHere, we utilized solid-phase synthesis to obtain a polycrystalline sample of\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O. X-ray diffraction confirmed its structural\nconsistency with referenced literature. Zero resistance, which is important\nevidence for superconductivity, was observed above 100$^\trc$ K under ambient\npressure in our experiment. Our finding indicates that\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a possible candidate for searching\nhigh-temperature superconductors."
