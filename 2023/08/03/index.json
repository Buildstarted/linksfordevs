However, achieving it\nposes various challenges. Recent research revealed that material\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O displays room-temperature superconductivity\nunder atmospheric pressure, sparking global interest in further exploration.\nHere, we utilized solid-phase synthesis to obtain a polycrystalline sample of\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O. X-ray diffraction confirmed its structural\nconsistency with referenced literature. Zero resistance, which is important\nevidence for superconductivity, was observed above 100$^\trc$ K under ambient\npressure in our experiment. Our finding indicates that\nPb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O is a possible candidate for searching\nhigh-temperature superconductors."
