    "Description": "We always thought of the Macintosh as a fast computer, since its 68000 microprocessor was effectively 10 times faster than an Apple II, but our Achilles heel was the floppy disk.  We had limited RAM, so it was often necessary to load data from the floppy, but there we were no faster than an Apple II.  Once we had real applications going, it was clear the floppy disk was going to be a significant bottleneck."
