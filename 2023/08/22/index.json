    "Description": "Has it really been that long? Apparently so. Valve originally announced their rebranding of Steam Play with Proton back on August 21st, 2018. Seems like a good time for a quick reflection being halfway to a decade old now with the tech that gave rise to the Steam Deck."

    "Description": "We always thought of the Macintosh as a fast computer, since its 68000 microprocessor was effectively 10 times faster than an Apple II, but our Achilles heel was the floppy disk.  We had limited RAM, so it was often necessary to load data from the floppy, but there we were no faster than an Apple II.  Once we had real applications going, it was clear the floppy disk was going to be a significant bottleneck."
