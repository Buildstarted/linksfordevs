    "Description": "Giorgi Dalakishvili is a software developer with more than a decade of experience. He works mainly with C#,  MVC/ Core, REST, WCF, Xamarin, Android, iOS, Entity Framework, Azure, SQL Server, and Oracle. &nbsp; Giorgi is an open-source author and contributor on GitHub and a member of the .NET Foundation and InfoQ Editor. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:33] Giorgi has worked with all the frameworks and libraries that Microsoft has come out with over the past 10â€’15 years. He discusses using Entity Framework and starting his small speaking engagements. [5:12]  is a website where you can put out some different topics that youâ€™d be willing to speak on, and just reach out to different user groups to take the plunge and do some public speaking for the first time. [6:03] Other types of data with Entity Framework beyond relational data, such as hierarchical data type from SQL Server. [8:49] How it simplifies your life. [9:28] What about JSON? Are there any limitations on the back-end database? [13:00] Is the support in EF Core 7.0 good enough to give a try if youâ€™re going against SQL Server? [14:09] What other types of data are interesting to work with with Entity Framework? [14:36] Using geospatial data. What does it even look like? [18:30] Full text search, and how itâ€™s different from a regular text search. [23:20] There are a lot of features to uncover in relational databases that we arenâ€™t even aware of yet. [26:22] There are some problems and some tasks that are better solved with non-relational databases, but the majority can overlap between the two systems. &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episodes:     â€” New Video Podcast!

    "Description": "A material called LK-99, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the\ncomposition Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_{6O}$ ($0.9<x<1.1$), has been\nsynthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal\ncharacteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature,\n$T_c$, and the levitation phenomenon as Meissner effect of a superconductor at\nroom temperature and atmospheric pressure below $T_c$. A LK-99 sample shows\n$T_c$ above 126.85$^\trc$C (400 K). We analyze that the possibility of\nroom-temperature superconductivity in this material is attributed to two\nfactors: the first being the volume contraction resulting from an\ninsulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second\nbeing on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural\ndeformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain (Pb2-O$_{1/2}$-Pb2 along the\nc-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at $T_c$. The mechanism\nof the room-temperature $T_c$ is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory."

    "Description": "A recent report of room temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure in\nCu-substituted apatite (`LK99') has invigorated interest in the understanding\nof what materials and mechanisms can allow for high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. Here I perform density functional theory calculations on\nCu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat\nbands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in\nalready established families of superconductors. I elucidate the origins of\nthese isolated bands as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu\nions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. These results\nsuggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy\nphysics in this system. Finally, I discuss the implications of my results on\npossible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite"

    "Timestamp": "2023-08-01T07:03:11",

    "Description": "The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature\nsuperconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational\nattention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite\n(Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have\nsuccessfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of\nthese compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a\nhighly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x10^9\nOhm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of\n~5.22x10^-4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting\nPb10-xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits\nsemiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity\nof ~1.94x10^4 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray\ndiffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition,\nwhen a pressed Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial\nNd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic\nlevitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a\nroom-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful\nre-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties."
