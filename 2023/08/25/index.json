    "Description": "While a system without disks or network could be useful for some purposes, before we can do very much with FreeBSD, we’re going to want those devices. Firecracker supports Virtio block and network devices and exposes them to virtual machines as mmio (memory-mapped I/O) devices. First step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Add device virtio_mmio to the Firecracker kernel configuration."

    "Description": "As part of taking over the editorial job of the WeAreDevelopers newsletter, I needed to get all the links from older editions and import them into a spreadsheet. Eventually I will write a scraping script, but there is a much simpler way to get all the links from a web site into a spreadsheet: browser developer tools. You can follow how that’s done in this video:"
