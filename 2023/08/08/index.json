    "Description": "We successfully synthesized polycrystalline LK-99-like ceramic samples with a\nsolid-state-sintering method. Powder X-ray diffraction shows that the main\ncontents are $\\mathrm{Pb_{10-x}Cu_x(PO_4)_6O}$ and $\\mathrm{Cu_2S}$, consistent\nwith recent reports [arXiv:2307.12037; arXiv:2308.01192]. In some small flaky\nfragments, we successfully observed ``half levitation'' atop a\n$\\mathrm{Nd_2Fe_{14}B}$ magnet. Using magnetization measurements on such small\npieces, as well as on a large piece which does not exhibit the half levitation,\nwe show that the samples ubiquitously contain weak yet definitive soft\nferromagnetic components. We argue that, together with the pronounced shape\nanisotropy of the small fragments, the soft ferromagnetism is sufficient to\nexplain the observed half levitation in strong vertical magnetic fields. Our\nmeasurements do not indicate the presence of the Meissner effect, nor zero\nresistance, in our samples, leading us to believe that our samples do not\nexhibit superconductivity."
