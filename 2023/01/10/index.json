Similar to Azure App Service, Azure Static Web App offers authentication out of the box. The service offers five authentication providers - Azure AD, Twitter, GitHub, Google, and Facebook, out of the five, two of them, Google and Facebook are in preview mode. In this post we will explore the Static web app running on Free Plan. For Standard plan we need to configure the social provider client Id, client secret and callback URIs.

Perhaps you want to check instantaneously that the value - a username maybe - \n\t\tdoesn't already exist in a database before you accept a new \n\t\tregistration. You cannot add an onchange event handler if \n\t\tyou already have a value bound to the element, so what can you do? In this \n\t\tarticle, I look at solutions for both HTML elements and EditForm input \n\t\tvalidation components up to an including .NET 7, and a new \n\t\tfeature released in .NET 7.0.1."
