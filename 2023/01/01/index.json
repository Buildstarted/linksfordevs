    "Description": "A teacher friend of mine told me that this year students were different. If she asked to see a hall pass from a freshman, they’d give her the finger. They swore at her and were generally rude. The behavior was so out of line that seniors would step in and tell them not to talk to her like that. I asked why she thought that was happening, and she said, “Covid”. The lack of socialization, especially at such a key time in life, had made this incoming class the first one that lacked basic manners and social skills."

    "Description": "As I look back to a turbulent year 2022, one of the things that sticks\nout scientifically for me is the advent of high-quality generative\nmodels. Whether it is DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, or many\nothers: I really felt like I was seeing a large leap forward in terms of\ncapabilities of machine learning systems! At the same time, the chasm\nbetween our understanding of these systems and our ability to use them\nseemed to widen even further. It turns out that even our most basic\nassumptions of how these systems can be trained are incomplete at best.\nFor instance, under the supervision of Tom\nGoldstein, researchers showed that novel\ndiffusion models are not—contrary to the previous consensus—overly\nreliant on Gaussian noise, and in fact, other sources of noise are\nequally valid.1"
