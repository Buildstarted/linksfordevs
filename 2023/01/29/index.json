Risk is, in-experienced developers (or sometimes experienced) might use them just cause they are 'best practice' and not think more about it. Even when it turns out they are not. Here is little example..."

    "Description": "Acting seems like the most inauthentic thing to do — like putting an external façade to manipulate the audience to get the desired effect. Most people learning to lead don’t associate acting with leadership. I balked when I opened the first chapter, “Presence: What Actors Have That Leaders Need,” of Belle Linda Halpern and Kathy Lubar’s Leadership Presence a few years ago. In that chapter, the authors described presence as “the ability to connect authentically with the thoughts and feelings of others."

    "Description": "There is a lot of idealistic rhetoric in the software industry. That’s not exactly new, and for the most part we’re able to look past the often quite absolute language (the “musts” and the “bests”), and remember the importance of context. But that statement generally only holds when we talk about software engineering principles (tools, technologies, and design patterns). I feel we have a way to go when we talk about software delivery principles (people and processes)."
