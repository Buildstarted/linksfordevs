    "Description": "Last year, we finished an early version of our Review Unit prototype, which showcased our displays, optics, and primary boards functioning together with our software. Our next major milestone is to deliver a more polished Review Unit (henceforth referred to as Simula's \"Polished Review Unit\") into the hands of YouTubers. After that, we will release a small early batch of Founders Edition units to our earliest preorderers. And after that, the remainder of our units will be distributed to the rest of our preorderers (in the order they were purchased, with preference for Founders Edition units first)."
