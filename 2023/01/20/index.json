Transitioning from a well-defined engineering individual contributor role to a nebulous startup leadership role meant a lot of falling on my face and a lot of lessons learned.\nHere are 3 tips to keep in mind if you’re starting on this journey and want to fail less than I did.\n1. Focus on What Matters by Zooming Out\nIn every context, it’s important to not get stuck on unimportant details.\nWhen building an early stage startup your time is one of the few resources you can spend, so you better be spending it wisely."

Rather than defining these manually, I wrote a Python script to generate the corresponding JSON programmatically. Fixing prefixing I’ve recently refound my love for tmux. Having multiple terminal panes, windows, and even sessions helps me keep my command-line shenanigans organized. By default, you interact with tmux by pressing a prefix key (Ctrl-B)..."

The article sparked a really nice discussion over at Hacker News, where a user had this to say:\nIdeas should be judged on their merits, but based on previous behavior I wouldn’t necessarily trust Johann Hari’s writing out of hand - ie other things in the book. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Hari\nIt’s a valid observation, and it got me thinking again about a concept I’ve been mulling over for a long time: Death of the Author."

    "Description": "Nearly all programs are written to access virtual memory addresses, which the CPU must translate to physical addresses. These translations are usually fast because the mappings are cached in the CPU's Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Unfortunately, virtual memory on x86 has used a 4 kiB page size since the 386 was released in 1985, when computers had a bit less memory than they do today. Also unfortunately, TLBs are pretty small because they need to be fast. For example, AMD's Zen 4 Microarchitecture, which first shipped in September 2022, has a first level data TLB with 72 entries, and a second level TLB with 3072 entries. This means when an application's working set is larger than approximately 4 kiB × 3072 = 12 MiB, some memory accesses will require page table lookups, multiplying the number of memory accesses required. This is a brand-new CPU, with one of the biggest TLBs on the market, so most systems will be worse. Using larger virtual memory page sizes (aka huge pages) can reduce page mapping overhead substantially. Since RAM is so much larger than it was in 1985, a larger page size seems like obviously a good idea to me."
