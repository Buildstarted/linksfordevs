It’s a computer keyboard without a screen that I type on to capture my thoughts everywhere, even as I drift off to sleep. I have one in my bed, and I also keep them on my desk at work and in various spots around my apartment; anywhere an idea strikes, I have a Go Note Go keyboard ready to capture that idea."
