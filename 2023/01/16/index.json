I know enough\n    about the languages I use and the problems I’m tasked with that it feels like 95% of my time\n    coding has become mundane. This might sound benign and probably a little egotistical but it's\n    had a effect on my motivation. I've also noticed others in the same conundrum time and time\n    again in our communities: solicitation for advice about getting out of a funk at work, or a\n    senior dev's worriment about having to eventually manage people. Work is at its worst when it’s\n    boring and when there’s no foreseeable path forward it feels like a drag. And so, I finally had\n    time to think about why I’ve been so burned out the last few years over the span of two jobs —\n    I had no idea what paths were available."
