So when it comes to building our software, why do we treat the CI pipeline without the same level of engineering as the production code?\nSo, why not use feature flags in your CI pipeline?\nTLDR Reduce the risk of breaking a CI pipeline for all of a project’s developers by using the flagon CLI to query Feature Flags, opting developers into and out of new CI features and processes by targeting groups of developers or branch naming patterns."

I read Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus recently (you should read it, it’s great), and I learned that someone1 has come up with a name for this sort of modern reinterpretation of “let them eat cake”: cruel optimism.\nCruel optimism, the way Hari interprets it2, boils down to the folly of suggesting personal solutions to systemic problems. It’s about advice given from a position of privilege to people who will never be able to apply it to their own lives–because the cards are stacked so unfairly against them–but who will nonetheless interpret their failure as a personal one."
