A feature platform handles feature engineering, feature computation, and serving computed features for models to use to generate predictions. Many companies -- Airbnb, LinkedIn, Snap, Meta, etc. -- have publicly discussed the architecture and use cases of their feature platforms. The first part discusses the evolution of feature platforms, how they differ from model platforms and feature stores. The second part discusses the core challenges of making feature platforms self-serve for data scientists and increase the iteration speed for feature engineering."
