    "Description": "In this post I’ll attempt the fun stunt of designing a system that could serve the full production load of Twitter with most of the features intact on a single (very powerful) machine. I’ll start by showing off a Rust prototype of the core tweet distribution data structure handling 35x full load by fitting the hot set in RAM and parallelizing with atomics, and then do math around how modern high-performance storage and networking might let you serve a close-to-fully-featured Twitter on one machine."
