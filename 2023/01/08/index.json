I hope they will be safe and that their wishes will come true in 2023. On the personal and technical side, here’s a summary of the past year from my perspective. Job change First and foremost, I changed jobs. I worked for Hazelcast for 3½ years. However, I started to become dissatisfied with the company\b"

For the majority of this timespan, these records are disparate and sparse: diaries, business records, funeral rites, censuses. Historians curate these snippets of evidence to create a picture of life in our past.\nHowever, the last few decades have ushered in the information age. The amount of data about our lives that is now recorded is staggering. It’s estimated we collectively produce trillions of megabytes of data every day."

I’ll start by showing off a Rust prototype of the core tweet distribution data structure handling 35x full load by fitting the hot set in RAM and parallelizing with atomics, and then do math around how modern high-performance storage and networking might let you serve a close-to-fully-featured Twitter on one machine."
