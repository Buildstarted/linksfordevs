These models hallucinate a lot, lack the knowledge of their more parameter-heavy counterparts, and are not nearly as reliable. However, with the right prompt, they are just effective enough at generating marketing copies, manipulating societal opinions, and making convincing arguments on either side as we are prompting."

However, one should always maintain an impartial critical vision of the tools, no matter how useful they can be. For this reason, I decided to share my thoughts about some features that are currently lacking or require over-complicated solutions (often from third-party tools), in the hope that Microsoft will find them useful when working on Power BI’s development roadmap."
