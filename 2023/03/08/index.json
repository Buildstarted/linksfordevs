Then later that year, I attended Lambda Retreat, conducted by Anand, who is my colleague and has found SICP to be quite profound himself.\nIt changed the way I think about programs, added new perspective, and got me interested in the design and implementation of programming languages."

A made up term I use to denote a thin waist the editor is build upon, the set of core concepts, entities and APIs which power the variety of editor's components.\nIn this post, I will highlight Emacs' thin waist, which I think is worthy of imitation!"
