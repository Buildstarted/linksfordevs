Implementing and Exploiting Cryptography</i> details dozens of practical cryptographic implementations and then breaks down the flaws that adversaries use to exploit them. You’ll learn just what it takes to write cryptographically secure code, build an intuition for spotting potential vulnerabilities, and master techniques to avoid the pitfalls that leave your systems at risk."
