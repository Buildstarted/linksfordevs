    "Description": "This December I once again did the Advent of Code,\nin Rust. If you are interested, my solutions\nare on Github. I wanted to highlight one particular solution to the day 2\nproblem as it is both optimized completely\nbeyond the point of reason yet contains a useful technique. For simplicity weâ€™re\nonly going to do part 1 of the day 2 problem here, but the exact same techniques\napply to part 2."
