We all have examples of domain knowledge we learned somewhere along the way and stashed in our toolbox. Whenever I encounter these situations I try to remember to post about them so that the next person can find the information at least a little bit faster than I did."

    "Description": "The killer use case for large language models (LLMs) is clearly summarization. At least today, in my limited experience, LLMs are incapable of generating unique insights. While LLMs are good at writing creatively regurgitated text based on certain inputs or writing generally about a topic, they’re unlikely to “think” something unique. However, LLMs appear to be quite good at knowing what they do and don’t know, and this is especially true when they are provided with a clear chunk of information or text to summarize."
