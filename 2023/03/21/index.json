And I’m not alone - NLP students lost their field of research overnight, meanwhile some orgs at FAANG became obsolete. It is an old news that chatGPT can pass a software developer tests at FAANG, an exam to become a lawyer or generate inspirational phrases for your YouTube shorts. But I’m sceptical that we will experience a radical transformation in a short time of a few years, but rather, it will be an iterative change which can take a decade or more. But as a story goes, a slowly boiled frog was too comfortable to jump out of a pot, the fate we shall avoid."

Within a couple of years, we won't need developers any more! …Or at least, that's the narrative going viral on Twitter. I'm much more optimistic about what these AI advancements mean for the future of software development."

It has inspired imitators such as Spack & Guix. Given the concepts introduced by Nix and it’s willingnes to eschew some fundamental Linux concepts such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. I can’t help but think has Nix gone far enough within the 20 years?"

    "Description": "A common question in the chess community is whether to play e4 or d4 as a beginner. Opinions are generally split between e4 being better for learning, no difference, and rarely that d4 is better. Typical reasoning being that e4 leads to sharper games and gives you more opportunities to learn. The other starting moves as white are rarely recommended for beginners altogether and rarely played at all levels. Another common question is whether playing shorter or longer games helps you improve faster, with the orthodoxy being that longer games help you learn more overall. The standard argument I’ve seen is that you have more time to analyze things in longer games which helps in all modes while the skills you improve in quicker games are less applicable in the longer time controls. I’ve downloaded games from Lichess’ database to explore those questions."
