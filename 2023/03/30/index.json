I believe this sort of practice is guided by a misconstrued perception of what the relationship is between people and their ability to develop software. There should be no “Java Developer” or “React Developer;” there should be only “Software Developer,” regardless of the languages a person will be interacting with in a job. People don’t know programming languages to the extent they should be labeled with them. It may even make more sense to say that people can’t “know” programming languages to begin with."
