    "Description": "For more than a year, Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez has clung to the Bill C-11 mantra of ‚Äúplatforms in, users out‚Äù. When presented with clear evidence from thousands of digital creators, the former chair of the CRTC, and numerous experts that that wasn't true, the Senate passed compromise language to ensure that platforms such as Youtube would be caught by the legislation consistent with the government's stated objective, but that user content would not. Last night, Rodriguez rejected the compromise amendment, turning his back on digital creators and a Senate process lauded as one of the most comprehensive ever. In doing so, he has left no doubt about the government‚Äôs true intent with Bill C-11: retain power and flexibility to regulate user content."
