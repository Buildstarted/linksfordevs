    "Description": "I got annoyed with my personal laptop always being out of battery when I wanted to work on my small programming projects, so I am building myself a laptop form factor device. It currently has an estimated battery life of up to 2 years depending on ambient light (with a 12000 mAh li-po battery), but I am hoping to eventually make it powered by ambient light alone. It needs to have a good keyboard and a decent programming environment - compatability with existing software is not a priority, nor is powerful hardware - just the minimum required for a LISP environment. Writing a minimal editor, word processor, spreadsheet app or whatever else I want will be part of the fun! My current working prototype is based on the Sparkfun Artemis module, running uLisp; and using a monochrome 4.4\" Sharp Memory Display. I'm happy to talk about my project. Ask me anything!"
