They are interchangeably the same concept but the distinction between AI and ML can be a litmus test for expertise: those who use ‘AI’ may have a broader, less technical perspective, while ‘ML’ indicates a deeper, more technical knowhow. This distinction is essential when discussing the recent Executive Order (EO) 14110 on AI Safety by the White House, which has stirred debates about technological control and ideological capture.\n"

A big obstacle is that they often listen to native speakers’ speech, but they have never heard their own voice with a native accent. If learners could listen to their own voice speaking with a native accent, they can notice the differences and improve how they sound. Think of it like a personal AI accent coach but with your own voice."
