Now, you suddenly sense that your hard-earned acumen in that initial stack has not only atrophied over the years but also a portion, or all of it, has become irrelevant, making it a bit of a struggle to catch up with the latest changes."

    "Description": "When we buy something, we pay only a small fraction of its cost.\nI reflected on this while also realizing how many good things capitalism does for us (others not so good, but that’s for another day). Given enough demand, more companies compete to offer you a better product, usually at a lower price. Products get better and cheaper over time.\nTake ‘Elden Ring’ as an example. This video game, five years in the making, can be purchased for 60 USD and is yours forever."
