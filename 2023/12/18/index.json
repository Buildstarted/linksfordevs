You might be thinking: What makes event handler leaks so important? Event handler leaks are easy to cause, all it takes is to forget to unsubscribe to an event. Additionally, they are quite difficult to spot and even trickier to fix.The new insight added to the Visual Studio Managed Memory Usage Tool introduced in update 17.8 Preview 2 significantly trivializes the process of spotting/fixing these leaks. It provides information on which objects are leaking and the event it subscribed to."

Big companies that develop large applications move much more slowly. Those might be systems developed for many years or decades by hundreds of developers. I’m talking about products like the Amazon marketplace, AutoCAD, or any operating system. These products take a very long time to release new features or fix bugs, considering the amount of engineers they employ."
