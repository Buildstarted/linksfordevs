The first movies in which the iconic mouse appeared – most famously, Steamboat Willie­[1] – were made in 1928 and works from that year go into the public domain in the United States on New Year’s Day 2024.[2] The public domain has had some famous recent arrivals, but this is the most anticipated entry yet.

Additionally, they are quite difficult to spot and even trickier to fix.The new insight added to the Visual Studio Managed Memory Usage Tool introduced in update 17.8 Preview 2 significantly trivializes the process of spotting/fixing these leaks. It provides information on which objects are leaking and the event it subscribed to."

These products take a very long time to release new features or fix bugs, considering the amount of engineers they employ."
