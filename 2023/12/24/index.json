In the past, I might have thought, \"Playing games like this would be ruinous, leading to personal downfall.\" But now, as I've grown older, I've stopped worrying about these concerns and am thoroughly enjoying this obsession.

Later, I enjoyed reading comics and books at a leisurely pace; it was more of a gradual enjoyment rather than an obsession that would cost me sleep.
