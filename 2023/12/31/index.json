    "Description": "SteamOS 3 (‚ÄúHolo‚Äù) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the Steam Deck, Valve Software‚Äôs portable PC gaming device. It‚Äôs a very interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into that partition. But consumers can also run steamos-devmode to unlock the root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them a working Linux distro with a normal package manager."
