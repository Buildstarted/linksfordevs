Check back as I add to this series.\nI was reminded of how much the Actor Model influenced me as a developer when I recently read Petabridge’s post about reflecting on 10 years of building Akka.NET. At first I thought, “oh my goodness - it’s been 10 years!!” and reflected on how much my life has changed over those 10 years."
