If the character stored\nin the variable _ does not match the first character of the\nstring a, the code recurses in such a way that this same block\nof code will again be entered.  That is, t=-65 forces a return\nto the if (t < -50) block.  The recursion steps through string\na, character by character.  When finally _ == a, the\ncharacter at a+31 is printed and returned."

In a few days it's 2024 and we can celebrate that it's been a concept for 10 years. Strangely, I still encounter new implementations that want to go 'headless' based on an almost religious belief that it's the new cool thing."
