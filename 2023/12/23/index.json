    "Description": "In 2014 the term 'headless cms' was coined - and presented as a cool new 'feature' in the Web CMS industry. And it quickly became a hot buzzword for a few years later. In a few days it's 2024 and we can celebrate that it's been a concept for 10 years. Strangely, I still encounter new implementations that want to go 'headless' based on an almost religious belief that it's the new cool thing."

Where I live there are still machines from the 1600â€™s that are just as magnificent today as when they were first built. When you see one standing in a field rotating and converting passing air into usable energy they look like simplicity incarnate, but nothing could be further from the truth."

Not enough on when it is appropriate to have SREs. This post is a take on that angle.\nDisclaimer: I was an SRE at Google and this piece represents only my own views."
