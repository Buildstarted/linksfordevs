    "Description": "Windmills have always fascinated me and for a long time I was dreaming of one day building my own. Where I live there are still machines from the 1600’s that are just as magnificent today as when they were first built. When you see one standing in a field rotating and converting passing air into usable energy they look like simplicity incarnate, but nothing could be further from the truth."

Spare the frustration, perhaps what you need is Sysadmins.\nSince the term was coined by Ben Treynor in 2003 at Google, lots of ink was spent on praising SRE practices. Not enough on when it is appropriate to have SREs. This post is a take on that angle.\nDisclaimer: I was an SRE at Google and this piece represents only my own views."
