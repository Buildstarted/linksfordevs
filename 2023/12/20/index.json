Unlike ASP.NET Core MVC, Web API projects doesn‚Äôt support the --auth Individual option while creating the Web API project from dotnet SDK. We have to manually add the nuget package references. So first we need to create a web api project, we can do that using the following command - ` dotnet new webapi ‚Äìname Weatherforecast.Api ‚Äìoutput Weatherforecast`. Next we need to add reference of different NuGet packages. I am using Sql Server as the backend."

    "Description": "MySQL is a popular relational database. We revisit Kleppmann‚Äôs 2014 Hermitage and confirm that MySQL‚Äôs Repeatable Read still allows G2-item, G-single, and lost update. Using our transaction consistency checker Elle, we show that MySQL Repeatable Read also violates internal consistency. Furthermore, it violates Monotonic Atomic View: transactions can observe some of another transaction‚Äôs effects, then later fail to observe other effects of that same transaction. We demonstrate violations of ANSI SQL‚Äôs requirements for Repeatable Read. We believe MySQL Repeatable Read is somewhat stronger than Read Committed. As a lagniappe, we show that AWS RDS MySQL clusters routinely violate Serializability. This work was performed independently without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy."
