Why do we think that? The approximate answer is because of scaling laws which suggest indefinite improvement for the current style of transformers with additional pre-training data and parameters. This blog post delves into the intricacies of these scaling laws and examines how they guide the development of more powerful and efficient LLMs. I will be as comprehensive as I can (with the math knowledge I have) including parts about the scaling law origins, recent finding and their implications."

Using our transaction consistency checker Elle, we show that MySQL Repeatable Read also violates internal consistency. Furthermore, it violates Monotonic Atomic View: transactions can observe some of another transaction’s effects, then later fail to observe other effects of that same transaction. We demonstrate violations of ANSI SQL’s requirements for Repeatable Read. We believe MySQL Repeatable Read is somewhat stronger than Read Committed. As a lagniappe, we show that AWS RDS MySQL clusters routinely violate Serializability.
