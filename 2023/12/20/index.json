So first we need to create a web api project, we can do that using the following command - ` dotnet new webapi –name Weatherforecast.Api –output Weatherforecast`. Next we need to add reference of different NuGet packages. I am using Sql Server as the backend."

    "Description": "MySQL is a popular relational database. We revisit Kleppmann’s 2014 Hermitage and confirm that MySQL’s Repeatable Read still allows G2-item, G-single, and lost update. Using our transaction consistency checker Elle, we show that MySQL Repeatable Read also violates internal consistency. Furthermore, it violates Monotonic Atomic View: transactions can observe some of another transaction’s effects, then later fail to observe other effects of that same transaction. We demonstrate violations of ANSI SQL’s requirements for Repeatable Read. We believe MySQL Repeatable Read is somewhat stronger than Read Committed. As a lagniappe, we show that AWS RDS MySQL clusters routinely violate Serializability. This work was performed independently without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy."
