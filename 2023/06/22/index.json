    "Description": "When working on a project, you typically focus on a specific feature at a time, making changes on a dedicated branch for that feature. When it's time for you to integrate these modifications into the project's code base, the code base has likely evolved since you began working on your feature, as other team members have also pushed their work. That's why your code changes may introduce errors in the application you are developing."

Savannah talks about staying high-level with azd commands, keeping the complexity of deployment pipelines in tools you already know how to use, like Bicep and Terraform. The conversation digs into the templating system to help assemble all the platforms and elements of an Azure deployment, depending on your application. There are a ton of options - check it out!"
