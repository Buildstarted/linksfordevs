    "Description": "Software and Hardware have pretty clear definitions, but when it comes to firmware… I ended up with the horribly vague definition that it's about software that's usually hard to modify or just external to the OS or just scary to update in case of failure. And I wouldn't be surprised to discover yet another common usage that would require to update this definition as it's pretty much a kitchen-sink. And I could bet that no one could say that some software definitely isn't firmware.\n\tThe annoying part is seems to serve as a way of hiding that it is in fact just plain software, meaning something you can modify, rewrite, audit, … albeit sometimes with the hardware putting some limits but that says more about the hardware than the software.\n\tIn fact you can sometimes avoid such hardware limitations with some flash storage instead, see Flash Cartridges for example, where you can even use data that used to be on a ROM on those, with no modifications to be done but then made easy."
