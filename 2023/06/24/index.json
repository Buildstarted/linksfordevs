    "Description": "In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by Matt Hunt to chat about using the CQS pattern to improve your codebase quality and help avoid writing those â€˜Big Ball of Mudâ€™ code-bases that sadly we see way too often in our industry!\nCQS (Command Query Separation) is a pattern that states that a method should either be a command that performs an action or a query that returns data, but not both."
