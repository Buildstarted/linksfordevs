    "Description": " Today's modern applications must deliver the latest information without refreshing the user interface.\nIf you need to introduce real-time functionality to your application in .NET, there's one library you will most likely reach for - SignalR.\nSignalR allows you to push content from your server-side code to any connected clients as changes happen in real-time.\nHere's what I'll teach you in this week's newsletter: - Creating your first SignalR Hub - Testing SignalR from Postman - Creating strongly typed hubs - Sending messages to a specific user\nLet's see why SignalR is so powerful and how easy it is to build real-time applications."
