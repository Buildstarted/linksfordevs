    "Description": "As we’ve explained before, zero-knowledge apps (or ZK apps) will come in two different shapes: VM instructions and arithmetic circuits.\nVM instructions should sound familiar. Reading them is like reading assembly, and they’re a level of abstraction higher than arithmetic circuits (as pointed out by this post).\nWhatever they’re writing, real programmers need to see what their programs compile down to (according to John Carmack). That’s how you find unoptimized bits as a low-level code monkey, but it’s also how you find some security issues and bugs."
