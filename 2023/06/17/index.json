One of my other favorite retro devices is the HP Jornada 720. A small handheld PC (smaller than a netbook) running Windows CE or in my case, Linux. It has a decent keyboard, CFL backlit screen, 32 MB of RAM(!), a compact Flash card for storage and a stylus for the resistive touchscreen. Oh and I got a 10Mbit PCMCIA network card, but wireless cards are also still available. It might be old, released in 1999, but can do one thing your modern iPhone can't."

    "Description": " Is the Anemic domain model an antipattern? It's a domain model without any behavior and only data properties.\nAnemic domain models work great in simple applications, but they are difficult to maintain and evolve if you have rich business logic.\nThe important parts of your business logic and rules end up being scattered all over the application. It reduces cohesiveness and reusability, and makes adding new features more difficult.\nRich domain model attempts to solve this by encapsulating as much of the business logic as possible.\nBut how can you design a Rich domain model?\nThis is a never-ending process of moving business logic into the domain and refining your domain model.\nLet's see how to refactor from an Anemic domain model to a Rich domain model."
