Recent advances have begun to explore the impact of much slower endurance-based training on metabolic health and potentially longevity. We will deep dive into this training practice to discuss how to incorporate this into your daily life and what's going on at the cellular, molecular & whole-body level when you train in zone 2 & 5. Lastly, we'll look at how these training modalities impact longevity, reduced risk of all-cause mortality, and the benefits of maintaining endurance exercise your entire life.  "

An astonishing and unbelievable 39 years later, the looming question is approaching reality. Companies, organizations, and individuals now have the power to interact, create, and integrate these models into their daily lives. With every conversation with the models, the notions generated and the flow of words make it increasingly apparent – the models we considered toys with the release of the Transformer architecture have surpassed the earlier realization. They exhibit a remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, a trait that used to be the standard of what it meant to be human. Simply put, the argument that only humans can comprehend and respond against the notion of a robot uprising has been rendered null."
