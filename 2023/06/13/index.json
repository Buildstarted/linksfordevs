There are zero UK-operated websites found in the US’s top 50. Our accents are being adopted, but our websites are certainly not. They are as spiceless as our beige cuisine (But god I do love fish and chips).\nThis isn’t a gripe about where the UK sources its web from."

    "Description": "I don’t know about you, but I hate using the mouse. The entire concept of a mouse is not productive. I’m supposed to move my hand to a different place, nudge something with accuracy, and click a button. I’m getting tired just thinking about it. I’d argue that unless you’re doing design or graphics, you can get by with just a keyboard. Most certainly as a software developer. Well, an occasional mouse contact might be required to browse a website and whatnot, but you’ll be better off without it for most things."
