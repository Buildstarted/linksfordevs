They are as spiceless as our beige cuisine (But god I do love fish and chips).\nThis isnâ€™t a gripe about where the UK sources its web from."

Iâ€™m supposed to move my hand to a different place, nudge something with accuracy, and click a button. Iâ€™m getting tired just thinking about it. Iâ€™d argue that unless youâ€™re doing design or graphics, you can get by with just a keyboard. Most certainly as a software developer. Well, an occasional mouse contact might be required to browse a website and whatnot, but youâ€™ll be better off without it for most things."
