I’m not sure what exactly it is I want – I say I should feel like my life is meaningful, but what exactly does that mean? While “meaningfulness” sounds like a noble goal, it could consist of less noble goals like winning the esteem of others, or being recognized as one of the “best” at something. Would I be ok if I was the best at something that everyone else thought was trivial? I want to do good in the world as well as do something meaningful, and I think those go hand in hand. But one thing is certain - there does feel like there’s a void in my life."

When it’s a failure, they always come out of the woodwork to let you know you weren’t doing it according to the orthodoxy. When you point out that it isn’t faster in practice, they gaslight you and claim that was never the point in the first place. In a way it reminds me of a cult. You do a series arcane rituals that have no scientific evidence behind them, none of the process is data-driven or statistically proven. Frankly, it can’t die soon enough but as we all know some new hype will simply take its place to give busybody managers a reason to exist."
