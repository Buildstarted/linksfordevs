    "Description": "Sonica is a VSCode extension that provides audio cues for rulers, principally aimed at visually impaired developers. The primary use case is to be able to easily respect line limits, by having cues when specific positional boundaries get crossed. The code is available on github, and the extension is available via the VSCode extensions interface, as well as in the marketplace. Below, I describe its usage, the developmental background, and potential future development directions."
