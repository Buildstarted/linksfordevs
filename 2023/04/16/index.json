Github is further extending this idea with Copilot for CLI, which looks promising but isn’t generally available yet.\nI’ll describe a tool I’ve created, called “Shell AI” (sai) that integrates a language model directly into the command line interface to generate and run shell commands on the fly."

Transporter technology allows for instantaneous and cheap movement of humans and objects anywhere on a planet, and into or out of orbit. The same devices that allow for transportation can also re-organize matter into arbitrary configurations. This means that anything that can be designed can be owned for essentially no cost. What do people do in such a world? As Gene Roddenberry imagined, they explore."
