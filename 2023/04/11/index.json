Not only are software engineers costly, but code itself carries a certain weight. Once code is written, it must be maintained and extended. Bugs and migrations are costly mistakes, prompting us to adopt practices such as continuous integration (CI), test-driven development (TDD), and code reviews. These practices aim to identify issues as early as possible and shift development leftward."
