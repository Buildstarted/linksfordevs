    "Description": "How do you know the code you write is being used in production? Carl and Richard talk to Roni Dover about his work with Digma to help bring code utilization into your development tooling. Roni talks about the challenges of getting and using production telemetry - often, it never reaches developers. But with OpenTelemetry, there's a lot of data out there; the challenge is to present it helpfully - and that's what Digma is all about. It's still in beta, but sign up if you want to get involved!"

    "Description": "An article making the rounds, \"Who Killed\nProlog?\", asks: of the major programming traditions—imperative,\nfunctional, object-oriented, and logic—why did the logic-programming one,\nexemplified by Prolog, more or less die (to overstate its death a little)? The\nauthor, prominent Prolog veteran Maarten van Emden, traces it back to a large\nJapanese-government project, \"Fifth-Generation Computer System\", active from\n1982 to 1992, which could've been Prolog's killer app, but instead failed and\ntook Prolog down with it.  I don't doubt that history might have been different\nif a few large Prolog projects in the 1980s turned out differently, and this\none in particular might be key. But with all due respect, I think a larger\nreason for Prolog gradually losing steam is that its uniqueness as a\ndeclarative language has been chipped away."
