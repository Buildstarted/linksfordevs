Roni talks about the challenges of getting and using production telemetry - often, it never reaches developers. But with OpenTelemetry, there's a lot of data out there; the challenge is to present it helpfully - and that's what Digma is all about. It's still in beta, but sign up if you want to get involved!"

The\nauthor, prominent Prolog veteran Maarten van Emden, traces it back to a large\nJapanese-government project, \"Fifth-Generation Computer System\", active from\n1982 to 1992, which could've been Prolog's killer app, but instead failed and\ntook Prolog down with it.  I don't doubt that history might have been different\nif a few large Prolog projects in the 1980s turned out differently, and this\none in particular might be key. But with all due respect, I think a larger\nreason for Prolog gradually losing steam is that its uniqueness as a\ndeclarative language has been chipped away."
