Previous posts have given good solutions for specific instances: Fitting cubic Bézier curves primarily addressed Euler spirals (which are very smooth), while Parallel curves of cubic Béziers rendered parallel curves. In this post, I describe refinements of the ideas to solve the much more general problem of simplifying arbitrary paths. Along with the theoretical ideas, a reasonably solid implementation is landing in kurbo, a Rust library for 2D shapes."
