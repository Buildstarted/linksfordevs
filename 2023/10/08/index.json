While there’s a large overlap between a Virtualization stack for Servers and the one for Automotive platforms, the latter is much more demanding on one particular aspect: GPU acceleration.\nFor me, personally, that meant having to delve into the Linux graphics stack, both kernel (DRM, GEM, KMS…) and userspace (Mesa, virglrenderer…), something in which, so far, I only had a superficial knowledge."

Many people seemed to think that this notice was appreciated and gave people enough time to learn about the issue and know they would have to update in the future. But I’d argue the whole approach curl has taken is ultimately undesirable and put users at risk for no reason."
