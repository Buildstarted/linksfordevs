This has been a topic of many discussions, and I want to share my opinion.\nOne school of thought suggests using exceptions for flow control. This is not a good approach because it makes the code harder to reason about. The caller must know the implementation details and which exceptions to handle.\nExceptions are for exceptional situations.\nToday, I want to show you how to implement error handling using the Result pattern.\nIt's a functional approach to error handling, making your code more expressive."
