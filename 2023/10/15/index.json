Live Tech Games also runs games that are televised live in event halls and pubs after live shows and sporting events to help draw in large audiences from across the United Kingdom. In September 2022, Live Tech Games began working on Knockout, a new football trivia game in which players go head-to-head in three rounds televised at the end of each match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar."
