You can reach him at his blog at  and he makes films at . &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [5:34] What got Shawn excited about coding? [9:26] How should developers be thinking about just the concept of an API? What are the categories that they should be aware of? [16:04] Shawn’s first steps in designing an API. [18:37] What are the newer concepts and newer advances that are worth taking a look at? [19:10] Maturing minimal APIs. [24:53] Endpoint filtering. [27:01] Does the core logic need to be aware that it might be in a caching workflow, or does caching as a concept belong to the interface for the application programming? [31:45] Shawn’s favorite method for testing the complete set of web service APIs. [34:59] Helping young developers not get lost along the way of feeling the need to be perfect. [39:25] How developers make the decision of where and how to run the applications they built. &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode: YARP     — New Video Podcast! Email us at .
