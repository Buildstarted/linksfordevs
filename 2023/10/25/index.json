    "Description": "Yesterday I read a great article from Sentry entitled\n\"We\nJust Gave $500,000 to Open Source Maintainers\", and it made me wonder\njust how much Tarsnap had spent\non supporting open source software over the years.  Ever since\nDecember 2009\nTarsnap has spent 100% of its December operating profits on supporting\nopen source software — which, since needs for support aren't limited\nto December, means that Tarsnap hands out money throughout the year, and\nat the end of the year (when I know how much profit Tarsnap made in\nDecember) I send whatever is left in the \"budget\" to the\nFreeBSD Foundation.\nGoing through 14 years of accounting spreadsheets brought me to a total\nof $274,482 — or in binary terms, slightly over 2^18 USD."
