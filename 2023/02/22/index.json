    "Description": "I have always been fascinated by .NET’s\nStackOverflowException.\nIt’s interesting because it’s fundamentally different from most other exceptions—you can’t catch it with\na try/catch block. When you overflow the stack, it’s game over—the runtime will terminate your process.\nThis behavior is especially devastating for web services that are deserializing user-controlled data. If\nyour data structure allows recursion, malicious users can easily craft a highly nested payload and use it\nto DDoS your website."
