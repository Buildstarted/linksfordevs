When you overflow the stack, itâ€™s game overâ€”the runtime will terminate your process.\nThis behavior is especially devastating for web services that are deserializing user-controlled data. If\nyour data structure allows recursion, malicious users can easily craft a highly nested payload and use it\nto DDoS your website."
