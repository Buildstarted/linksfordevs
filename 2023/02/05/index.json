    "Description": "I introduced kimchi in this blogpost last year. It's the general-purpose zero-knowledge proof system that we will use in the next hardfork of Mina. We've been working on it continuously over the last two years to improve its features, performance, and usability.\n\nKimchi by itself is only a backend to create proofs. The whole picture includes:\n\nPickles, the recursion layer, for verifying proofs wit ..."
