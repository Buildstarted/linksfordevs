Specially Pharo at Inria, France's National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology.  However, the lack of a native plugin for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, has been a major limitation for high efficiency AI development with Pharo. I've wrote this post to let you know that, I've proposed a Google Summer of Code 2023 project to create a TensorFlow plugin for Pharo, which will unlock the full potential of Pharo for production grade AI development."
