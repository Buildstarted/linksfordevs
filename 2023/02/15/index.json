    "Description": "Universally composable (UC) security is the most widely used framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. Many variants and simplifications of the framework have been proposed and developed, nonetheless, many practitioners find UC proofs to be both difficult to construct and understand.\n\nWe remedy this situation by proposing a new framework for protocol security. We believe that our framework provides proofs that are both easier to write, but also more rigorous, and easier to understand. Our work is based on state-separable proofs allowing for modular proofs, by decomposing complicated protocols into simple components."

From EF Core 2.0 onwards, EF Core supports compiled queries, which helps developers to compile the queries in advance and executed when application executes the query. By default EF Core automatically compiles and caches your queries using a hashed representation of the query expression - when the code runs the previously executed query, EF Core lookup the cache with the hash value and returns the compiled query from the cache. We can explicitly compile the query upfront and invoke the compiled query. To compile the query, EF Core exposes two extension methods in EF class - EF.CompileQuery() and EF.CompileAsyncQuery(). These methods helps us to create compiled queries and call them using a delegate."

    "Description": "It’s a well-known fact that our mobile devices come equipped with all kinds of sensors used for various features that we tend to take for granted. For example, a phone knows if it’s held in portrait or landscape orientation, it knows if you’re walking in a certain direction, and it can even detect if you’ve left it on a table screen-up or screen-down. All of this information is calculated internally using various electronic sensors. But, as game devs can we make use of these sensors for our video games? The answer is yes, and it’s relatively straightforward."

Of course, he didn't actually say that we're fucked, because he's much nicer than I am. He uses soft and gentle words that disguise the raging maelstrom beneath us. His video talks about how “everything is about to change”, and he's right. I think he's more right than he wants to be, he knows it, and he's terrified."
