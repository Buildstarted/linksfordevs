C# relies on object-oriented, imperative principles, and F# relies on functional principles.  Some developers are using F# as a complement to C#, rather than relying on the functional capabilities that exist natively in C#."

For example, a phone knows if it’s held in portrait or landscape orientation, it knows if you’re walking in a certain direction, and it can even detect if you’ve left it on a table screen-up or screen-down. All of this information is calculated internally using various electronic sensors. But, as game devs can we make use of these sensors for our video games? The answer is yes, and it’s relatively straightforward."
