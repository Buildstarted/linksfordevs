    "Domain": "peterme.net",
    "Description": "This is a question which has been asked in various places over the years, and recently on the forum in multiple separate threads. Seeing how I’ve built commercial software with Nim dynamic libraries, I thought I’d chime in with my knowledge. But since there are multiple threads out there and this is a large-ish topic I figured it would be better to do it as a post on here."

    "Description": "Overview: A few months ago, I was cleaning off my hardware workbench when I came across my FiiO M6, an Android-based “portable high-resolution lossless music player”. I originally purchased the device to aid in my language learning studies and dabble in the world of “hi-fi” audio. With both those phases of my life well in the past, the device seemed to make a perfect vulnerability research target. Coincidentally, I had also just watched through all of gamozolabs’s Android exploitation livestream, so I was feeling even more inspired to target an Android-based device."
