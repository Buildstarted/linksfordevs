    "Description": "A communication heuristic, optimized for asynchronous communication of detailed concepts between human beings.\nRationale Existence “proof”  Our short term memory can hold at best about 7 +/- 2 chunks of information at a time. Start with the lower end of that: 5 chunks. Assume that whatever someone is “really” trying to do takes up 1 of those 5. We’re left with 4 chunks.  Conclusion Organize your work processes as much as possible so that they can be effectively understood using at most 4 chunks of short-term memory."
