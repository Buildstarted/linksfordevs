Its accomplishments include being the most popular DB [among professional developers] according to Stack Overflow survey of 2022, the database in all of the fastest TechEmpower benchmarks, and being the most advanced open source database (self-proclaimed).\nWe’ll talk today about combining Postgres with my favorite language and runtime: C# and .NET. Just because Postgres isn’t a first-party Microsoft database, like SQL Server, doesn’t mean you don’t have full support for it in C#."

    "Description": "The native date picker in HTML is a bit of a pain to work with as it's overly simplistic in features and how you have to assign and retrieve values from it. It also isn't customizable so if you need to build custom behavior like a button date popup that doesn't show the input control, you're out of luck. In this post I discuss the challenges of the HTML date picker control, provide small component to make binding values easier, and provide an example on how to create a button only date picker both with plain JavaScript and as a small Vue component."
