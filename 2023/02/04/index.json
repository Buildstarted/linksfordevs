It is now finished. Well, I say “finished” – a book is never “finished”. There is that joke that “finished software is like a mown lawn”, and it is quite fitting for books, too. In traditional publishing you couldn’t change an already published book, but with ebooks it is always possible to tinker here and there. This means that most probably, I will tinker with it a bit. Don’t worry, though – I do not plan to delete anything (only improve or add things), I definitely won’t do it too often – I have a lot of other things to do! – and I intend to mention any substantial changes in the release notes sent to readers who decide to receive emails about new editions."
