    "Description": "When creating a container for a single-page application with JavaScript frameworks like Angular, React, or Vue.js, we may have to inject certain configuration variables based the deployment environment. A common scenario is using API endpoint URL for the Javascript application which can vary depend on the environment. In Angular, we can use environment file for this purpose. But again the problem is we have to hard code the API URL in the environment file. In this post we will explore how we can do configure container environment variable in vanilla Javascript. This technique can be used in any Javascript framework or technology."
