    "Description": "I spent a recent flight finding out what I could do with a connection to the flight‚Äôs wifi, but without access to the internet.\nI was on my way home from Strange Loop, a direct flight from St. Louis to Oakland. It‚Äôs a long enough flight that I planned to purchase the $8 internet access and get some work done, but Southwest‚Äôs wifi portal wouldn‚Äôt accept any form of payment. The web page didn‚Äôt give me any helpful error messages, so I opened up my browser‚Äôs network dev tools to see if I could figure out what was going wrong."
