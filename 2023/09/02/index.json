    "Description": "Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a\ngreat deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these\nmodels in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been\nsome success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against\nLLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method\nthat causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.\nSpecifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range\nof queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the\nprobability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than\nrefusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our\napproach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of\ngreedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past\nautomatic prompt generation methods.\n  Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach\nare quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.\nSpecifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,\nqueries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as\nmultiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting\nattack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces\nto ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,\nPythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the\nstate-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models,\nraising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from\nproducing objectionable information. Code is available at\ngithub.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks."

    "Description": "Overview of Research : Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude undergo extensive fine-tuning to not produce harmful content in their responses to user questions.  Although several studies have demonstrated so-called \"jailbreaks\", special queries that can still induce unintended responses, these require a substantial amount of manual effort to design, and can often easily be patched by LLM providers."

    "Description": "Modern software applications rarely work in isolation. On the contrary, a typical application will talk to several external systems like databases, messaging systems, cache providers, and many 3rd party services. And it's up to you to ensure everything functions correctly.\nHopefully, I don't have to convince you about the value of writing tests.\nYou should be writing tests. Period.\nHowever, I do want to discuss the value of integration testing.\nUnit tests are helpful to test business logic in isolation, without any external services. They are easy to write and provide almost instant feedback.\nBut you can't be fully confident in your application without integration tests.\nSo, in this week's newsletter, I'll show you how to use Docker for integration testing.\nHere's what we will use to write integration tests:\n- Testcontainers - Docker - xUnit\nLet's dive in!"
