The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn&rsquo;t suitably scalable for anyone&rsquo;s queueing needs. The cult of scalability would rather we build applications that scale beyond our wildest dreams than ones that solve real problems beyond our wildest dreams."
