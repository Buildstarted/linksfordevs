It has many improvements: more tag support (busway, embankment, cuisine, solar plants, aquaculture, pitch, sea, tree etc.), CJK fonts, etc. There is \nalso better internationalisation: country specific road shields, peaks \nusing imperial system in the US, hierarchical place rendering in China, etc.\n#OpenStreetMap #OSM #gischat #maps"

The scalability cult has decreed that there are several queue technologies with greater &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; than Postgres, and for that reason alone, Postgres isn&rsquo;t suitably scalable for anyone&rsquo;s queueing needs. The cult of scalability would rather we build applications that scale beyond our wildest dreams than ones that solve real problems beyond our wildest dreams."
