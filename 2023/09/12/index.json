However, the costs of an in-memory cache database could become significant for larger-scale projects. In this blog post, I'll describe optimizing the Rails caching mechanism using the Brotli compression algorithm instead of the default Gzip. I'll also discuss a more advanced technique of using in-memory cache for extreme performance bottlenecks."

I had the hunch that the existing tooling we have to interface with our object formats, such as ELF, are antiquated and ill specified. Declarative languages, such as SQL, are such a wonderful abstraction to articulate over data layouts and let you reason about what you want rather than how to get it. Since continuing to noodle 👨‍💻 on the project, I’ve been pleasantly surprised at some of the introspection, specifically with respect to symbols, I’ve been able to accomplish with SQL that would have been a pain using traditional tools."
