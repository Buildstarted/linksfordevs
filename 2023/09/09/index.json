    "Description": "How often do you think about concurrency conflicts when writing code?\nYou write the code for a new feature, confirm that it works, and call it a day.\nBut one week later, you find out you introduced a nasty bug because you didn't think about concurrency.\nThe most common issue is race conditions with two competing threads executing the same function. If you don't consider this during development, you introduce the risk of leaving the system in a corrupted state.\nIn this week's newsletter, I'll challenge you to spot the race condition in a method for reserving a booking. The business requirement is you can't have two overlapping reservations for the same dates.\nAnd then, I'll show you how to solve this race condition using EF Core optimistic concurrency.\nLet's dive in!"

My mental model is similar to writing a text. The first pass will rarely get published. Each section gets many rewrites. Sometimes the entire thing gets thrown out."
