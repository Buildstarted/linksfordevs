I think people with such opinions either don't care about code quality or simply don't know what TypeScript is. Here, I will explain why you should use TypeScript."

If you don't consider this during development, you introduce the risk of leaving the system in a corrupted state.\nIn this week's newsletter, I'll challenge you to spot the race condition in a method for reserving a booking. The business requirement is you can't have two overlapping reservations for the same dates.\nAnd then, I'll show you how to solve this race condition using EF Core optimistic concurrency.\nLet's dive in!"
