    "Description": "If you've gotten into the home automation thing in the past few years, \nit's possible you set up some Philips Hue devices along the way.  This \nwas an ecosystem which had a bunch of bulbs, switches, outlets and a hub \nthat spoke Zigbee on one side and Ethernet on the other.  It was pretty \nmuch no-nonsense, never dropped commands, and just sat there and worked.  \nAlso, it integrated with the Apple Homekit ecosystem perfectly."
