    "Timestamp": "2023-09-14T22:03:22",
    "Domain": "le.qun.ch",
    "Description": "As open-source pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) become more powerful and permissive, more and more users are incorporating LLMs into their projects. An essential adaptation step is the integration of domain-specific documents into the pre-trained model, known as fine-tuning. Often, the additional knowledge from domain-specific documents is minuscule compared to what the pre-trained model already knows. In such scenarios, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique proves valuable. With LoRA, a fine-tuned model adds fewer than 0.1% of parameters to the pre-trained model. In concrete terms, this means a LoRA fine-tuned model increases storage by only 10~200 MB, depending on the configuration. From a computational standpoint, given the marginal increase in parameters compared to the pre-trained model, the additional computational load is relatively small. Considering the minimal storage addition and computational overhead, I believe there‚Äôs potential in developing a multitenancy fine-tuned LLM serving service. This service could host thousands of LoRA models, all sharing the same backbone LLM. With batching, each user request would invoke a distinct fine-tuned model, thereby amortizing storage and computational costs across various models. In my previous blog post, I delved into the batching effects in LLM serving. In this post, I‚Äôll detail why multitenancy LoRA serving has immense potential."

To achieve a streamlined visual layout and save space, consider displaying only the headers and revealing the details upon selection. With the Expander control from the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit, this vision is entirely attainable. Join me, and I'll guide you step-by-step to a implementation. üíï\nThe explanation will be divided into the following points:\n\n\nüîπ .NET MAUI Community Toolkit: Implementation\nüîπ ¬†What is a Expander?\nüîπ ¬†How to implement it?\n\n\n\n\nüîß¬†First of all... What do I need to know?\nWhat is .NET MAUI Community Toolkit??\n\n \tIt‚Äôs a collection of reusable elements such as animations, behaviors ¬†converters, among others, for developing applications for iOS, Android, macOS and WinUI using MAUI.\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Important!¬†Adding this configuration to your project just once is enough to fully benefit from the Community Toolkit.

Each one of these includes specific properties that help in the Expander configuration.\nLet's see a preview of what the structure should be like, and consequently we will start detailing the explanation.\n\n\nHowever, before delving into incorporating the two previously mentioned elements, it is important to add the tags that will house them. To establish this foundation, you simply need to integrate the following tags provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\nüîπ Header\nThe header remains constantly in view, and a simple click or tap will expand or hide the content. Ensure you populate it with read-only material, steering clear of controls demanding further user engagement.\nExactly where it says <!-- The Header element goes here--> in the previous block, add the <Expander.Header> tags, here¬†you can add all the visual elements you need, for this example I have only added a Label.\n\n\nüîπ Content\nThe content is what the user will see when interacting with the header, fluidly alternating between its visibility and hiding each time the header is selected.\nThe integration is intuitive and you do not need additional tags. Once you've set your header tags, simply add an element to hold the detailed content. For this example I will use the VerticalStackLayout, within the layout I can add all the visual elements I need.\n\nüö´ Limitations\n‚ûñ Expander does not support ListView on iOS/MacCatalyst.\n\n\n\n\nAnd done! üòé From now on, you are ready to use Expander in your .NET MAUI applications! üíöüíï\n\n<Label Text=‚ÄùThanks for reading!¬†üëã ‚Äù />\n\nSpanish post:\n\n \thttps://es.askxammy.com/explorando-el-expander-de-net-maui-community-toolkit/\n\nReferences:\n\n \thttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/maui/views/expander#basic-usage?tabs=ios?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-50033\n"
