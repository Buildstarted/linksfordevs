    "Description": "Validation is an essential cross-cutting concern that you need to solve in your application. You want to ensure the request is valid before you consider processing it.\nAnother important question you need to answer is how you approach different types of validation. For example, I consider input and business validation differently, and each deserves a specific solution.\nI want to show you an elegant solution for validation using MediatR and FluentValidation.\nIf you aren't using CQRS with MediatR, don't worry. Everything I explain about validation can easily be adapted to other paradigms."
