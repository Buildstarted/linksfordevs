    "Description": "When I first released SETT, a common bit of feedback I’d get was, “It’s nice, but it’s really slow”. This shouldn’t have been too surprising to me, given that I hadn’t spent any time optimizing it, and didn’t know how to, anyway. So I sat down and decided to fix the problem. Now SETT is extremely fast, despite running on a single server with a 6 year old processor. It’s far faster than WordPress, but still a bit slower than Tumblr, which is incredibly fast."

The “flow”, described informally, represents the evolution of the program during execution time, that is, at which the CPU jumps in order to continue program execution.\nThe graph (also called CFG for brevity) allows the first high-level elements of software to be derived in a general way from a low- or medium-level representation (we cite as an example assembly code or intermediate code)."
