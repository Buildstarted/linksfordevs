    "Description": "Even though many scientists are expected to abide by the principles of open, rigorous and reproducible research, few scientists actually receive formal training in this. Indeed, there is no collection written by workings scientis for working scientists about the principles of open, rigorous and transparent research and how to go about practicing such research, beyond theory. This handbook represents a constantly updated guide aiming to fulfil this gap and by doing so actively assist all researchers in producing informative research."
