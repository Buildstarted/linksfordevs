It feels time to share some experiences and observations of the state and future of small manufacturing.  Most people experience supply chain issues as simply not being able to purchase something, or only being able to do so at a greatly inflated markup. But another situation emerged that is even more frustrating: the potentially great difficulty of repairing existing things as a result of replacement parts either ..."

Volexity strongly recommends that all organizations block external access to their Confluence Server instances immediately until an update is provided by Atlassian. Over the Memorial Day weekend in the United States, Volexity conducted an incident response investigation involving two Internet-facing web servers belonging to one of its customers that were running Atlassian Confluence Server software. The investigation began after suspicious activity was detected on the hosts, which included JSP webshells being written to disk. Volexity immediately used Volexity Surge Collect Pro to collect system memory and key files from the Confluence Server systems for analysis. After a thorough review of the collected data, Volexity was able to determine the server compromise stemmed from an attacker launching an exploit to achieve remote code execution. Volexity was subsequently able to recreate that exploit and identify […]"
