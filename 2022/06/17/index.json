    "Description": "I love movies, so as a fun exercise for my fast.ai course, I created an app - which you can use here - that lets you search frames from YouTube videos based on the text you type in. It’s named “It Happened One Frame”, in tribute to the classic 1934 romantic comedy “It Happened One Night”."

    "Description": "Feel free to join the discussion on HackerNews.\n In the early 2020 I was working in the Distributed Queries team of YDB. YDB is a Distributed SQL Database that combines high availability and scalability with strong consistency and ACID transactions. One of my key tasks there was to develop new storage format for JSON data. YDB recently became open source, so I can now share some interesting technical details behind this journey."

    "Description": "A completely valid criticism of this project could be: Adama is an over-engineered bespoke piece of infrastructure in search of a problem. Fair. I had a great conversation a few weeks ago, and one of the things that occurred to me is that I’m sitting on a super power. Namely, I solved a problem of turning infrastructure into user-generated content. Allow me to ramble, dig into this, and expand."
