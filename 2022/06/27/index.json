    "Description": "This document was originally called a \"Code of Conduct\" and\nwas created for the purpose of filling in a box on \"supplier registration\"\nforms submitted to the SQLite developers by some clients.  However,\nwe subsequently learned that \"Code of Conduct\" has a very specific and\nalmost sacred meaning to some readers, a meaning to which this\ndocument does not conform\n[1][2][3].\nTherefore this document was renamed to \"Code of Ethics\", as\nwe are encouraged to do by rule 71 in particular and also rules 2, 8, 9, 18, 19,\n30, 66, and in the spirit of all the rest."
