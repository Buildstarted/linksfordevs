    "Description": "This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext\n        Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more\n        efficient use of network resources and a\n        reduced latency by introducing field compression and allowing multiple\n        concurrent exchanges on the same connection. \n       This document obsoletes RFCs 7540 and 8740."
