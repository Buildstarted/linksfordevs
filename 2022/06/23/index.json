Among other things,\nthis news gave some impetus to the longstanding\neffort to support a more robust hash algorithm in the Git source-code\nmanagement system.  As time has passed, though, that work seems to have\nslowed to a stop, leaving some users wondering when, if ever, Git will\nsupport a hash algorithm other than SHA-1."

Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop\none of those earlier projects, to allow\nPython scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to\nmuch of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact\nwith the browser document object model (DOM) directly. \nIn addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk."
