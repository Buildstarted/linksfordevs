    "Description": "In a keynote at PyCon 2022 in Salt\nLake City, Utah, Peter Wang introduced another entrant in the field of\nin-browser Python interpreters.  The Python community has long sought a way\nto be able to write Python—instead of JavaScript—to run in web browsers, and there\nhave been various efforts to do so over the years.  Wang announced PyScript as a new framework, built atop\none of those earlier projects, to allow\nPython scripting directly within the browser; those programs have access to\nmuch of the existing Python ecosystem as well as being able to interact\nwith the browser document object model (DOM) directly. \nIn addition, he gave some rather eye-opening demonstrations as part of the talk."
