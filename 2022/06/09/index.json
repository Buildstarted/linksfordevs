Often there isn't really a way. But if you work in software development. Then there is always a way; that way is code review! When done correctly, code review can be an excellent tool to help improve code quality and spread core knowledge throughout a team. But when done incorrectly, it can be the bain of someone's life. It is a fantastic place to get your own back via passive-aggressive actions. Are they too good? Do they never refill the coffee pot? Did they not say good morning to you one time 3-years ago when they didn't realise you were in the office? Now is the time to take it out on them during code review!"
