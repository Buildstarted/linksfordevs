    "Description": "Nuclear power currently makes up slightly less than 20% of the total electricity produced in the US, largely from plants built in the 70s and 80s. People are often enthusiastic about greater use of nuclear power as a potential strategy for decarbonizing electricity production, as well as its theoretical potential for being able to produce electricity extremely cheaply. (Nuclear power also has some other attractive qualities, such as less risk of disruption due to fuel-supply issues, which for instance can impact natural gas plants during periods of cold.) But increased use of nuclear power has been hampered by the fact that nuclear power plant construction cost has steadily, dramatically increased over time, frequently over the life of a single project. For instance, in the 1980s"

Often there isn't really a way. But if you work in software development. Then there is always a way; that way is code review! When done correctly, code review can be an excellent tool to help improve code quality and spread core knowledge throughout a team. But when done incorrectly, it can be the bain of someone's life. It is a fantastic place to get your own back via passive-aggressive actions. Are they too good? Do they never refill the coffee pot? Did they not say good morning to you one time 3-years ago when they didn't realise you were in the office? Now is the time to take it out on them during code review!"
