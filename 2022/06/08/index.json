In GitHub actions, OWASP ZAP provides a baseline scan feature which helps to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks. The ZAP baseline action scans a target URL for vulnerabilities and maintains an issue in GitHub repository for the identified alerts. We can configure this action in Github public and private repositories. To get started first create an empty GitHub repository. And once it is created, click on the Actions tab. Either choose the Skip this and set up a workflow yourself option or select Simple workflow actions."
