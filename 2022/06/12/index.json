While in the early days, it was primarly for NodeJS and backend use (with Bower acting as the frontend equivalent), it is now used consistantly across the stack. I use NPM at least 100 times a day; Not just for installing and managing packages but for managing scripts, git hooks and test suites. npm run dev, npm run test and npm run test:changes are all so frequently typed that I can access them in my terminal consistently within 2-3 presses of the up key."
