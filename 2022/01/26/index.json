Similarly, cloud storage services are getting increasingly important as file systems are the only truly cross-platform mechanisms in sharing data between devices, yet none of the off-the-shelf offerings is working well. Unless one confines themselves (and the people they interact with) within the walled gardens of Apple, Google, or Microsoft, it is prohibitively expensive and/or difficult to break free."
