That said I think a strong case can be\nmade for using one of the several more modern languages that have sprung up in\nthe systems programming space, at least for newly written code. I make no secret\nthat I love Rust and Zig both, for many similar reasons. But I also find Nim to\nbe impressive and have heard great things about Odin. There is, frankly, room for\nmore than one."
