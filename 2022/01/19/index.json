    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "We introduce Zef, the first Byzantine-Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol to\nsupport payments in anonymous digital coins at arbitrary scale. Zef follows the\ncommunication and security model of FastPay: both protocols are asynchronous,\nlow-latency, linearly-scalable, and powered by partially-trusted sharded\nauthorities. In contrast with FastPay, user accounts in Zef are\nuniquely-identified and safely removable. Zef coins are bound to an account by\na digital certificate and otherwise stored off-chain by their owners. To create\nand redeem coins, users interact with the protocol via privacy-preserving\noperations: Zef uses randomized commitments and NIZK proofs to hide coin\nvalues; and, created coins are made unlinkable using the blind and randomizable\nthreshold anonymous credentials of Coconut. Besides the detailed specifications\nand our analysis of the protocol, we are making available an open-source\nimplementation of Zef in Rust. Our extensive benchmarks on AWS confirm textbook\nlinear scalability and demonstrate a confirmation time under one second at\nnominal capacity. Compared to existing anonymous payment systems based on a\nblockchain, this represents a latency speedup of three orders of magnitude,\nwith no theoretical limit on throughput."
