But they aren't the only ones who struggle. Often forgotten are the loved ones of a person with depression. No-one tells them how to cope. They don't know what to do. I would like to try and offer some advice to those people. Knowing somebody you love is struggling with depression leaves you feeling incredibly helpless."
