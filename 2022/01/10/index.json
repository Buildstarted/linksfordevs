    "Description": "Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. Blazor supports multiple hosting models... Blazor Server utilizes SignalR to host your application on a web server, and Blazor WebAssembly utilizes Wasm, an open web standard that does not require plugins or code transpilation in order to run natively in a web browser. Blazor applications works in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers. Blazor is a feature of ASP.NET, the popular web development framework from Microsoft that extends the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries for building web apps. If you are interested in some more detailed case studies about Blazor you can visit the Blazor Customers Showcase."
