It’s easier to block, unfriend, ignore, rather than engage. However, have you considered that avoiding conflicts might make things worse? This is a question Luca Rossi and I asked ourselves as a part of our research on polarization on social media. Part of the answer comes from an Agent Based Model (ABM) we have recently published on Plos One in the paper “How Minimizing Conflicts Could Lead to Polarization on Social Media: an Agent-Based Model Investigation.”"

This time on why, after working on this mess for seven years, I still think NIR was the right call."

When she interacts with the information in her workspace, it seems to be alive, aware of when and how it was last used, and sometimes even why she was using it."

For instance: import styles from \"./styles.css\" A few months ago it would not have been possible out of the shelf. Indeed you would need a bundler (such as WebPack, Rollup,…) to “inline” the CSS file as a string in your Javascript file. Nowadays it’s possible thanks to the “CSS Modules” (to not confuse with the homonym open-source project)."
