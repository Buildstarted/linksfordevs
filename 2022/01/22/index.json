    "Description": "Since the Report Viewer control was first introduced over a decade ago, it has been a key component that allowed developers to surface report content easily in their applications. But although the application development landscape has changed significantly since that time, support for the control is limited to both WinForms and WebForms. With the introduction of new, cross-platform options starting with .NET Core in 2016, we’re focusing our investments on new capabilities in Microsoft Power BI to fill this need for you and your customers moving forward."

At the start of 2021 I began working with a client that had an existing Elm frontend code base and an early stage backend built in Elixir and Phoenix. This post will be about my experiences running face first into Elm. I'll be vague on some details as I can't share too much about the specific client and code base. I'll be much less vague about Elm itself."
