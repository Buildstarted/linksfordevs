You can also create arbitrary major modes, create executers for them and you can start using them in your org-mode documents right away. Here is another example case: We use Couchbase quite a lot at work and I have bunch of queries saved in org-mode documents. It would be good to have an ob-n1ql package (N1QL is Couchbase's SQL-like language) that let's me run Couchbase queries right inside org-mode. I looked it up found no N1QL mode for Emacs, let alone a package like ob-n1ql for org-mode. But it was quite easy to roll my own, see this:"

    "Description": "Weâ€™ve been using a Sony Vaio VGN-P588E for the past few months as our primary personal laptop. This thingâ€™s great; itâ€™s got a small but not uncomfortable keyboard. Itâ€™s got a trackpoint, which we absolutely need to keep our hands healthy. Crucially, itâ€™s only 1.5 pounds. Weâ€™re disabled in a way that means weâ€™ve got to care about every bit of weight we add to our bag when we leave home, so thatâ€™s a big deal! One catch: the Intel Atom inside hits a peak speed of 1.33GHz, with a normal speed of 800MHz under most thermal conditions. Oh yeah and thereâ€™s only 2GB of DDR2, GPU drivers donâ€™t work in Linux, and itâ€™s a 32 bit processor too did I say one catch I meant four. Letâ€™s talk about life in the slow lane."
