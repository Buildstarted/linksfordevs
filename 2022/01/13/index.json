    "Description": "\nUpdate Jan 13: This post is discussed on Reddit\n\n\nAs software developers, we’ve all come across those annoying, not-so-useful error messages when using some library or framework: \"Couldn’t parse config file\", \"Lacking permission for this operation\", etc.\nOk, ok, so something went wrong apparently; but what exactly? What config file? Which permissions? And what should you do about it?\nError messages lacking this kind of information quickly create a feeling of frustration and helplessness.\n\n\nSo what makes a good error message then?\nTo me, it boils down to three pieces of information which should be conveyed by an error message:\n\n\n\n\nContext: What led to the error? What was the code trying to do when it failed?\n\n\nThe error itself: What exactly failed?\n\n\nMitigation: What needs to be done in order to overcome the error?\n\n\n"
