    "Description": "In a traditional .NET distributed application, application services (not to be confused with the Kubernetes ‘service’ object) would either be written as IIS hosted web applications or Windows Services. When building .NET (micro)services to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster pretty much every facet of the service needs to be reconsidered, not only the hosting environment but the way configuration is accessed, how logging and monitoring work, and the options for state management and memory considerations. In this post I’ll bring my experience of migrating .NET applications to Kubernetes to enumerate some of the main ways that you’ll need to change the way you write them."
