Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them."

Shadower started as a command line application that allowed us to read a local file to load test a local application. At the time, Maps PEs were heavily investing in Java GC tuning. We needed Shadower to be able to do request mirroring to make sure two different applications get about the same load and different types of loads (test multiple endpoints). In summary, we were starting the same application twice: once with the production configuration and once"

When building .NET (micro)services to be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster pretty much every facet of the service needs to be reconsidered, not only the hosting environment but the way configuration is accessed, how logging and monitoring work, and the options for state management and memory considerations. In this post I’ll bring my experience of migrating .NET applications to Kubernetes to enumerate some of the main ways that you’ll need to change the way you write them."
