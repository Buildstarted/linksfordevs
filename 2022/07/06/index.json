    "Description": "The SSH protocol, version 2, is one of the foundations of modern and secure computer networks. It is cryptographically sound, fast, incredibly versatile, and virtually ubiquitous. Not even the largest cloud providers try to replace it with some alternative, proprietary solution of their own, which should only amplify its staying power. Even better still, the most popular and comprehensive implementation you will find is proper Free Software, brought to you by the great OpenSSH project. For the tiniest of embedded platforms, there are decently complete alternatives available, and interoperability between them is generally very robust."

Digital transformation has brought more and more businesses into the cloud, and many more businesses have started their lives as cloud native over the last decade. With the growing sentiment of cloud agnosticism, the fear of vendor lock-in, and the availability of highly configurable approaches to deploying infrastructure as code, there’s never been a better opportunity to sieze a portion of a growing and exciting market."
