I pull it together to realize it’s a call from a number I do not know - never a good sign. I answer and it is a coworker - my peer who runs our support team that is engaged in nearly all production issues for our customers. “Hi Ryan. Sorry to wake you, I know it’s early. Our biggest customer is reporting their requests are taking over two hours to return results. We think it’s because of our messaging system but we aren’t sure where to go from here. We need your help. Please join our call.” A few moments later my watch buzzed again as my morning alarm sounded. Today, this morning will not be for a workout.\n\n"

Generally the top contenders are egui, Iced, and Druid, but web-based approaches are in the running, and of course there’s always the temptation to just build a new one. And every couple or months or so, a post appears with a new GUI toolkit."
