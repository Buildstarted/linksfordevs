    "Description": "This post is about customizing the scaffold templates controllers and views in ASP.NET Core. We can achieve this by simply modifying the templates in this folder - %USERPROFILE%\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.visualstudio.web.codegenerators.mvc\\6.0.6\\Templates (the number 6.0.6 will change based on the SDK version) - but if we modify the template files in this folder it will impact the whole system and we can’t share the templates with other developers. So we can create a folder with name Templates in the ASP.NET Core MVC project - while scaffolding, Visual Studio and dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator global tool will first check this folder in your project and if it is available it will use the templates from this folder."
