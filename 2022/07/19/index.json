    "Timestamp": "2022-07-19T01:02:27",
    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "This paper introduces a new type of attack on isolated, air-gapped\nworkstations. Although air-gap computers have no wireless connectivity, we show\nthat attackers can use the SATA cable as a wireless antenna to transfer radio\nsignals at the 6 GHz frequency band. The Serial ATA (SATA) is a bus interface\nwidely used in modern computers and connects the host bus to mass storage\ndevices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. The\nprevalence of the SATA interface makes this attack highly available to\nattackers in a wide range of computer systems and IT environments. We discuss\nrelated work on this topic and provide technical background. We show the design\nof the transmitter and receiver and present the implementation of these\ncomponents. We also demonstrate the attack on different computers and provide\nthe evaluation. The results show that attackers can use the SATA cable to\ntransfer a brief amount of sensitive information from highly secured, air-gap\ncomputers wirelessly to a nearby receiver. Furthermore, we show that the attack\ncan operate from user mode, is effective even from inside a Virtual Machine\n(VM), and can successfully work with other running workloads in the background.\nFinally, we discuss defense and mitigation techniques for this new air-gap\nattack."
