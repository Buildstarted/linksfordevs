    "Domain": "spencerfarley.com",
    "Description": "Type-driven and Domain-driven approaches commonly represent constrained values as a type. This approach is good, but generally leaves the constraints implicitly buried in functions. FsSpec exposes those constraints as data so they can be programmatically understood for validation, data generation, and more.\nShort Motivation FsSpec represents value constraints as data to reuse one constraint declaration for validation, data generation, error explanation, and more.\nIt also makes for a concise and consistent Type-Driven approach"
