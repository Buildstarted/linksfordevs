    "Description": "It seems like every company these days has two things they turn to when first hitting an incident. a) Is there an Alert Reference / Runbook / Whatever (the actual term depends on who you talk to), and b) Is there a dashboard that can tell me exactly whatâ€™s wrong. In this post, Iâ€™m going to cover why these tools are not only unhelpful, but are actively harmful to your incident response."

The rationale is that you're only exposed to \n\t\t\t\t\tthe strengths of others, and not their weaknesses. Instead of seeing a balanced \n\t\t\t\t\timage of a normal person, you might see a superhuman which can cause you \n\t\t\t\t\tto feel insecure, self-conscious, demotivated or burnt out."
