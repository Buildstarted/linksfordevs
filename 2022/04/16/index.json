We can do this opening Azure B2C tenant and click on the Applications menu. Next click on the New Registration button. And in the screen provide name, select the Account type as Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows), configure the redirect URL as https://jwt.ms/ - it is because I will be getting the token from this website and using the token I am accessing the azure function, keep the check on Grant admin consent to openid and offline_access permissions option under permissions."
