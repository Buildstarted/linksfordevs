Back when I started, we had just a single Bash script that covered everything we though we needed at the time. Now, we have 30,000+ lines of Python code (including tests I have to admit) that depend directly on 50 Python packages. Most of these packages are ones you might expect such as requests, pylint, or black. However, 13 are our own and shared with others. Of those 13, 9 are open source and available for the general community. A further 3 out of the 50 packages we use are my own creation from outside work. While some are personal, and some were created at work, all the tools listed in this post were created by me."

    "Description": "If you follow the crypto market, you may already be familiar with the strong direct correlation between cryptocurrencies prices, native or tokenized. When BTC goes down, pretty much everything goes down with it, and when BTC is up, everything is most likely to go up too. This correlation isn’t exclusive to BTC, impacts on the price of many other cryptocurrencies (such as ETH) also reverberate across a wide range of crypto assets, with different degrees of strength among them."
