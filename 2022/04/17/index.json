    "Description": "The Freedom Phone advertises itself as a \"Free speech and privacy first focused phone\". As documented on the features page, it runs ClearOS, an Android-based OS produced by Clear United (or maybe one of the bewildering array of associated companies, we'll come back to that later). It's advertised as including Signal, but what's shipped is not the version available from the Signal website or any official app store - instead it's this fork called \"ClearSignal\"."
