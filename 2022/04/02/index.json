    "Description": "Ever since its introduction in the 2017 paper, Attention is All You Need, the Transformer model architecture has taken the deep-learning world by storm. Initially introduced for machine translation, it has become the tool of choice for a wide range of domains, including text, audio, video, and others. Transformers have also driven most of the massive increases in model scale and capability in the last few years. OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Codex models are Transformers, as are DeepMind’s Gopher models and many others."

    "Description": "Our thoughts are our experience in this world, and our worries, memories, and plans are the only real testimony to our existence. Moment by moment, it feels like we are thinking about what’s naturally important, but in reality we each focus only on a minuscule subset. Equally surprising is that we dwell on different subsets from those around us—each of us lives a unique internal life. Our thoughts are partially under our control and partially not, but they are all we really have, and they just pass through."

I didn’t expect much interest, but someone posted the link to Hacker News, and I got enough requests that it was a little overwhelming. I’ve now reviewed 196 READMEs, my queue is empty, and I’m suspending the offer for now, even if it has been fun."

You can see the full list of pieces here!\nAlso, CW: grody gross-up pictures of bugs.\nI’ve always loved science. At one time, I thought it’d be my career: I got BAs in math and physics with the hope of eventually becoming a physicist. But my friend’s horror stories of grad school scared me off and I instead left academia and got a job programming."
