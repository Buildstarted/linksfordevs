User researchers tell the designers what the users need. And the product manager tells them all to hurry up. So, what does a DS do?"

    "Description": "Gradient-descent-based optimizers have long been used as the optimization algorithm of choice for deep learning models. Over the years, various modifications to the basic mini-batch gradient descent have been proposed, such as adding momentum or Nesterovâ€™s Accelerated Gradient (Sutskever et al., 2013), as well as the popular Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014). The paper Learning to Learn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent (Andrychowicz et al., 2016) demonstrates how the optimizer itself can be replaced with a simple neural network, which can be trained end-to-end. In this post, we will see how JAX, a relatively new Python library for numerical computing, can be used to implement a version of the optimizer introduced in the paper."

I was torn between considering two different paths: (1) leading engineering at a very small startup, or (2) taking a much smaller role at a fast growing company, with the expectation that growth would create opportunity."
