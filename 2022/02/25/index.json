    "Description": "Despite its generally fast-moving nature, the kernel project relies on a\nnumber of old tools.  While critics like to focus on the community's\nextensive use of email, a possibly more significant anachronism is the use\nof the 1989 version of the C language standard for kernel code â€” a standard\nthat was codified before the kernel project even began over 30 years ago.\nIt is looking like that longstanding practice could be coming to an end as\nsoon as the 5.18 kernel, which can be expected in May of this year."
