I would also say that it’s in their best interest, although it’s certainly a trade off. Most people still don’t use password managers, so stricter requirements will lead to some people losing access to their accounts. Still though, forcing people to use even moderately strong passwords will help prevent account takeovers and all the headaches that go along with them."

It had refreshed, not into some absurd wonderland of glowing fungi and strange creatures, but to one consistent with what you believed a room ought to be. Perhaps there was a lightswitch outside, that now instead of turning on the fluorescent globe, turned on a LED one. Maybe the books on the shelves had refreshed, but the ones you remembered and remembered reading, had remained. The size of the room was constrained, because you remembered how long it took to walk around the outside. Given your means and taste, it was appropriately furnished. Perhaps you walked into the room because you forgot where you left your keys, and encountered a lovely couch (green, your favourite) and found the keys wedged between the cushions. This made perfect sense because you remembered sitting in that room. But, when you were there, you actually sat on a red couch, and didn’t have your keys. But, your keys refreshed there, because you forgot where you left them."

    "Description": "Postgres supports three types for \"schemaless\" data: JSON (added in 9.2), JSONB (added in 9.4), and HSTORE (added in 8.2 as an extension). Unfortunately, the performance of queries of all three gets substantially slower (2-10×) for values larger than about 2 kiB, due to how Postgres stores long variable-length data (TOAST). The same performance cliff applies to any variable-length types, like TEXT and BYTEA. This article contains some quick-and-dirty benchmark results to explore how Postgres's performance changes for the \"schemaless\" data types when they become large. My conclusion is that you should expect a 2-10× slower queries once a row gets larger than Postgres's 2 kiB limit."
