    "Description": "Last year, I raised $100k from friends to run fully-staked validator nodes on 3 different blockchains. We made $300k and learned a lot. Hereâ€™s the stuff I found interesting:\nInconsistent Rewards These networks werenâ€™t designed explicitly to infuriate little node operators, but it can seem that way. This is a general problem with proof-of-stake blockchains:\n They incentivize computers to do useful things Because distributed state is hard, they pseudo-randomly elect a little group of computers at any given time to actually do the useful thing Therefore, the computers spend very little time doing the useful thing, so the earnings are sporadic  Every proof-of-stake system has this randomness in the earnings."

That is, if you \nstarted something, it might inherit one or more things from your \nenvironment.  Likewise, if you ran something with an unusual \nenvironment, it might bestow those \"gifts\" onto anything it happened to \ntouch."
