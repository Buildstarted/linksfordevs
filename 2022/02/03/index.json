However, we couldn’t find any information regarding other sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer in the files; not even any GPIO references or I²C bus addresses. Unlike Android devices, which run a fork of the Linux kernel, we can’t go and look at the downstream kernel source - so I delved into the schematics to find out."
