Few days back I got a question / comment in the blog post about Minimal APIs - about implementing Basic authentication in Minimal APIs. Since the Action Filters support is not available in Minimal API I had to find some alternative approach for the implementation. I already wrote two blog posts Basic authentication middleware for ASP.NET 5 and Basic HTTP authentication in ASP.Net Web API on implementing Basic authentication. In this post I am implementing an AuthenticationHandler and using this for implementing basic authentication. As I already explained enough about the concepts, I am not discussing them again in this post."

What is server-side rendering - A normal Angular application executes within the browser, rendering pages within the DOM in response to user actions. Angular Universal executes on the server, generating static application pages that later get bootstrapped on the consumer. This implies that the appliance usually renders additional quickly, giving users an opportunity to look at the appliance layout before it becomes totally interactive."

Every text, every website, every important email: you've twisted words, deleted sentences, and rewritten. Often enough you crumpled things up afterwards and threw them away.

I probably could not answer this question to the satisfaction of the interviewer, but that is likely because the interviewer has a specific answer in mind that pertains only to a specific scenario. That the question presupposes the existence of a \"main thread\" implies that there is a second thread involved; that's common but by no means required or universal. I understand the feature primarily from the language design perspective, not from the behind-the-scenes low-level implementation details of the runtime."
