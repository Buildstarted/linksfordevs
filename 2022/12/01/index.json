Guess what, there might come some new handy additions for the upcoming .NET 8 iteration.\nSo let's see what are those new changes and how they make the code simpler.\n"

    "Description": "Steve works with companies that want to avoid the trap of technical debt by helping their teams deliver quality software quickly. Steve and his team at NimblePros have been described by clients as a “force multiplier,” amplifying the value of existing development teams. Steve’s client list includes Microsoft, Quicken Loans, Celina Insurance, and many other satisfied customers. And he also offers career coaching to developers through Dev better.com. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [3:20] What is onion architecture? [4:07] Steve discusses Domain-Driven design. [5:15] Domain-Driven Design is all about how to take big complicated problems in software, and break them up into smaller pieces that we as developers can isolate, think about, design, test, and then construct together in a modular fashion with other pieces. [6:00] The key concepts of Domain-Driven Design. [9:13] How and why DDD came about. [12:28] Why Steve thinks about it in terms of having a bounded context per application that you deploy. [16:33] Historical records of things should always be duplicate data. There should be a snapshot of the data at that time. [17:06] Where should people begin if/when they are new to the book? [17:54] What exactly is clean architecture? [23:01] Steven talks about having one infrastructure project where there are all these dependencies versus multiple. [24:09] Steve names the three main projects. [30:49] Very mature and high-stakes professions have chosen to put constraints on themselves, and with positive effect. How can we take this into architecture and design? &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
