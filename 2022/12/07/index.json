I loved that laptop, but\ntime marches on and old hardware eventually becomes too slow for\nmodern development needs.  After a lot of indecision, I bought a 10th\ngeneration Thinkpad X1 with an Intel Core i7-1280P CPU, 32GB RAM, and\n1TB NVMe SSD.  While they don’t make Thinkpads like they used to, I’m\nstill really happy with it and glad I chose it.  Despite the keyboard\nchanges, the TrackPoint™ is still there and I don’t think I could feel\ngood using a laptop without it.  Below I will explain all the steps I\ntook to get the Guix distribution setup nicely on it.  Maybe it can\nhelp you setup your own Thinkpad X1 or some other computer that\nrequires more than what Guix provides for all of the hardware to work."
