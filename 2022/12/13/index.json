    "Description": "My team at birdie recently moved from a home-rolled event-sourcing library to Equinox in one of our services. Equinox describes itself as a set of low-dependency libraries allowing event-sourced processing against stream-based stores. While this description is technically accurate, a cursory look at the codebase reveals that a programming model has formed around the library over time. This article seeks to explore that programming model."

    "Description": "Sometimes among all the sprints, the pressure to ship faster, tools to measure lines of code written, it seems like we as an industry forget a simple fact: developers are knowledge workers, not robots To remind us what it means to be a human, we invited some of the most empathetic engineering leaders we know to Interact and asked them to sit on a panel together. The conversation that followed is one of the most insightful and relevant conversations we've heard all year. Whether you are an IC, manager or manager of managers, we promise this conversation will help you become a more empathetic leader and colleague."
