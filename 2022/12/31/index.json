    "Description": "As a hobby project over the past few weeks, I’ve been training neural networks to predict the prices of cars in photographs. Anybody with some experience in ML can probably guess what I did, at least on a high level: I scraped terabytes of data from the internet and trained a neural network on it. However, I ended up learning more than I expected to along this journey. For example, this was the first time I’ve observed clear and somewhat surprising positive transfer across prediction tasks. In particular, I found that predicting additional details about each car (e.g. make and model) improved the accuracy of price predictions. Additionally, I learned a few things about file systems, specifically EXT4, that threw me off guard. And finally, I used AI-powered image editing to uncover some interesting behaviors of my trained classifier."

My plan was to make a self-sustained system, using proper alarm hardware — like PIR sensors and sirens.\nIntegration with Home Assistant would be an add-on, not a requirement. I wanted the system to be as redundant and fault-tolerant as I could make it.\nThis is a pretty long story, with some twists and turns — let’s get into it 👇"
