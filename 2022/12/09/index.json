    "Description": "This post is a collection of things I learned about batteries. This is my adventure diving into why doing too much home office killed my laptop battery, and my journey replacing it. It is not necessarily data-driven, but at least data-intuited.\nMotivation Before the pandemic, my laptop (a ThinkPad) was on and off the charger. I was walking around university, sitting in lectures, going to the library. I would charge my laptop when the battery was getting low, and then disconnect the charger again."
