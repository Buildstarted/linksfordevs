    "Description": "A subquery is a type of query that is embeddedâ€”or nestedâ€”into a data manipulation language (DML) statement. The data returned by the subquery is passed into the DML statement and incorporated into its overall logic. The subquery itself is typically a SELECT statement, although you can also use a TABLE statement or VALUES statement. Even so, the SELECT statement continues to be the most common choice for subqueries, and thatâ€™s the one I focus on in this article."

We see little value in rewriting existing C# code to F# and do so only when major changes are due in existing C# code. As a result, we have quite a bit of C#-F# interop in our system. Both from C# to F# and from F# to C#. This post overviews what we learned about C#-F# interop."
