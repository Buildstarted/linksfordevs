However, a half-completed draft has been open in my browser this entire time, and I think it‚Äôd be a shame for it to go to waste and not celebrate all the work done on traits working-group related things and to celebrate the people who have done that amazing work. Given that this is ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù though, I‚Äôll be a little less formal than I otherwise would if this was posted to the Inside Rust Blog."
