    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Despite the existence of multiple great resources on zk-SNARK construction,\nfrom original papers to explainers, due to the sheer number of moving parts the\nsubject remains a black box for many. While some pieces of the puzzle are given\none can not see the full picture without the missing ones. Hence the focus of\nthis work is to shed light onto the topic with a straightforward and clean\napproach based on examples and answering many whys along the way so that more\nindividuals can appreciate the state of the art technology, its innovators and\nultimately the beauty of math. Paper's contribution is a simplistic exposition\nwith a sufficient and gradually increasing level of complexity, necessary to\nunderstand zk-SNARK without any prerequisite knowledge of the subject,\ncryptography or advanced math. The primary goal is not only to explain how it\nworks but why it works and how it came to be this way."

However, a half-completed draft has been open in my browser this entire time, and I think it’d be a shame for it to go to waste and not celebrate all the work done on traits working-group related things and to celebrate the people who have done that amazing work. Given that this is “unofficial” though, I’ll be a little less formal than I otherwise would if this was posted to the Inside Rust Blog."
