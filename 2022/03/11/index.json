    "Description": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) has become the de facto standard for protecting modern communications. ECC is widely used to perform asymmetric cryptography operations, such as to establish shared secrets or for digital signatures. However, insufficient validation of public keys and parameters is still a frequent cause of confusion, leading to serious vulnerabilities, such as leakage of secret keys, signature malleability or interoperability issues. The purpose of this blog post is to provide an illustrated description of the typical failures related to elliptic curve validation and how to avoid them in a clear and accessible way."
