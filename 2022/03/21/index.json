    "Description": "The Google.Protobuf NuGet package is the recommended protobuf serializer for .NET. The documented way of using it is to code gen both C# models and serializers from .proto files using the protoc tool. However, sometimes it’s more convenient to do serialization/deserialization on an ad-hoc basis without code generation. The Google.Protobuf NuGet package provides APIs to do this, but they are poorly documented. This post gives a code example for a simple “no-code-gen” serializer."

Despite doing good work, I handled change poorly, and I picked up the reputation for being difficult to manage.\nI’d like to say that I learned from my mistakes directly, but the honest version is that I came to understand this dynamic mostly through working with folks struggling from the same issue."
