    "Description": "I was an RPA developer for 4 years - from 2017 to 2021. In late 2019, I made one crucial decision\n        that led to my being chosen as one of\n        \n          UiPath's 62 MVPs for the year 2021. This decision was to stop keeping up with the latest\n          RPA trends and focus instead on mastering traditional software development."

You can try it by pressing “Start” (be sure to try both the sine wave and the frequency displays), and I’ll be walking through how it works below."

I started in September 2013 and wrote around 150 posts between then and when I started working at Wave. (At that point I stopped having nothing better to do, so my blogging frequency tanked.)\nThe outcomes of these 150 posts were extremely skewed:\n Two made it big on the Hacker News frontpage (What happened to all the non-programmers and Readability, hackability, and abstraction)."

    "Description": "Managing teams has taught me a lot about my own behaviors and motivations. For example, I overworked for a long time. This left me continually teetering on the brink of burnout, and I had no energy left to absorb the typical sorts of organizational changes that happen at any company. Despite doing good work, I handled change poorly, and I picked up the reputation for being difficult to manage.\nI’d like to say that I learned from my mistakes directly, but the honest version is that I came to understand this dynamic mostly through working with folks struggling from the same issue."
