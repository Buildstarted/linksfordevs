Fueled by this feedback, we simplified the getting started experience by focusing on the individual building block APIs (for example, service invocation or pub/sub). The new Quickstarts are at the root of the Quickstarts repo and currently show three of the APIs in five different languages, with the rest of the building block APIs being actively worked on over the coming weeks."
