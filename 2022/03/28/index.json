The cloud offers elastic capabilities that make this possible. When a lot of users visit your application, you can automatically scale your application to meet those needs. And when it isn't busy, your applications can scale back to minimize costs. Azure App Service Web Apps (opens new window) can do exactly that with autoscaling."

Each node can be one of four different types: Buffer, Constraint, Merge, and Split. A manufacturing system that we would want to simulate is typically made up of no more than 100 of these nodes. A natural way to encode these types would be to use Discriminated Unions (DU). I also use Units of Measure to annotate integers that are the ids for these manufacturing nodes."
