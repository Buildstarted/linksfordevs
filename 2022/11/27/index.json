For example, a peer-to-peer document storage system might need to sync an arbitrarily-nested directory\n    structure. The algorithm presented here is one way to do this. It comes from a family of algorithms called\n    CRDTs, which I will not describe\n    here. Unlike my original article\n      about this technique, the algorithm presented here does not require a central server, and works in true\n    peer-to-peer scenarios."
