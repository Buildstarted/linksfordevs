    "Description": "For more than 15 years I've built my own \"Home Automation\" components. Nothing fancy, though maybe back then it was. It started with some colored LED spots under my couch connected to my Ethernet via a micro controller.\nLater I added WiFi and 433MHz radio to control various remote switchable outlets. Some of them even were built into a light switch to control it. I even had Linux running in a light switch for some time.\nThen came my MagicMirror and with it the need for some presence detection based on WiFi. And so on, just to give you an introduction as to where this is coming from."
