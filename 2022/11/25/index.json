During the process I realized I had many wrong assumptions about integer\ndivisions, and also discovered some remarkably useful mathematical properties."

Maintaining code readability is a key object for every writer of software.\nAnd so any approach which allows us to achieve this should be adopted with fervour.\nIn the early days of structured programming, most code was written using an imperative approach.\nImperative code describes how a problem should be solved. In other words, imperative code specifies each step to be taken by the computer to transform input to output."
