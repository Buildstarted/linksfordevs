Short explanation: itâ€™s a repository of proofs of leftpad, in different proof systems.\nLong explanation: the rest of this post.\nBackground Iâ€™m into formal methods, the discipline of proving software correct. Consider the following contrived code:\ndef add(x: int, y: int): int { if(x == 12976 && y == 14867) { return x - y; } return x + y; }  This typechecks, and any black-box unit test would find that add(x, y) == x + y."
