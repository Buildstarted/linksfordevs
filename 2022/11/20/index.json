    "Description": "Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that\nenables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any\nsubject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)\nas determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to\ntypical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may\nbe decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate\nauthorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the\ndiscovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the\ncontroller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission\nfrom any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID\nsubject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions\nassociated with that subject."
