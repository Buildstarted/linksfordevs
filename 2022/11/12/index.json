    "Description": "Compared to other programming languages such as Python and Go, Rust's standard library is very small, including only core data structures in the standard library with all other functionality farmed out to 3rd party ecosystem crates, and a common complaint from new Rust developers is that they don't know where to start: which crates they ought to use and which crates they ought to trust. This list attempts to answer those questions."
