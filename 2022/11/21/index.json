    "Description": "We are currently at the cusp of transitioning from “learning from data” to “learning what data to learn from” as the central focus of AI research. State-of-the-art deep learning models, like GPT‑[X] and Stable Diffusion, have been described as data sponges,1 capable of modeling immense amounts of data.2 These large generative models, many based on the transformer architecture, can model massive datasets, learning to produce images, video, audio, code, and data in many other domains at a quality that begins to rival that of samples authored by human experts. Growing evidence suggests the generality of such large models is largely limited by the quality of the training data. Yet, mainstream training practices are not inherently data-seeking. Instead, they ignore the specific quality of information within the training data in favor of maximizing data quantity. This discrepancy hints at a likely, major shift in research focus in the coming years, toward innovating directly on data collection and generation as a principal way to improve model performance. To our knowledge, the term “data sponge” was first coined in Eric Jang’s excellent article, “Just Ask for Generalization.” https://evjang.com/2021/10/23/generalization.html. ↩ The recent Stable Diffusion model effectively compresses approximately 100GB of training data into a mere 2GB of model weights. ↩"
