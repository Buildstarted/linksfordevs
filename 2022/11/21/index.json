    "Description": "Software engineers can make code do just about anything. However, they often struggle with career direction, work-life balance and finding true meaning in their jobs.\n\nAm I hitting a bit close to home? \n\nLet’s change that.\n\nI have 16 years of experience at a high-performance, high-stress FAANG company as a principal engineer (top 1%). I’ve conducted over 850 technical interviews and am an expert on the promotion/growth track for high-level, non-managerial tech leadership.\n\nIt’s time to learn how to give your career and your life the same impact that your programs create for others. I’ll be there to guide you, prod you and maybe even push you out of your comfort zone. \n\nReady to take a smart engineering approach to your career and life? \n\nLet’s do this."
