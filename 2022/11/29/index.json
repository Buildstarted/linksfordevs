    "Description": "Messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp offer a contact\n  discovery service that allow you to discover which of the\n  contacts in your address book are also a member. Depending on the\n  implementation, this creates certain privacy risks. Even though Signal uses a\n  protocol involving a trusted execution environment to mitigate the\n  risk, an inherent risk of (one-sided) contact discovery remains: if\n  someone (a patient, an ex) has your phone number in their address\n  book, they will be notified when you join Signal. Not necessarily what\n  you expect when joining a messaging service that focuses on privacy.\n  This motivated me to study mutual contact discovery, where\n  users of a messaging app can only discover each other when\n  both have each other’s phone number in their address\n  book."
