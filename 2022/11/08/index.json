The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.If you already have an app targeting and earlier preview of .NET 7.0 on the platform, there is no need to take action as the new runtime will be picked up on the next application restart once the update is available for your app. You can trigger this manually by starting and stopping your app.Self-contained .NET apps will not be auto-updated since they have no dependency on the runtime provided by App Service.Azure Functions and Azure Static Webapps are also enabling .NET 7 workloads across their scenarios.If you want to learn more, be sure to checkout our session during .NET Conf 2022:  Tuesday 11/09 @ 11:00am PST Join Scott Hunter to talk about the latest happening in the world of building cloud native applications with .NET and Azure  Thursday 11/10 @ 1:00am PST Join @bktv99 and @segaurav will be taking the stage talk about  “.NET 7.0 and bulk migration of ASP.Net web apps to App Services”.Next steps:  Download .NET 7  Anouncing .NET 7.0   ASP.NET Core in .NET 7  Deploy a .NET application to App ServiceYou can also follow us on twitter for more updates and news: @AzAppService"

    "Description": "The start of both architectures is the same: the domain. The ports and adapters architecture is often referred to as an onion structure. The reason for this is that when the application is growing you’ll see a set of layers being added on top of each other, like onion peel. The domain is always the core, the layers on top of that depend on your application. The outside layer is the outside world: this could be writing to the database, receiving an API request, or reading a file on disk – anything that is not under your control should be considered the ‘outside world’ or ‘untrusted’. You’ll notice the core of your union, the place within your control, is fairly small. In functional programming, this domain is usually pure. This is a big difference from the object-oriented approach where you inject ‘impure’ or ‘untrusted’ services within core functionality. The data direction is a lot simpler and descriptive in a port and adapter architecture. The direction and relation between the layers are made explicit while in a dependency injection system. This relation is often scattered."
