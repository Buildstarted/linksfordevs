I \nstill use iTextSharp in a large MVC 5 application that I'm in the process of\n\nmigrating to ASP.NET Core. The version I use is very old (4.1.6), and the \nAPI is very low level so it takes quite a while to write the code required to generate \neven a moderately complex PDF. Ideally I need a replacement for the new \napplication that can generate PDF files purely from HTML, which is an API I'm \nmuch more comfortable with. This ancient version of iTextSharp doesn't support \nHTML as a source of content. In this article, I consider some alternatives."
