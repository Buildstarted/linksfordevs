The general approach is to block all inbound access to all ports except the ones that your webserver and sshd are running on. This approach can get you quite far, but you’re still going to have lots of requests from bad actors trying to find a way in. Tools exist to help you by monitoring auth logs and applying filters, but they’re reactive, and have limited utility as a preventative measure."

The version I use is very old (4.1.6), and the \nAPI is very low level so it takes quite a while to write the code required to generate \neven a moderately complex PDF. Ideally I need a replacement for the new \napplication that can generate PDF files purely from HTML, which is an API I'm \nmuch more comfortable with.
