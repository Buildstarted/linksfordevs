    "Description": "JavaScript decorators have finally reached stage 3! Their latest version is already supported by Babel and will soon be supported by TypeScript. This blog post covers the 2022-03 version (stage 3) of the ECMAScript proposal “Decorators” by Daniel Ehrenberg and Chris Garrett. In principle, decorators are a JavaScript feature for library authors: They let them define @-prefixed keywords that can be put in front of classes and various class members (such as methods) and change how these constructs work – for example: @freeze class C {} The decorator @freeze changes class C so that all of its instances are frozen. We’ll implement this decorator later. Users of libraries profit indirectly from decorators because they get features that are based on them. Decorators are mostly an object-oriented feature and popular in OOP frameworks and libraries such as Ember, Angular, Vue, web component frameworks and MobX. In this blog post, we learn how decorators work and use our knowledge to implement several of them."
