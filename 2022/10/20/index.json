    "Description": "Станом на 6 жовтня до Росії примусово депортовано понад 1,6 мільйона українців. Про це повідомив президент Володимир Зеленський під час виступу перед Генеральною асамблеєю Організації американських держав (ОАД). Нещодавно російська окупаційна адміністрація в Херсоні оголосила про так звану \"евакуацію\" мешканців регіону до РФ та окупованого Росією Криму, що насправді є нічим іншим, як продовженням тієї ж політики примусових депортацій та незаконного позбавлення волі, які раніше були застосовані російськими окупантами в Криму та на сході України.\n____________________________________\nMore than 1.6 million Ukrainians were forcibly deported to Russia. It was reported by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a speech at the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). Recently, the Russian occupation administration in Kherson announced the so-called \"evacuation\" of the residents of the region to the Russian Federation and Russian-occupied Crimea, which in fact is nothing more than a continuation of the same policy of forced deportations and illegal deprivation of liberty, which was previously applied by the Russian occupiers in Crimea and on in the east of Ukraine.\n_________\nПідписуйтесь на @bykvu\n\n#новини #новиниукраїни #війна #росіяагресор #україна #StayWithUkraine #Ukraine #StayTogether #StandTogether #StopRussia #StopWar"

    "Domain": "yt.artemislena.eu",
    "Description": "EF Core 7.0 introduces the ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete APIs, which allow you to easily use LINQ to express a database update or delete operation. These APIs can be far more efficient for applying changes to multiple rows based on a condition, e.g. “delete rows which have InActive set to true” (AKA bulk update scenarios). But in some scenarios, they also allow you to express changes over a single row in a much more succinct and simple way, simplifying your code. ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete completely bypass EF’s change tracking and execute immediately, as opposed to when SaveChanges is called. Tune in to learn more and to explore the new possibilities that these new APIs bring!\n\nFeaturing: Arthur Vickers (@ajcvickers), Shay Rojansky (@shayrojansky)"

    "Description": "JavaScript decorators have finally reached stage 3! Their latest version is already supported by Babel and will soon be supported by TypeScript. This blog post covers the 2022-03 version (stage 3) of the ECMAScript proposal “Decorators” by Daniel Ehrenberg and Chris Garrett. In principle, decorators are a JavaScript feature for library authors: They let them define @-prefixed keywords that can be put in front of classes and various class members (such as methods) and change how these constructs work – for example: @freeze class C {} The decorator @freeze changes class C so that all of its instances are frozen. We’ll implement this decorator later. Users of libraries profit indirectly from decorators because they get features that are based on them. Decorators are mostly an object-oriented feature and popular in OOP frameworks and libraries such as Ember, Angular, Vue, web component frameworks and MobX. In this blog post, we learn how decorators work and use our knowledge to implement several of them."
