[8:35] With minimal APIs, is it different capabilities, or have they mapped all of the capabilities of web API down into those extension methods that you can use? [10:25] What is the difference between authorization and authentication? [17:25] What’s Rob’s preferred mechanism for internal private web services? [21:30] Where Raspberry APIs really shine. [22:08] Rob tells us about a very cool talk he has coming up. [27:03] DevContainers is such a magical thing. [28:02] Rob is digging deep into GitHub actions, and he is starting to build out custom GitHub action tasks for interesting things. &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:  — New video podcast!
