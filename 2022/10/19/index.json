Note: I joined the Mail team in June 2000, three months before the Public Beta. We shipped the first “real” version of Mac OS X (10.0) nine months later. On March 24, 2001, Apple released Mac OS X 10.0 (internally codenamed Cheetah). The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve.

The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work."
