    "Description": "Pull Rust introductory support from Kees Cook:\n \"The tree has a recent base, but has fundamentally been in linux-next\n  for a year and a half[1]. It's been updated based on feedback from the\n  Kernel Maintainer's Summit, and to gain recent Reviewed-by: tags.\n\n  Miguel is the primary maintainer, with me helping where needed/wanted.\n  Our plan is for the tree to switch to the standard non-rebasing\n  practice once this initial infrastructure series lands.\n\n  The contents are the absolute minimum to get Rust code building in the\n  kernel, with many more interfaces[2] (and drivers - NVMe[3], 9p[4], M1\n  GPU[5]) on the way.\n\n  The initial support of Rust-for-Linux comes in roughly 4 areas:\n\n   - Kernel internals (kallsyms expansion for Rust symbols, %pA format)\n\n   - Kbuild infrastructure (Rust build rules and support scripts)\n\n   - Rust crates and bindings for initial minimum viable build\n\n   - Rust kernel documentation and samples\n\n  Rust support has been in linux-next for a year and a half now, and the\n  short log doesn't do justice to the number of people who have\n  contributed both to the Linux kernel side but also to the upstream\n  Rust side to support the kernel's needs.
