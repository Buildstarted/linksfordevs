    "Description": "The Doom Wiki began in January 2005 as part of Wikia, Inc. (then called Wikicities, now rebranded as \"FANDOM\").  Although Wikia is a for-profit company, its staff seemed friendly, industrious, and hobbyist-oriented. [1] [2]  Over the years, however, an increasing focus on advertising and social networking made the site difficult to use as a knowledge base.  Disjointed article layouts, garish color schemes, and ungainly \"wysiwyg\" editing interfaces would be proposed, then suddenly become mandatory.  Reaction to these changes was typically brushed off or answered with PR boilerplate. [3] [4] [5]"
