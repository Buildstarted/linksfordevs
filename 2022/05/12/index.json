    "Timestamp": "2022-05-12T23:02:09",
    "Domain": "nanxiao.me",
    "Description": "I graduated from school in 2008, and my first job is an embedded software engineer. After working for more than 2 years, I joined in another traditional telecommunication company (let me use A to stand for it). Fast forward to 2014, the business of A company seemed stagnated for a while: more and more people began to use OTT applications from the second decade of 21th century, and it was a big hurt to telecommunication companies like A. Though I still had salary increase every year, the amount can be ignored. But the good thing is A company has good work-life-balance culture. Besides that, my daily work is: a) Add new trivial features for one system which is written in C and run on Solaris 10. b) Answer technical questions which support engineers don't know about. Since I had been very familiar with the stuff I was in charge of, I knew I could not absorb new knowledge from A company, so I did following things to improve myself in 2014: (1) Read English technical articles. Yes, before 2014, I had mostly used Chinese key words to search related technical posts and read them. After switching to English, I am exposed to another world which has plentiful resource for me to explore. (2) Write English blog. I realised that if I just write Chinese articles, only the people who know Chinese can understand them. But if I record my thoughts in English, the people around the world can read them. Believe it or not, my current employer even referred one of my blog post before I became its employee. (3) Learn git. A company still used svn in 2014, and it was enough for our development procedure. But I knew git is the trend. I still remember I read Pro git and practised the commands from the book in a server; Pro git is the best tutorial of git until now. (4) Study Go. Go became popular in 2014, and the market for C developer began to shrink. The reason for me to learn Go is simple: hope to secure my future career. I even spent lot of time in trying to run Go on Solaris, but no success. The irony is until this year (2022), I am still a full-time C developer and never got a Go job. On top of the above things, I also did others: wrote some DTrace tutorials in Chinese, joined some IRC chat rooms to learn English, etc. All in all, I learnt a lot of new things in 2014. Not every software engineer can work in leading companies which have advanced technologies and did cool things, but everyone can improve himself/herself by self-learning. Hope my story can give others inspiration."

The same network with the same weights can play Atari, caption images, chat, stack blocks with a real robot arm and much more, deciding based on its context whether to output text, joint torques, button presses, or other tokens. In this report we describe the model and the data, and document the current capabilities of Gato."
