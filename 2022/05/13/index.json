    "Description": "Secrets can grant access to data, impact production operations, access third party systems down the software supply chain, and introduce a reputational risk. They can be found in source code, production and CI/CD logs, Docker images, Slack channels, or even on a random shared file. Given how powerful secrets are, it is critical that developer security tools provide secret detection for free across public and private repos."
