    "Description": "One of the fun examples among all the copyright fuss is the  extreme  example\nof  copyright claims made by AT&T some time in the 1980s.  It's the /bin/true\nprogram.  This is a \"dummy\" library program whose main function is to make it\neasy  to  write  infinite  loops  (while true do ...) in shells scripts.  The\n\"true\" program does nothing; it merely exits with a zero exit  status.   This\ncan  be  done with an empty file that's marked executable, and that's what it\nwas in the earliest unix system  libraries.   Such  an  empty  file  will  be\ninterpreted  as  a  shell  script  that  does nothing, and since it does this\nsuccessfully, the shell exits with a zero exit status.   But  AT&T's  lawyers\ndecided that this was worthy of copyright protection."
