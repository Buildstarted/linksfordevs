How many features can we build? How many bugs can we fix in this release? How many interviews should I do? And so on.Later in career PM tend to think in outcomes. What features will bring the most impact this year? What bugs will solve most of our user’s issues? What type of interviews will bring answers our teams need? This is what I can best define as a “Pareto PM”. For those unfamiliar, the pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule simply states that 80% of the outcomes come from 20% of the causes."

Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to\nreplicate without significant capital. For the few that are available through\nAPIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difficult to\nstudy. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only\npre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to\nfully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B\nis comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to\ndevelop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure\nchallenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released\nmodels."
