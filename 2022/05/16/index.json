    "Description": "Operator precedence is a traditional feature of mathematical notation where,\nabsent explicit parentheses, some operators bind tighter than others (\"have\nhigher precedence\"). For example, a + b × c would be interpreted as\na + (b × c), not as (a + b) × c, because multiplication has\nhigher precedence than addition."
