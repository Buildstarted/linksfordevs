You write the code in some language and then it spits out bitcode that a small crystall inside your computer understands.\nSome databases ship with a specialized compiler inside them. This compiler can generate assembly code for parts of the query that are executed often. Such technique is called JIT compilation and can greatly reduce the interpretation overhead during query execution."
