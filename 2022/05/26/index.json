    "Description": "A lot of new tools that devs use seem to be written in Go. But why not C#? I know that C# and .Net is more than capable. Is it a lack of that kind of culture? How can we foster a more open source culture because it still seems like a lot of devs have old prejudices towards C# and .Net. I think having more interesting and useful open source tools written in C# would go a long way to change perceptions."
