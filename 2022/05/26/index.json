Focus builds on the Vertigo Engine, which demonstrates the power and versatility of our platform.\nThe core video CODEC works in combination with multiple neural networks that perform head and face tracking and real-time face recognition, to either filter away unrelated bystanders, or to allow everyone in view of the camera to be present in the call on equal footing."
