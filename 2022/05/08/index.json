In this post we will discuss how a .NET 6.0 Azure function can be deployed to Azure with the help of GitHub Actions - which will help you to implement continuous delivery / deployment for Azure Functions. First we need to create an Azure Function - I am doing it in the Portal. I am creating a .NET Function."

    "Description": "Rust is an appealing language for building user interfaces for a variety of reasons, especially the promise of delivering both performance and safety. However, finding a good architecture is challenging. Architectures that work well in other languages generally don’t adapt well to Rust, mostly because they rely on shared mutable state and that is not idiomatic Rust, to put it mildly. It is sometimes asserted for this reason that Rust is a poor fit for UI. I have long believed that it is possible to find an architecture for UI well suited to implementation in Rust, but my previous attempts (including the current Druid architecture) have all been flawed. I have studied a range of other Rust UI projects and don’t feel that any of those have suitable architecture either."

    "Description": "In this series we explore the wonderful world of the bounding volume hierarchy: the mysterious data structure that enables real-time ray tracing on recent GPUs, in complex, animated scenes. Despite the broad adoption of ray tracing in games, in-depth understanding of the underlying technology seems to be reserved to a select few. In this article we show how a proper BVH is implemented without support from DXR / RTX / OptiX / Vulkan, in easy-to-read ‘sane C++’. Whether this is actually useful for you, or just interesting as background information, depends on your needs, obviously."

I’m an “adult improver”, as we’re known in the chess world. I may get very good, but I will never be a grandmaster, or even an international master. The only chance I had to be a grandmaster died at around the age of 10, and maybe my chances of being an IM died a few years after that."
