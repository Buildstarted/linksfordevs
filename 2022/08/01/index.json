    "Description": "Type inheritance hierarchies as used in object-oriented programming do not map naturally to relational database schemas. In this live stream, we will look at different strategies for inheritance mapping when using EF Core with a relational database. This includes table-per-hierarchy (TPH) mapping, table-per-type (TPT) mapping, and table-per-concrete type (TPC) mapping, which is new in EF Core 7.0 preview 5. We will look at the consequences of the mapping on the generated SQL and consider the performance and storage implications. This will result in some guidance as to when each strategy should be used.\n\nCommunity Links: https://www.theurlist.com/dotnet-data-2022-06-15\n\nFeaturing: Arthur Vickers (@ajcvickers)\n\nGet your questions answered on the Microsoft Q&A for .NET - https://aka.ms/dotnetqa\n​\nLearn .NET with free self-guided learning from Microsoft Learn: http://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#entityframework #efcore #orm"

OpenTelemetry (or OTel) standardises metrics, logs, and traces - allowing different systems and languages to be able to write telemetry data in a common format and be understood by any visualisation UIs that support it. This is becoming widely adopted, meaning that with minor changes to your applications - you can ship off telemetry to various combinations of providers, giving you much more choice and flexibility."
