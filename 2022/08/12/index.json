    "Description": "Running a Linux VM from my MacBook Pro is how I spend much of my time during software development. In this post, I compare multiple solutions to this problem, with a focus on how they perform with I/O operations.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Background\n\n\n\n On my MacBook Pro, my preferred setup for software development is to use Mac-native development tools like Sublime Text 3 or VSCode paired with a Linux VM running in the background.\n\n\n\n Modern virtual machines have near-native performance on CPU and Memory. However, shared folders between the host and VM continue to be a major bottleneck. There are many ways that different providers attempt to solve the problem of shared folders, and this is what my benchmarks were focused on. Below, I call the different approaches to shared folders “filesystem adapters”.\n\n\n\n Methodology\n\n\n\n All tests were run on a mid-2015 MacBook Pro with a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 running macOS 10.14.6.\n\n\n\nEnvironments\n\n\n\n The following environments were tested:\n\n\n\n Multipass: Solution from Canonical, the makers of Ubuntu, to spin up quick Ubuntu Server instances. On macOS, it uses HyperKit for its virtualization environment and SSHFS for its file system adapter.\n\n\n\n$ multipass --version\nmultipass  1.6.2+mac\n\n\n\n\n Docker Desktop for Mac, gRPC FUSE: Like Multipass, Docker Desktop for Mac also sits on top of HyperKit. However, it uses a custom filesystem adapter called gRPC FUSE. Extensive discussion about the pros and cons of this adapter can be found in this GitHub thread.\n\n\n\n$ docker --version\nDocker version 20.10.6, build 370c289\n\n\n\n\n Docker Desktop for Mac, osxfs: This is an older filesystem for Docker Desktop for Mac, which is intended to be replaced by gRPC FUSE.\n\n\n\n Vagrant: Vagrant is not itself a virtualization environment; it must sit on top of one. However, Vagrant ships its own filesystem adapter based on NFS, which makes it interesting to benchmark.\n\n\n\n Note that the Vagrant version used in testing is a bit old, and it sits on top of VMware 8.\n\n\n\n$ vagrant --version\nVagrant 2.1.1\n\n\n\n\n VMware Fusion: One of the two main commercial virtual machine environments for macOS hosts. VMware Fusion uses HGFS as its filesystem adapter.\n\n\n\n VMware Fusion versions 8.5.10 and 11.5.7 were both tested.\n\n\n\n Parallels Desktop 16: The other of the two main commercial virtual machine environments for macOS hosts. Parallels Desktop mounts shared directories under /media/psf.\n\n\n\n Parallels Desktop was tested under both the Apple Hypervisor and the Parallels Hypervisor, yielding similar results. The data shown in the following section uses the Parallels Hypervisor.\n\n\n\nBenchmarks\n\n\n\n The following benchmarks were run. All commands were run within a filesystem shared with the host as described above.\n\n\n\n fio –ioengine=libaio:\n\n\n\n This is a standard way to measure I/O performance. Source: GitLab Docs\n\n\n\n$ fio --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --readwrite=randrw --rwmixread=75 --size=512M --filename=fio_test\n\n\n\n\n fio –ioengine=sync:\n\n\n\n This variant of the above command was tested as well, because --direct=1 is not supported in all of the filesystem adapters being tested.\n\n\n\n$ fio --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=sync --direct=0 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --readwrite=randrw --rwmixread=75 --size=128M --filename=fio_test\n\n\n\n\n Create and read 1000 files:\n\n\n\n This is a quick and dirty test of filesystem performance using Bash. Source: GitLab Docs\n\n\n\n$ mkdir test; cd test\n$ time for i in {0..1000}; do echo 'test' > "
