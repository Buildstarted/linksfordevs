    "Description": "We often take the .NET Runtime for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!\n\nIn this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering 'Value Types', 'Tiered Compilation', 'Stubs' and more.\n\nAfterwards, you'll never take a simple 'method call' for granted again!!\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndclondon.com/"
