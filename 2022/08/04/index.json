It “defines an HTTP extension header field that allows proxy components to disclose information lost in the proxying process, for example, the originating IP address(…)”. However there is not any mechanism to protect subsequent component against spoofing. Indeed, if your subsequent component, let’s say an API, is exposed on Internet, anyone can forge a HTTP Forwarded header. If your API is always behind your proxy, it has to remove/replace the original Forwarded header. It becomes even more complex if you have multiple proxies."

    "Description": "While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text and image\ndatasets, its superiority on tabular data is not clear. We contribute extensive\nbenchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based\nmodels such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets\nand hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from\nvaried domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking\nmethodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good\nhyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on\nmedium-sized data ($\\sim$10K samples) even without accounting for their\nsuperior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation\ninto the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and Neural Networks\n(NNs). This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers\naiming to build tabular-specific NNs: 1. be robust to uninformative features,\n2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn\nirregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we\ncontribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20\n000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner."

This includes table-per-hierarchy (TPH) mapping, table-per-type (TPT) mapping, and table-per-concrete type (TPC) mapping, which is new in EF Core 7.0 preview 5. We will look at the consequences of the mapping on the generated SQL and consider the performance and storage implications. This will result in some guidance as to when each strategy should be used.\n\nCommunity Links: https://www.theurlist.com/dotnet-data-2022-06-15\n\nFeaturing: Arthur Vickers (@ajcvickers)\n\nGet your questions answered on the Microsoft Q&A for .NET - https://aka.ms/dotnetqa\n​\nLearn .NET with free self-guided learning from Microsoft Learn: http://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#entityframework #efcore #orm"

    "Description": "We often take the .NET Runtime for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible!\n\nIn this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR), from a performance perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering 'Value Types', 'Tiered Compilation', 'Stubs' and more.\n\nAfterwards, you'll never take a simple 'method call' for granted again!!\n\n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://www.ndcconferences.com\nhttps://ndclondon.com/"
