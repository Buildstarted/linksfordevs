Now, here, in 2022, desktop computers no longer exist and all computing is done via handheld mobile telephone. Time to update this dinosaur.\nThese thousands of words and megabytes of images will cover some bits of porting the game from big desktop to little phone. As a winking throwback to days past, this is a big dump of text and inline img tags instead of exciting splashes of quick-cut video."

    "Description": "The problem I want to play Minecraft with my friends, and I already have a server exposed to the internet. However, my server is severely underpowered and is unable to run a Minecraft server instance. On the other hand, I have a spare beefy laptop that can easily handle the load, but port-forwarding is not possible. Both the server and the laptop are on my Tailscale network. Could I somehow leverage all of this to spin up a Minecraft server with a public IP? The answer was yes—and I was surprised at how easy it all was. As a plus, the server is very playable and the latency was better than trying out random “free hosting” services."

When I first stumbled across this it wasn’t one of the bugs that just scream in your face - it was subtle. Something didn’t add up, and after a lot of digging it became clear that things didn’t add up around the year mark - repeatedly, but weirdly enough sometimes affecting a few days in December, and in other cases affecting a few days in January."
