However, my server is severely underpowered and is unable to run a Minecraft server instance. On the other hand, I have a spare beefy laptop that can easily handle the load, but port-forwarding is not possible. Both the server and the laptop are on my Tailscale network. Could I somehow leverage all of this to spin up a Minecraft server with a public IP? The answer was yes‚Äîand I was surprised at how easy it all was. As a plus, the server is very playable and the latency was better than trying out random ‚Äúfree hosting‚Äù services."

When I first stumbled across this it wasn‚Äôt one of the bugs that just scream in your face - it was subtle. Something didn‚Äôt add up, and after a lot of digging it became clear that things didn‚Äôt add up around the year mark - repeatedly, but weirdly enough sometimes affecting a few days in December, and in other cases affecting a few days in January."
