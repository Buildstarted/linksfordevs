There’s not a whole lot of reasons to use it over something else if you’ve got a native option available, but if you don’t it’s pretty great. I got interested because it was the first emulator to support the TI84+CSE when that calculator was released in the early 2010s. The CSE was exciting because it retrofitted a 320x240 color display onto the hardware platform of the 84+SE, so all the other hardware and OS access was the same except for graphics. I wanted to be one of the first game developers for the CSE, but developing for the calculator without an emulator and debugger is pretty painful, so I tried out jsTIfied with my older calculator ROMs to get a feel for it."
