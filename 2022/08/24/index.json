If those words make no sense to you: HTTP public key pinning was a now-mostly-defunct mechanism whereby websites could “pin” themselves to a set of public keys, so that browsers would not accept a certificate for that website’s hostname unless one of those pinned public keys appeared in its certificate chain. Certificate Transparency is a system whereby certificates must be logged in public append-only logs, so that domain owners can observe them as they are issued and detect malicious certificates (see my previous overview here)."

    "Description": "I want to make a prediction. I think in around 10 - 15 years, most of the people in the western World will own or think about owning a Virtual Reality Headset. I also think that digital Assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa will be more important in that context than currently.\nFor context: I own a VR Headset and use digital Assistants since multiple years. I also worked in a team developing a digital Assistant and seeing practical use-cases for AR in the past."
