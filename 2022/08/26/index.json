    "Description": "Like I wrote in my last article, as a developer sometimes you get stuck on a problem for a few hours or a few days, your code won't work, and you think nobody can help you 😿. This can be very frustrating, but fortunately, there are plenty of ways to look for a solution or to seek help. You are probably already using some of them with success, yet there may be some you don't think of and that could help you a lot. That is the topic of this article."
