This introduces numerous vulnerabilities that have been exploited to violate the security of our computing platforms. Mechanisms to mitigate these hazards, such as Memory Management Units (MMUs), increase the complexity and power-consumption of CPUs. The movement to multicore processors amplifies the problem and adds more complexity to synchronize shared-memory access across cores (e.g.: cache coherency logic)."

Every weekend, she would smoke at parties, and every Monday, she would quit smoking once again.\nFor me, quitting Twitter was more like Hemmingway’s going broke: slowly then all at once.\nSlowly, I created a professional account, moved the alt account using my teenage AIM screen name to private, and juggled which devices (laptop, phone, tablet) were able to access which accounts under which screen names at which times with what screen time limits. And then all at once I stopped reading any of my Tweeter feeds, thanks pretty much entirely due to reading the first two chapters of The This by Adam Roberts."
