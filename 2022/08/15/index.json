The first one is part of SYSV generic ABI and is\nwell documented and marked as mandatory. DT_GNU_HASH is a newer, smaller, and\nfaster replacement that is not documented,\nimplemented in a few places (Glibc, GNU ld, Musl, LLVM, mold, etc.) and a\nsubject of a couple of blog posts that I’ve\nfound. Turns out it also doesn’t provide the same\nfunctionality as DT_HASH. To get the number of symbols you have to completely\nparse it."
