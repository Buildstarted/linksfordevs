    "Description": "Pagination is a technique to load only smaller chunks of data you make visible to the user. Look at Google web search. You only have a certain amount of shown results even though there are millions. So Google has pages (like in a book) where you can go forth and back.\nThis has multiple advantages: First from a UX point of view you only show a reasonable amount of data to your user. The second benefit is for your API / DB as it only has to load a small page instead of the whole book.\n"

One of the things that always catches my eyes is the idea of discoverability, or how a user is able to discover that action X does some thing Y.\nA basic way to do so is to rely on patterns that we’re all familiar with."
