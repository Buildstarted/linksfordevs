Since in one of my project I was also loading videos from azure blob, I thought I will explore it a little bit. In the project I am displaying the video in <video> tag. So without downloading the full video files, users won’t be able to play it. And even if users are not playing the video, it will always download the full video. Here is the network tab - with 6 video files with 25 MB."
