So recently, I spent some time refreshing and deepening my knowledge of PostgreSQL to improve my skills and experience in using it (writing and optimizing queries, creating new objects, etc.). And I found many awesome features and syntax sugar constructions that can tremendously ease your daily routine and eliminate problems that may appear while resolving sophisticated tasks. In this article, I will try to review 6 PostgreSql traits that seem to me the most important and easy-usable in a clear and brief way."
