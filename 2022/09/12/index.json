    "Description": "What’s the shortest URL for which content is served on the internet? There are quite a few single-letter second-level domains that are used in very short URLs, such as Google’s http://g.co or Facebook’s https://m.me.\nBut we can go shorter than this: there’s nothing stopping TLD registry operators serving A records at the apexes of their TLD zones. For example, if Verisign (the operator of the com TLD registry) wished, they could add an A record at the apex of the com TLD zone – com would then resolve to that IP, and your browser would connect to that IP when you visited https://com."
