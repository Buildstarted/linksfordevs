    "Description": "Cloud compute is usually seen as an ethereal resource. You launch VMs and spin them down, billed to the second. The billing and the mental model make it seem like these resources are limitless. That's typically one of the selling points versus on-prem compute. They can scale responsively to your load so you're not paying for excess compute that you don't need but it's there when you want it."
