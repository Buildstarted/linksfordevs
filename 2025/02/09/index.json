    "Description": "Giving a name to an amorphous new thing is a powerful act. And that’s what Karpathy did, via tweet:\n\nThere’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard. I ask for the dumbest things like “decrease the padding on the sidebar by half” because I’m too lazy to find it. I “Accept All” always, I don’t read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I’d have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can’t fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away. It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I’m building a project or webapp, but it’s not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."

    "Description": "In June 2017, Vaswani et al. published the paper “Attention Is All You Need” describing the “Transformer” architecture, which is a purely attention based sequence to sequence model. It can be applied to many tasks, such as language translation and text summarization. Since its publication, the paper has been cited more than one thousand times and several excellent blog posts were written on the topic; I recommend this one.\nVaswani et al. use positional encoding, to inject information about a token’s position within a sentence into the model. The exact definition is written down in section 3.5 of the paper (it is only a tiny aspect of the Transformer, as the red circle in the cover picture of this post indicates). After the definition, the authors state:\n“We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset $k$, $PE_{pos+k}$ can be represented as a linear function of $PE_{pos}$.”\nBut why is that? In this post I prove this linear relationship between relative positions in the Transformer’s positional encoding."

While I actually really enjoy programming, I find writing code for research projects less satisfying and pretty tedious. The latter seems to be a very common sentiment among my peers: we spend a lot more time writing and debugging project boilerplate than actually building experiments! This post (hopefully, of several) begins to share how we can use modern tools in our workflows to both write less code and spend less time debugging."
