But this is the problem: PowerPoint was never meant to be the presentation, it was meant to support one. In large companies, this tool has been twisted into something it was never designed to be, and that’s why I dislike it. A lot!"

    "Description": "As a programmer, it is natural to think of data as a series of one-to-one relationships between string identifiers and objects in a computer.  Many standard libraries in programming languages allow for round-tripping between strings and objects, including JSON, ISO-8601 date strings, and URL encode/decode.  So, if you can create a localized string, such as with .toLocaleString() in ECMA-402, why can’t you parse that string back to an object using a function like .fromLocaleString()?\n\n\n\n The answer comes down to the fact that i18n is fundamentally different from data interchange.  This document lays out why you should not parse localized strings and the best practices for what to do instead.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Parsing Is Not a Science\n\n\n\n What is the number represented by the localized string "

    "Domain": "thomascountz.com",
    "Description": "In A Life-Saving Checklist, author Atul Gawande describes a patient suffering from an infection introduced by medical equipment. These “line infections” are so common, they’re said to be a routine complication. In medical practice, a routine complication refers to an adverse event or difficulty that is known to occur with some regularity in association with a particular procedure or treatment. These complications are expected in the sense that they are well-documented and occur with a known frequency, allowing healthcare providers to anticipate and manage them effectively. In other domains, such as software development, it is useful to identify routine complications inherent to various operations, and understand both their potential for happening and their potential negative impacts. As an example, during incident response, if standard operating procedure (SOP) includes restarting a web server, routine complications to be understood include: accidentally restarting a healthy server (misdiagnosis), executing a restart incorrectly (human error), cutting off further observations of the issue before it’s fully understood (state evaporation), and encountering unexpected dependencies that cause cascading failures (hidden coupling). Just because restarting a web server carries with it these potential issues, doesn’t mean we should shy away from the tried-and-true “turn it off and on again” procedure (every operation carries risk after all). Instead, we should manage routine complications by understanding them honestly, preparing for them openly, and being blameless when they happen."

    "Domain": "evertheylen.eu",
    "Description": "The problem As a developer, you likely run a lot of code you can’t or don’t have time to verify. Many modern projects have lots of dependencies, and none of the package managers I know provide any isolation from the rest of your system. For example, create-react-app will install 1400 dependencies from 285 authors. Do you trust all of them? More importantly, do you trust their security posture?\nEventually, this will go wrong. Many examples exist (PyPI, NPM, AUR). Even though the lack of isolation is the de facto standard, I think this is borderline irresponsible. Especially as a freelance developer working for multiple clients. Therefore, while I can’t fully prevent supply-chain attacks, I can drastically minimize their potential damage.\n"
