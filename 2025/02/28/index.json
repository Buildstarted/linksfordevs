    "Description": "DeepSeek R1 has shown great reasoning capability when it is firstly released. In this blog post, we detail our learnings in using DeepSeek R1 to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, tailored for legal documents.\nWe choose legal documents because legal professionals often face a daunting task: navigating libraries of cases, statutes, and informal legal commentary. Even the best-intentioned research can get bogged down in retrieving the right documents, let alone summarizing them accurately."

I'm a bad friend, and I have accepted that, but he's always asking me about whatever my latest hyperfixation project is. Did I finish it; did I write a post about it; did I release it to the app store. The question is triggering because the answer is almost always \"no\"."

Codespaces is one part cloud IDE, one part VM; the key selling point is that you can go to any Codespaces-enabled repo in your browser, click “New Codespace,” and you’ll be launched into an environment where you can write, test, and commit code, without a lot of setup. This is powered primarily by Visual Studio Code’s devcontainer feature."

Eventually aider sped me up a lot, but I had to learn some new ways of approaching development. It was different from using cursor in that you don’t really see the code until it’s being edited. This doc is a compilation of the notes I took as I worked on a few projects, which I think will be helpful to others using aider for the first time."
