    "Description": "Ah, Zig. I have a love-hate relationship with this one. A ‚Äúnew‚Äù (reading: appeared a couple years ago,\nalready ‚Äî yes, already), language with high ambitions. Zig was made to run at low-level, with a simple design\nto solve many problems C has (macros, allocators, error handling, more powerful types like baked-in tagged\nunions and bitsets, a better build system, no hidden control flow, etc.). The language claims to be the C\nsuccessor, and today, many people claim that Zig is simpler and even safer than most languages out there ‚Äî\neven Rust! ‚Äî allowing to focus more on the technical challenges around your problem space rather\nthan ‚Äî quoting from the Zig mantra ‚Äî your language knowledge. I think I need to put the full mantra\nbecause I will reuse it through this article:"

    "Description": "Remember when dealing with many-to-many relationships in Entity Framework felt like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions? You needed an extra join entity and sometimes a sprinkle of luck to get it all working. EF Core has come to the rescue, making many-to-many relationships as easy as pie (or a fully assembled bookshelf) and giving you improved configurations that put you in the driver's seat."

Today, activism in the US remains critical. Street protests are an essential tool that activists use to raise awareness and push for institutional change. That being said, challenging existing power structures carries an element of risk - exposure can lead to harassment, arrest, or doxxing."
