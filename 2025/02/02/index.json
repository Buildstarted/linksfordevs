That rarely happens with o1 and basically not at all with o3, so that's a big improvement. Also, o3-mini-high basically crushes the \"easy\" problems like expq2, at times getting better results than Herbie. For example, expq2 is the program:"

One\n        major goal of this process was to remove all Javascript\n        [1]. This meant that I could not continue\n        to use MathJax for rendering mathematics, and instead had to\n        devise a way of formatting equations statically. I had the\n        beginnings of an idea to use eqn(1) for this, and published a YouTube\n        video going over a first pass at a script for doing just\n        that. The basic idea was to embed eqn\n        code into the page and use a script to replace that code with\n        a rendered SVG file during site generation."

Another rough approximation comes from the fact that over\nthe last decade, typically only 40-60K students graduated each year with\na CS major from a US university, whereas the total number of software\nengineers is roughly 4 million. Assuming uniform attrition over 30\nyears, and adjusting both for foreign CS degree holders and local\ngraduates who don’t enter the industry, again we see that\nroughly half of incoming software engineers have CS\ndegrees. including yours\ntruly.I learned to code at a young age, well before I\nattended university, where I majored in mathematics and took only a few\ncomputer science courses. On a good day, we the\nuncredentialed feel grateful (even proud!) to be able to work in this\nindustry without formal qualifications. But in our darker hours, we\nwonder: where would I be if I had a CS degree?"
