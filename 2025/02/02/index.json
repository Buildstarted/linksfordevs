    "Description": "As software developers, we always talk about feeling burnt out, having to constantly switch gears, and trying to keep up with all the new tech stuff. We’re always racing against the clock to get projects done, putting out fires, and sitting through never-ending meetings. Eventually, our creative juices just run dry and our drive starts to fade.\nThis is where Codecation comes in — a dedicated time away from from the usual grind to really dive into coding, learn new stuff, and work on projects that you’re super passionate about, without all the usual distractions from everyday life."

Since I am already using Cloudflare for this website, I figured I'd give this a try. Surprising absolutely no-one, I had to add some slight customizations to my setup."

This meant that I could not continue\n        to use MathJax for rendering mathematics, and instead had to\n        devise a way of formatting equations statically. I had the\n        beginnings of an idea to use eqn(1) for this, and published a YouTube\n        video going over a first pass at a script for doing just\n        that. The basic idea was to embed eqn\n        code into the page and use a script to replace that code with\n        a rendered SVG file during site generation."
