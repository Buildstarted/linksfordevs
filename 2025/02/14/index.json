It does not have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù interpreter, only the JIT compiler. The language is extremely limited, but that was intentional, since I wanted something simple that I could write end-to-end. All the code is written in Rust and it is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/andreabergia/emjay. It‚Äôs roughly 4k lines of code including tests, so it is small enough to be presented in this post."
