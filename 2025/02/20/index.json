    "Description": "Agent mode is here in GitHub Copilot in VS Code and I want to give it a spin to see if it can help me build a full application from scratch. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs new agent mode is capable of iterating on its own code, recognizing errors, and fixing them automatically. It can suggest terminal commands and ask you to execute them.
