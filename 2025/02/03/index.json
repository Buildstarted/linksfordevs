    "Description": "I have maintained the time crate for over five years now. In that time, tens of thousands of lines of code have been added, probably just as many removed, and countless more written but never committed. While benchmarks have been present for quite a while, I had never done one thing: truly optimize. Sure, some algorithms have been changed over the years, but I have never created a nontrivial date-time algorithm from scratch. The speed was good enough, even if it was slower than comparable crates."

Frustrating, right? That’s what debugging EF Core queries feels like without Query Tags. But with Query Tags, it's like a breath of fresh air, relieving the frustration and making the process more manageable. Query Tags in EF Core are like sticky notes for your SQL. They allow you to label your queries, making it significantly easier to track down problems, optimize performance, and appear as a debugging wizard."
