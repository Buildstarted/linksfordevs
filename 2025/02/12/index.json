    "Description": "Grouping data in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) used to feel a little‚Ä¶ clunky. Sometimes, LINQ‚Äôs GroupBy() worked beautifully in-memory but got lost in translation when executing SQL queries. You‚Äôd write a simple GroupBy(), and EF Core would pull all the data into memory before doing the grouping‚Äînot good! But things are getting smarter and more efficient in recent versions of EF Core! With LINQ GroupBy enhancements, EF Core now translates more grouping operations into optimized SQL queries, saving memory and improving performance."
