However, information in one’s bashrc could potentially leak sensitive information — for example:\nssh connection aliases that expose server IPs/hostnames, usernames, and potentially private key locations and ciphers AWS account IDs via aliases and functions, for example when a user aliases authentication with ECR — a basic GitHub search reveals many in the wild A list of installed software on machine, via aliases, completions, functions etc. Absolute paths could reveal the home directory — exposing the user id name Aliases that leak server information, for example kubectl aliases could reference a cluster name, or namespaces, deployments etc. There could be a lot more examples, but you get the idea."
