Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\nGet the source code here: https://www.patreon.com/milanjovanovic\n\nDiscover how to supercharge your MediatR notifications using C# Channels! In this tutorial, I'll show you how to implement a custom NotificationPublisher using System.Threading.Channels to improve performance and scalability in your .NET applications.\n\nI'll walk you through:\n- The limitations of MediatR's default notification system\n- Creating a custom ChannelPublisher implementation\n- How to configure it with just one line of code\n- Performance benchmarks comparing the approaches\n- Important gotchas and considerations before implementing\n\nBut wait! Despite the impressive results, I'll also explain why this might not be the best solution for every project. Learn when to use this pattern and when traditional approaches might actually serve you better.\n\nBuilding a Better MediatR Publisher With Channels (and why you shouldn't)\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/building-a-better-mediatr-publisher-with-channels-and-why-you-shouldnt\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 The Problem Setup\n4:19 ForeachAwaitPublisher\n5:20 TaskWhenAllPublisher\n6:14 ChannelPublisher for async processing\n10:13 Reinventing the wheel?"
