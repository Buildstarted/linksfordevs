    "Description": "While .NET 8's standard resilience handlers provide excellent defaults for HTTP clients, they lack built-in support for overriding these handlers for specific endpoints that require different resilience strategies. This article demonstrates how to implement a custom solution for overriding default handlers and discusses upcoming improvements planned by the .NET team."

The advice made sense\nto me at the time, but it became more concrete to me as I tried to apply it and\nas I noticed when leaders above me failed to do it. I brought it up to my former\nCOO recently, and he put it in a fantastically pithy way by saying “yep, you\nhave to beat the drum.”"
