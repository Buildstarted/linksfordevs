These models have empowered organizations to build their own AI-driven applications, from chatbots and agents to content generation and recommendation systems.\nHowever, while these models are widely accessible, turning them into cost-efficient, production-grade APIs remains a significant challenge. Achieving low-latency, scalable inference requires more than just an optimized model—it demands a holistic system approach that spans multiple layers, from the model itself to the inference engine and the surrounding infrastructure."
