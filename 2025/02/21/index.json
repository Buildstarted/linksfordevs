I definitely believe regardless of the public cloud provider in question, they're all part of a bigger ecosystem. And I emphasize the word ecosystem. I believe security as, you know, a problem statement of our time, it's just so complex that it really can't be solved by a single company or by a single organization or a single individual. You really need to see like collaboration and cooperation taking place across different sectors, across different public cloud providers.\"‚Äî Bojan Magu≈°iƒá\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie \"GaProgMan\" Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Bojan Magu≈°iƒá joined us to talk about both his new book \"Azure Security\" but also his work as part of the security team at Azure and his top tips for protecting your digital landscape (aka your apps and services) on the public cloud.\r\n\r\n Not only did Bojan and I talk about the security aspects of protecting your public cloud digital landscape, but we also talked about how all the public cloud providers actually work together to ensure that everyone is protected from CVEs and exploits when they are discovered. An application of the Infinite Game, if you will‚Äîif you're not sure what that is, we cover that in the episode, too.\r\n\r\n \"So instead of at times you know thinking of it as a zero-sum game, I definitely believe there is opportunity to kind of expand the ecosystem and partner in meaningful ways where we can share information and share insights and guidance and even skill sets that are going to make us all as an industry and, you know, as clients more secure.\"‚Äî Bojan Magu≈°iƒá\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/the-infinite-game-meets-azure-security-with-bojan-magusic/\r\n\r\n Useful Links  Bojan on LinkedIn Azure Security OWASP ZAP‚Äînow owned by Checkmarx  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
