    "Description": "So I was noclipping through d1_canals_08 in HL2 as one normally does on a saturday night when I saw this:\nA nice sharp volumetric light that does a lot for the mood of the scene.\nHalf Life 2 was released in 2004 so obviously it’s not “real” volumetric fog but just a picture of a light beam that rotates towards the camera using Z-Billboard technique. It’s only visible when you look at it from the side. When you look at the light straight on, it fades out to hide the fact that it’s a billboard."
