One that could have allowed me to compromise every Entra ID tenant in the world (except probably those in national cloud deployments). If you are an Entra ID admin reading this, yes that means complete access to your tenant. The vulnerability consisted of two components: undocumented impersonation tokens that Microsoft uses in their backend for service-to-service (S2S) communication, called “Actor tokens”, and a critical vulnerability in the (legacy) Azure AD Graph API that did not properly validate the originating tenant, allowing these tokens to be used for cross-tenant access."
