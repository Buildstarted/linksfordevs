But your homelab isn’t on the internet, so you can’t simply use LetsEncrypt? Well. You can become your own LetsEncrypt and hand out certificates with certbot. You “just” need to run your own CA (Certificate Authority). Sounds frightening and complicated? It kinda is, but not really when you use step-ca, an open source solution that you can run in a container."
