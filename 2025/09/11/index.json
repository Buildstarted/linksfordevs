    "Description": "The tool does not make the artist.\nAn artist can create art with either simple or complex tools. Their skill doesn’t depend on the complexity of the tool, but on their ability, creativity, and above all, on their understanding of the principles of art. A pencil in the hands of an expert produces masterpieces; in the hands of a novice, just doodles.\nHowever, simple tools have one advantage: they make learning easier. Mastering a simple tool is quick, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: learning and practicing the principles."

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most powerful tools in the data scientist’s toolkit for reducing dimensionality while preserving the essence of the data. By identifying directions—called principal components—along which the data varies the most, PCA allows us to simplify complex datasets, visualize patterns, and even improve the performance of machine learning models."

    "Description": "Reproducibility is a bedrock of scientific progress. However, it’s remarkably difficult to get reproducible results out of large language models.\nFor example, you might observe that asking ChatGPT the same question multiple times provides different results. This by itself is not surprising, since getting a result from a language model involves “sampling”, a process that converts the language model’s output into a probability distribution and probabilistically selects a token.\nWhat might be more surprising is that even when we adjust the temperature down to 0This means that the LLM always chooses the highest probability token, which is called greedy sampling. (thus making the sampling theoretically deterministic), LLM APIs are still not deterministic in practice (see past discussions here, here, or here). Even when running inference on your own hardware with an OSS inference library like vLLM or SGLang, sampling still isn’t deterministic (see here or here)."
