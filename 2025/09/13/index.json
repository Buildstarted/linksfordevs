This allows me to focus more on what I’m delivering rather than where, with any changes to common pieces benefitting all downstream machines. By worrying less about each machine being a unicorn, I have more mental bandwidth for the functional parts of the system, which is where I’d rather spend my time. And, running the same software on every machine possible maximizes the testing of it, contributing to higher-quality software."
