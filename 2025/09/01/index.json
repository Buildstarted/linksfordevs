    "Description": "When training large scale LLMs, there is a large assortment of parallelization strategies which you can employ to scale your training runs to work on more GPUs.  There are already a number of good resources for understanding how to parallelize your models: I particularly recommend How To Scale Your Model and The Ultra-Scale Playbook.  The purpose of this blog post is to discuss parallelization strategies in a more schematic way by focusing only on how they affect your device mesh.  The device mesh is an abstraction used by both PyTorch and JAX that takes your GPUs (however many of them you've got in your cluster!) and organizes them into a N-D tensor that expresses how the devices communicate with each other.  When we parallelize computation, we shard a tensor along one dimension of the mesh, and then do collectives along that dimension when there are nontrivial dependencies between shards.  Being able to explain why a device mesh is set up the way it is for a collection of parallelization strategies is a good check for seeing if you understand how the parallelization strategies work in the first place!
