    "Description": "I keep reading this thing, repeated as if it's fact: \"The Open Web is Dead\". At first I agreed, maybe because I also felt bummed out by what's happening, but I have since come 180° on this viewpoint. The Open Web cannot die. As long as there is one person believing in it, it will be there. It's not a thing that you can \"turn it off\", \"fence it in\", \"exclude it\", or whatever else you want to say. The Open Web is what you, as the user, do with it. It will only die if we stop believing."

    "Description": "Last week, I spent some time with Haley (one year old) doing serious research into ‘putting things into other things’.\nWe’d brought her a soft toy squirrel and, inevitably, she had found the cardboard box it came in much more interesting. There followed a considerable period of putting various objects into the box and taking them out again. This was pretty interesting, but the discovery that closing the box made the items disappear was even more fascinating."

This approach will further dilute the idea of a librarian who organizes books in main categories and sub-folder and focuses only on the thought at hand as an individual note. Instead of spending lots of your brainpower on which folder to put a specific note in, you start creating it in one folder for all and linking them together. Usually, you wouldn’t have any structure in these concepts, but I combined the two methods into my Second Brain. You also see in the above design under 💡 Resources/🗃 Zettelkasten I have its folder."

    "Description": "Back in the day, I was on my school’s debate team.\n\nIt was basically a sport for nerds. (In hindsight, my friend group did a lot of “sports for nerds” activities: chess, quiz bowl, competitive gaming, etc.)\n\nAnyway, back to the debate team. We treated it like a sport. We trained for it and attended competitions. It was a lot of fun – but deep down, we were there to win.\n\nA stronger, better-researched, more clearly articulated argument was the big key to winning (obvious).\n\nBut there were lots of other ways to score points:\n\n\n  by flustering your opponent with a hard question,\n  catching them off-guard,\n  pointing out something silly they said,\n  and so on.\n\n\nThis is how most people think about debating, whether it’s on social media or between political candidates. It is eristic (about “winning”).\n\nObviously, this is a popular form of entertainment. We enjoy the drama. We like seeing other people (particularly those we disagree with) get “owned” / “dunked on” / “destroyed” / etc.\n\nWhat sucks about this is how shallow it is.\n\nMostly in academic circles, there is a less popular and considerably less entertaining form of debate. It is dialectic (about learning through disagreement).\n\nThe ground-rules are different:\n\n\n  \n    You are charitable. You interpret your opponent’s argument in a strong way, not a weak way.\n  \n  \n    You look for common ground. If you find yourself agreeing on something – however small – you build from there.\n  \n  \n    You put your ego aside. Being wrong is not a bad thing; it means you’re learning something new.\n  \n\n\nIn a narrow, self-serving sense, there’s obviously a lot of value in being persuasive. But in aggregate, it’s a lot more exciting to actually be right vs. simply being perceived that way.\n\nThis post, and particularly its title, was inspired by this excellent essay by Paul Graham.\n"
