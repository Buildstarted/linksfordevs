    "Description": "## E: apparently it needs to be said that I am not suggesting you switch to\nLinux on your phone today; just that development needs to accelerate. Please\ndon’t be one of the 34 people that replied to tell me Linux is not ready.\nAndroid has always been a fairly open platform, especially if you were\ndeliberate about getting it that way, but we’ve seen in recent months an\nextremely rapid devolution of the Android ecosystem: 1. The closing of\ndevelopment of an increasing number of components in AOSP.\n[https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-android-aosp-developement-private/] 2.\nSamsung [https://trendslife.in/samsung-one-ui-removed-bootloader-unlock/],\nXiaomi\n[https://droidwin.com/xiaomi-might-no-longer-allow-bootloader-unlocking-on-miui/]\nand OnePlus [https://droidwin.com/now-oneplus-restricts-bootloader-unlocking/]\nhave removed the option of bootloader unlocking on all of their devices. I\nsuspect Google is not far behind. 3. Google implementing Play Integrity API and\nencouraging developers to implement it. Notably the EU’s own identity\nverification wallet requires this, in stark contrast to their own laws and\npolicies, despite the protest of hundreds on Github. 4. And finally, the\nmandatory implementation of developer verification across Android systems. Yes,\nif you’re running a 3rd-party OS like GOS you won’t be directly affected by\nthis, but it will impact 99.9% of devices, and I foresee many open source\ndevelopers just opting out of developing apps for Android entirely as a result.\nWe’ve already seen SyncThing simply discontinue development\n[https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discontinuing-syncthing-android/23002] for this\nreason, citing issues with Google Play Store. They’ve also repeatedly denied\nupdates for NextCloud with no explanation, only restoring it after mass outcry.\nAnd we’ve already seen Google targeting any software intended to circumvent ads,\nlabeling them in the system as “dangerous” and “untrusted”. This will most\ncertainly carry into their new “verification” system. Google once competed with\nApple for customers. But in a world where Google walks away from the biggest\nantitrust trial since 1998 with yet another slap on the wrist, competition is\ndead, and Google is taking notes from Apple about what they can legally get away\nwith. Android as we know it is dead. And/or will be dead very soon. We need an\nopen replacement."

Unfortunately, many people interpret Adam’s post to mean “we must build a better revocation system for the Web PKI, today”. In reality, revocation does not make sense to solve anymore, and people should stop trying to solve it directly, because the actual solution to revocation in the public Web PKI is short-lived certificates."

From time to time I would notice that the program either offers it as an option or requires you to have XDG_... type variable be set in your environment. I never looked too deeply into it, however I understood that it provided base paths for the locations of configuration and application files. I simply never tried to understand what those variables are and why they begin with XDG. Recently, I have stumbed upon several software configurations where I have encountered XDG variables again. So, I decided to look it up and find out what all of that was about."

I couldn't see my own hand in front of my face! Thankfully, Opus and o3 (I'll just refer to them as AI; all queries were sent to one or both, and distinguishing between them is not important to the story) massively helped me, and, I believe, essentially saved me from it becoming a permanent issue. Eventually, I was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease called MOG-associated disease (MOGAD). I'm not sure what this looks like going forward. But, here, I'd like to tell my story. This is part medical case study, part personal story, and part AI capabilities demonstration."

    "Description": "It was the turn of the millenium when I got my first computer fresh at university.  Windows seemed uninteresting, it was impossible to work out how it worked or write programs for it.  SuSE Linux 6.2 was much more interesting to try and opened a world of understanding how computers worked and wanting to code on them.  These were the days of the .com boom and I went to big expos in London where they showered you with freebies and IBM competed with SuSE and Red Hat for the biggest stall.  IBM said that Linux had made it on the server and now was going to take over the desktop so I realised that working with KDE would be a good idea.  And as a novice coder it was very perfect for learning Qt and how open development worked and I loved the free software ideals.  Going to the pre-Akademy conference (it was called Kastle then) in Nove Hrady was a great intro to the community in person and in some ways I learnt more about software development in a week there then my years at uni."
