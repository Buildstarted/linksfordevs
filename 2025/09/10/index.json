It is not about legibility but it is about perception of legibility. Does the CEO look at burndown charts in your project management tool? Maybe, but highly unlikely. Does the head of product look at the key user flows that are getting implemented? Maybe. Does the EM look at the backlog of technical debt and prioritize items out of that backlog? Maybe, but if the organization is small enough and the EM is hands-on and smart - they “just go and do things”. In nearly all the situations I’ve seen, the implementation of processes targeted at legibility were actually optics in disguise. We are now writing user stories because the person who became the CPO wants to establish that practice. We have a this-or-that process because the executive – or the key stakeholder – wants it implemented in a specific way. Or - because they do not care"
