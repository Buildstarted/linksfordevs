The quality of the images it creates is the best among all contemporary models by a large margin. However, what is most interesting is the way it seems to generate the image: first it quickly creates a blurry version of the final image, then sharpens it from top to bottom, as if loading an image on a dial-up connection. This shouldn't be possible using a standard latent diffusion model, which would generate the whole image at once. What could they be doing different? As why is it better?"

In general, the experience of using the web with a good content blocker should be noticeably faster, as you skip downloading and executing many megabytes of code, images, and videos that provides you with no benefit. I’ve run content blocking extensions since they were first introduced and I’ve never looked back.\n\nSafari 15, released in September 2021, was the first version to support extensions, including content blocking extensions. This was a huge improvement to mobile browsing on iOS, which doesn’t offer any choice of browser besides Safari. Safari finally had a way to fight back against intrusive ads just like other browsers. I chose to use 1Blocker, which was highly reviewed by Apple aficionados at the time, though I’m sure there are other good alternatives.\n\n"

    "Description": "One striking feature of modern artificial intelligence, especially in large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, is their ability to instantly generate surprisingly advanced software engineering solutions. One interpretation of this phenomenon is that we are in the midst of a wave of commoditization. A specific subset of cognitive work, once scarce and expensive, has become infinitely accessible at minimal cost. With the rise of “vibe coding”, where AI tools are used transform a basic idea into a functional app or website almost instantly for fun, it seems that any basic concept for a digital product can now be cloned on the spot. The barrier to entry has dropped dramatically, while the bar for uniqueness has risen just as fast. Any simple enough product can be replicated instantly. Are we witnessing the rapid commoditization of cognitive work, with software engineering at the forefront?"
