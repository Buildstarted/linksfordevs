This post hopes to build on the prior posts on sequent calculus and linear logic to show how par is not such an alien concept after all, and make the theory much more accessible. We'll naturally stumble into constructive/computational classical logic along the way!"

Our plain old everyday binary search invariant can be summarized as such:\nFor all x in L[0:l]1, x is strictly less than T, the element we are searching for. For all y in L[r:len(L)]2, y is strictly greater than T, the element we are searching for. Or, if we want to be even terser, we could note this as simply"
