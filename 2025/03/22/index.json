    "Description": "The internet is fast—until it’s not. Nobody likes waiting for a sluggish API response, and overloaded servers don’t help either. That’s where caching comes in. RESTful APIs embrace caching to improve performance, reduce server load, and create a smoother user experience. But caching isn’t just about speed—it’s about efficiency. Let’s dive into how REST makes caching an essential part of scalable web applications."

We’re shifting from creators to orchestrators, from builders to overseers. From engineers to something that looks suspiciously like… managers."
