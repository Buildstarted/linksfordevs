With our own hands, our own minds, our own code.\nBut that identity is being challenged.\nAI coding assistants aren’t just changing how we write software - they’re fundamentally transforming who we are. We’re shifting from creators to orchestrators, from builders to overseers. From engineers to something that looks suspiciously like… managers."
