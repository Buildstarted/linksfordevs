Building on the Qwen2.5-VL series, we continued to optimize the model using reinforcement learning and open-sourced the new VL model with the beloved 32B parameter scale under the Apache 2.0 license — Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct. Compared to the previously released Qwen2."

    "Description": "Of all the REST constraints, Code on Demand is the one that most developers either overlook or actively avoid. Unlike the other five constraints, it is the only optional one, meaning a RESTful system doesn’t have to use it. But when applied correctly, it can unlock powerful capabilities in web applications. Let’s explore what Code on Demand is, when it makes sense to use it, and why most REST APIs don’t rely on it."
