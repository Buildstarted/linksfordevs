Unlike the other five constraints, it is the only optional one, meaning a RESTful system doesnâ€™t have to use it. But when applied correctly, it can unlock powerful capabilities in web applications. Letâ€™s explore what Code on Demand is, when it makes sense to use it, and why most REST APIs donâ€™t rely on it."
