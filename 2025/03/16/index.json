Configuring routing can actually be a headache because as the needs become more complex, the difficulty of configuration tends to increase exponentially, also considering potential conflicts. Using ipset is certainly good, but the workload doesn’t diminish, it becomes greater sometimes. To address this need, I chose PBR, aka Policy-Based Routing, simplifying this complex problem with some simple configuration scripts."
