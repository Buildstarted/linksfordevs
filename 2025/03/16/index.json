However, this foreseeable future quickly vanished along with my smile. What was bound to happen eventually came, but I didn’t expect it to arrive so soon. What could possibly require such a large boot partition? And how should we resolve this? Here, I would like to introduce the boot partition issue I encountered, as well as temporary coping methods and final solutions, mentioning the problems encountered along the way for reference."

    "Domain": "blog.fernvenue.com",
    "Description": "Playing around with OpenWrt often involves multiple outbounds, maybe multiple ISPs or VPN outbounds like WireGuard. We always need to configure and route the traffic. Configuring routing can actually be a headache because as the needs become more complex, the difficulty of configuration tends to increase exponentially, also considering potential conflicts. Using ipset is certainly good, but the workload doesn’t diminish, it becomes greater sometimes. To address this need, I chose PBR, aka Policy-Based Routing, simplifying this complex problem with some simple configuration scripts."

In the context of web services, its most important property is the ability to serve multitudes of users at the same time. This article explores how Postgres makes it possible by examining what can go wrong when transactions from multiple users interweave - it covers isolation levels and possible anomalies, along with ways to avoid them"
