    "Description": "RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Podcasting Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n Show Notes \"And I think this is really the key factor in software development. I think it's really to keep complexity low, because in most projects, unless you are writing an operating system, a framework or rocket navigation you are not coding against hardware; like the hardware is not your bottleneck. You are coding against human brains, cognitive abilities of your team; like how many smart people your company is able to put on your team, this is your limiting factor so we need to keep complexity low and I think it's really the most important benefit.\"‚Äî Gael Fraiteur\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am not your host: Jamie. I'm Delilah and I will be recording the intro for this episode because Jamie is suffering with a throat infection.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Gael Fraiteur joined us to talk about Metaprogramming with Metalama. Gael is the original author of the wildly successful PostSharp and has been working with the aspect-oriented programming pattern for over 20 years. In this conversation we talk about how metaprogramming (regardless of whether you use Metalama to achieve that or not) can save on both the complexity and the number lines of code in your projects.\r\n\r\n \"Well, there are studies that try to correlate the cost of software projects to the number of lines of code. And the conclusion is: it is more or less a linear dependency. A bit super linear. That means that if you have 15% fewer lines of code, you are going to get 15% lower development cost. So that's the easiest part\"‚Äî Gael Fraiteur\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n My voice was created using Generative AI.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/metaprogramming-with-gael-fraiteur/\r\n\r\n Gael's Links:  Gael on LinkedIn PostSharp on LinkedIn  Metalama:  Metalama homepage Documentation Marketplace GitHub  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.

With .NET MAUI, you can achieve this easily in just a few steps. Let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ\n\n\n\n\nLet's get started! üöÄ\nThe first thing you should know when you hear or read about the term soft input keyboard is that it refers to the virtual keyboard that appears on the screen when entering text.\n\nWhat are SoftInputExtensions?\nIn .NET MAUI, several UI elements, such as Entry and Editor, accept text input and automatically interact with the soft input keyboard. With SoftInputExtensions, we can take full control of its visibility using extension methods, allowing us to easily show or hide the keyboard as needed.\n\nSoftInputExtensions Methods\nThe SoftInputExtensions class provides the following methods:\nüîπ HideSoftInputAsync ‚Äì Hides the soft input keyboard if it is currently visible.\nüîπ ShowSoftInputAsync ‚Äì Displays the soft input keyboard if it is currently hidden.\nüîπ IsSoftInputShowing ‚Äì Returns a boolean value indicating whether the soft input keyboard is currently displayed on the screen. - ‚úçÔ∏è I recommend using this method before deciding whether to show or hide the soft input keyboard.\n\nHow to implement it\n\n\n\n\nSpanish article\n\n \thttps://es.askxammy.com/como-mostrar-y-ocultar-el-teclado-en-net-maui/\n\nReferences\nThis article was based on the official documentation.\n\n \thttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/entry?view=net-maui-8.0&viewFallbackFrom=net-maui-7.0\n"
