    "Description": "Last Tuesday at 1 AM, I was debugging a critical production issue in my AI dev tool. As I dug through layers of functions, I suddenly realized — unlike the new generation of developers, I was grateful that I could actually understand my codebase. That’s when I started thinking more about Karpathy’s recent statements on vibe coding. For those who missed it, Andrej Karpathy recently shared his thoughts on what he calls “vibe coding” — essentially surrendering code comprehension to AI tools and hoping for the best. His exact words? “I ‘Accept All’ always, I don’t read the diffs anymore.” I have learnt a lot from Karpathy and use AI tools daily, but there’s a world of difference between augmenting your capabilities and completely surrendering your understanding."

    "Description": "As a geek, I love the idea of running LLMs locally, and owning my entire AI stack without depending on cloud APIs. I run LLMs locally with Ollama all the time. I’d love to see a world where the intelligence that these models provide is democratized, cheap and plentiful.\nBut if I think about it objectively there are several reasons local LLMs going mainstream might not happen.\nWidely used utilities want to be centralized\nIn the early days of electricity, factories generated their own electricity on-site. This phase was relatively short-lived, giving way to the centralized power grid we have now. The same thing happened with water, trash disposal, manufactured goods and pretty much every staple of modern life."

    "Description": "•\t“But LLMs are not deterministic!”\nThe most common retort to my “LLMs are compilers” framing is:\n\n“… but compilers are deterministic, LLMs just generate probabilistic output!”\n\nI think that retort is not even wrong, and I’ll explain why.\nThe analogy’s central idea was not that LLMs replicate every characteristic of compilers, but that using natural-language-driven LLMs is another large step up in abstraction. Traditional compilers enabled programmers to express themselves in high-level languages instead of assembly. Similarly, LLMs empower programmers to express their intent directly in natural language, translating it into code."
