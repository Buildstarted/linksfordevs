    "Description": "We’ve all been there: headphones on, music pumping, fingers flying across the keyboard, lost in the “flow” with your favorite AI agent. This, my friends, is vibe coding. It’s when you’re in the zone, seemingly effortlessly producing code.\nIt’s the idea that you can create great software simply by immersing yourself in the feeling of coding, trusting your intuition and riding the wave of inspiration. But lately, I’ve realized that for me, at least, the vibe is…off."

Instead, New Haven R-II school employed a different set of letters that meant the same thing. They were E S M I F. I have no idea how this came to pass, but I hope it was because some person seeking a doctorate in education realized that his dissertation was due tomorrow and he had nothing. Frankly, I could get behind that kind of education theory. Beats modern pedagogy, anyway."

    "Description": "Last Tuesday at 1 AM, I was debugging a critical production issue in my AI dev tool. As I dug through layers of functions, I suddenly realized — unlike the new generation of developers, I was grateful that I could actually understand my codebase. That’s when I started thinking more about Karpathy’s recent statements on vibe coding. For those who missed it, Andrej Karpathy recently shared his thoughts on what he calls “vibe coding” — essentially surrendering code comprehension to AI tools and hoping for the best. His exact words? “I ‘Accept All’ always, I don’t read the diffs anymore.” I have learnt a lot from Karpathy and use AI tools daily, but there’s a world of difference between augmenting your capabilities and completely surrendering your understanding."

I’d love to see a world where the intelligence that these models provide is democratized, cheap and plentiful.\nBut if I think about it objectively there are several reasons local LLMs going mainstream might not happen.\nWidely used utilities want to be centralized\nIn the early days of electricity, factories generated their own electricity on-site. This phase was relatively short-lived, giving way to the centralized power grid we have now. The same thing happened with water, trash disposal, manufactured goods and pretty much every staple of modern life."

Traditional compilers enabled programmers to express themselves in high-level languages instead of assembly. Similarly, LLMs empower programmers to express their intent directly in natural language, translating it into code."
