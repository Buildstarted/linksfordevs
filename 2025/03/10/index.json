    "Description": "The introduction of automatically focusing lenses has changed photography in numerous ways. Autofocus systems have significantly improved the reliability and accuracy with which fast moving objects can be shot. Round four decades ago, the new level of convenience offered by autofocus lenses has made photography more accessible to the masses. Since their first release of an autofocus lens in 1981, Canon has constantly developed their lens technology using different approaches. Over time, Canon has introduced seven different autofocus motor technologies that will be presented here."

Not so fast. But there is a ConcurrentDictionary we can use!\n\nEviction strategy for cached items in the collection? Not out of the box.\n\nWhat about entry expiration? Nope -- not without rolling your own.\n\nBut that's exactly why I have relied on BitFaster Caching for these use cases. Simple. Easy to use. Gets the job done.\n\nLearn more about it and more in the caching for beginner's video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM5mxZdqeGc"
