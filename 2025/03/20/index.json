Recently I was digging into the benefits of the Inference Extensions for the Kubernetes Gateway API and I needed to generate some load for the backend LLMs I deployed (Llama, Qwen, etc). I ended up building an LLM load generation tool because I thought my use case needed some specific controls over how the test was run. In the end, I think about 90% of what I built was fairly generic for an LLM load test tool and I probably could have just tweaked the last 10% with an existing load tool to do what I needed. Nevertheless there were a few important things I learned about generating load against an LLM. Follow me (@christianposta /in/ceposta) for more thoughts on LLM perf as I will reslease some benchmarking results of running LLM inference workloads on GPUs in Kubernetes.\n\n"
