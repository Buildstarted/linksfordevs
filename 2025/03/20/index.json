    "Description": "A well-designed REST API isn’t just a random collection of endpoints—it follows a set of principles that make it predictable, scalable, and easy to use. One of the core constraints of REST is the Uniform Interface. This principle ensures that APIs are structured consistently, reducing complexity for both developers and systems interacting with them."
