    "Description": "I’ve written about leverage in the past. But now that I’m deeper into my career (and a founder), it’s worth revisiting. Leverage is the principle with which I frame nearly all of my decisions. It is almost inarguably the central pillar around which all outsized outcomes revolve — so I view such an obsession as a worthy pursuit. As Archimedes said - “give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.”"

Some say they wish they were a carpenter, some want to be in the fields on a farm, some want to raise chickens, or milk cows. It is however inevitable that I either hear someone say it or agree with it at some point. Often, the sentiment is accompanied by a general dissatisfaction with the impact of the speaker’s work or profession. Maybe someone just got a particularly mind-numbing feature request, or spent several weeks arguing in meetings about several pixels of padding for text on a button on a support page in a single app."
