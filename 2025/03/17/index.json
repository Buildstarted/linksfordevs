I hadn’t been able to find much time to work on the project, but thanks to Cursor and Claude Sonnet, I was able to make progress. Basically, the entire project was carried out using that assisted coding tool—I hardly touched any code, and my role was mostly to communicate to Claude what I was looking to build."
