    "Description": "Model Merging is a weird and experimental technique which lets you take two models and combine them together to get a new model. This is primarily used in Large Language Models, where the likely convergent representations allow this technique to work somewhat better than you might expect, given the concept. Model merging techniques are interesting since they allow researchers to create new models which are somehow performant in new ways despite not doing any additional training. I think this is really weird, so I need to know about it."

I had no idea what the Common Lisp ecosystem for those things looks like, so it was time to find out."
