This is primarily used in Large Language Models, where the likely convergent representations allow this technique to work somewhat better than you might expect, given the concept. Model merging techniques are interesting since they allow researchers to create new models which are somehow performant in new ways despite not doing any additional training. I think this is really weird, so I need to know about it."
