Recent studies have demonstrated that RL can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of models. For instance, DeepSeek R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating cold-start data and multi-stage training, enabling deep thinking and complex reasoning.\nOur research explores the scalability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its impact on enhancing the intelligence of large language models."
