    "Description": "A while back, I wrote A sad day for Rust about the Actix-web unsafe\ncontroversy. The short of it was, Actix-web was using some unsound unsafe code.\nWhen this was discovered, people responded pretty harshly, and the maintainer\nquit. Others picked up the work, but it still wasnâ€™t great:"
