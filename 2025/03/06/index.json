Recent studies have demonstrated that RL can significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of models. For instance, DeepSeek R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating cold-start data and multi-stage training, enabling deep thinking and complex reasoning.\nOur research explores the scalability of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its impact on enhancing the intelligence of large language models."

The short of it was, Actix-web was using some unsound unsafe code.\nWhen this was discovered, people responded pretty harshly, and the maintainer\nquit. Others picked up the work, but it still wasnâ€™t great:"
