These things just happen to you. Well maybe not to you, but they happen to me. Unlike the video player, this isn’t just rendering Snake inside tmux. The entire game—input, game logic, and rendering—is done using tmux config files. You just load tmux with this config, and you’ll have..."

    "Description": "Picking the technology stack for a project is an important and consequential decision. In the enterprise space in particular, it often involves a multi-year commitment with long-lasting implications on the roadmap of the project, the pace of its development, the quality of the deliverables, and even the ability to assemble and maintain a happy team.The open-source software model is a fundamental answer to this. By using software that is developed in the open, anyone is free to extend it or modify it in whatever way fits their use case. More crucially, the portability of open-source software gives developers and organisations the freedom to move their infrastructure between different providers without fear of getting locked in to a specific vendor.This is the expectation with Next.js, an open-source web development framework created and [governed by Vercel](https://nextjs.org/governance), a cloud provider that offers managed hosting of Next.js as a service."

The pushback kicks in when I start citing data, up until then my listeners appear surprised/skeptical.  The fact that source code has a brief and lonely existence is accepted, but telling them about the (one study) evidence that a coding mistake is more likely to disappear because of an unrelated coding change than as a result of fixing a fault report appears to make them feel uncomfortable."

To make it work, we needed to properly plan for it."
