Well, in this blog, I’ll take you on a fun ride through the magical world of DNS resolution. Whether it’s Google’s famous 8.8.8.8 or Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1, you’ll finally understand what’s happening when you type a domain into your browser.\nDNS: Your Internet’s Phonebook 📖 DNS (Domain Name System) is basically the internet’s way of giving websites easy to remember names instead of expecting you to memorize IP addresses (because let’s be honest, no one remembers 172.217.14.206). No matter how often an IP address changes, you only need to remember the domain name, and DNS takes care of the rest."
