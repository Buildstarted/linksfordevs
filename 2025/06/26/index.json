    "Description": "Gemini released a new developer oriented CLI tool. This tool has a relatively generous free tier of 60 requests per minute, 1000 requests per day. When large language models (LLMs) were initially released, there was a lot of fear that it would automate many white collar jobs: however, their unreliability and risk for off-the-rails behavior in tasks without easy verification or ground truths. Developer oriented tooling seems to be a better fit for a productivity tool that depends on validation."

    "Timestamp": "2025-06-26T23:02:43",
    "Domain": "danieltan.weblog.lol",
    "Description": "Agent Lineage Evolution (ALE) is a novel framework that addresses the dual challenge of LLM agent degradation and manual prompt engineering bottlenecks. As LLMs inevitably degrade over extended usage, requiring frequent context restarts, current approaches force humans to manually re-engineer prompts with learned optimizations for each restart. ALE eliminates this scaling limitation by enabling agents to automatically generate successor prompts with embedded behavioral knowledge, transforming inevitable degradation cycles into opportunities for automated prompt evolution."

You will learn how to find ideas, approach development and manage time, deal with burnout, and learn from my mistakes.In the end of the article, I also showcase my latest side project betterlingo.app and talk why I decided to build another project after a big break. I hope my experiences and advice will help you on your own path."

They devised a form that each engineer was required to submit every Friday, which included a field for the number of lines of code that were written that week."
