The great thing about teaching is that you are quickly forced to confront a lot of things that you otherwise might easily ignore, avoid or simply be unaware of."

Klein and Thompson propose a renaissance of our public institutions- an invigorated era where government “gets out of the way” of itself and executes on projects only it can do."
