    "Description": "Traditional computer programs rely on rigid logic, yet the real world is full of ambiguity. The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) means that computer programs can now make “good enough” decisions, like humans can, by introducing a powerful new capability: judgment. Having judgment means that programs are no longer limited by what can be specified down to the level of numbers and logic. Judgment is what AI couldn’t make robust before LLMs. Practitioners could program in particular logical rules or build machine learning models to make particular judgments (such as credit worthiness), but these structures were never broad enough or dynamic enough for widespread and general use. These limitations meant that AI and machine learning were used in pieces, but most programming was still done in the traditional way, requiring an extreme precision that demanded an unnatural mode of thinking. LLMs are changing this entirely."
