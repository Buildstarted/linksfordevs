I could write a book on how strongly I subscribed to this area of thought, but that’s not the point of this post; you’ll have to trust that the following comes from someone who climbed out of the pit:\nEverything matters. And that’s even scarier.\nI still don’t believe in broad concepts like “meaning” or “fulfillment”. I believe in biological reactions that make something feel meaningful or fulfilling. Those reactions are what matters, and I think nihilism’s pull is strongest on those who lack them. But we can hack our minds."
