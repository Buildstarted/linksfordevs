    "Description": "Many developers seem to have a fanatic obsession with monospace fonts and using them to make their blogs look “cool”. I won’t call out anyone’s blog specifically, but you don’t have to look to hard to find some. As an example theme using a monospace font by default, look at hugo-theme-terminal, which has over 2,400 stars on GitHub. If you have a blog or are thinking about starting one, and you are writing mostly prose (you probably are), I have one suggestion for you about fonts:\nDo not use monospace fonts for prose."

What I’ve noticed instead is that the industry has kind of organized itself around three different ways of optimizing, and understanding this might be more useful."
