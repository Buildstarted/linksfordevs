    "Description": "Imagine entering the biggest library in the world. You peer down an incredibly long aisle with wooden bookshelves brimming with books. You can see multiple such corridors, all lit with a comfortable warm light. There’s a rich smell of old paper. You can hear some muted voices, perhaps arguing in a whisper. It’s perfect, but vast and difficult to make sense of. Just this day, it doesn’t feel like such a terrible ordeal to just wander for a while, see where your legs take you. Maybe you’ll find something interesting completely by accident? The prospect is both exhilarating and daunting. The library appears endless, it feels like you could potentially find all sorts of exotic and interesting book collections."

    "Description": "I loved writing a lot as a teenager and college student, since it was the easiest and most natural way to express myself and connect with others. Even now, years later, I can read my old writing and feel connected with my past self and derive something new from it.\nI’ve been writing less in the last ten years because I’ve been busy with adulthood and juggling between English and Chinese. I used to write in Chinese, and now mostly write and communicate in English. However, I hadn’t given much thought to my own “writing voice” in either language till recently."

This lead to me building a quick-and-dirty verifier listing tool."
