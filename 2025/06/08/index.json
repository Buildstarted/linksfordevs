I have since worked on chatcraft.org, various RAG frameworks, etc. I use aider heavily for work, frequently switch models, have been struggling with tool calling during dark ages before MCP."

It existed on only one of my Proxmox instances (I can't replicate between them because the original instance doesn't use zfs. oops) so if the virtual machine or physical machine was unreachable for whatever reason, it effectively blocked my access to any service in my homelab Kubernetes cluster, and also broke communication between nodes and the Kubernetes API. It didn't happen often, and the fix was often trivial, but it still bothered me. Coupled with the fact that until recently the Kubernetes cluster also acted as a reverse proxy to services hosted on Proxmox and my NAS (read more about that stuff here), it could cause a wider outage than just what's on the cluster."

It’s perfect, but vast and difficult to make sense of. Just this day, it doesn’t feel like such a terrible ordeal to just wander for a while, see where your legs take you. Maybe you’ll find something interesting completely by accident? The prospect is both exhilarating and daunting. The library appears endless, it feels like you could potentially find all sorts of exotic and interesting book collections."
