    "Description": "In May 2022, someone posted to Hacker News Bartosz\n          Ciechanowski's\n          blog post\n        explaining how mechanical watch movements work. Since then, his blog has\n        been my absolute favorite corner of the Internet. His posts are not just\n        well written and easy to follow, the accompanying interactive\n        illustrations are magnificent."
