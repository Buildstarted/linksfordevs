    "Description": "Since I created Lazygit back in 2018, I’ve managed to find time for it outside my day job. I’ve had a blast spending countless afternoons, weekends, and most of my annual leave on the project, but since founding my own startup, Subble, it’s become ever harder to give Lazygit the time it deserves. So, in order to prevent myself from becoming a blocker on progress, I’ve decided to step back and hand over the reins to my co-maintainer Stefan Haller.\n\n"

    "Description": "Preamble# The internet is the bane of my existence. Ads, distractions, sponsored content, bad news, bad ideas, more ads, social media, antisocial media, even more ads.\nAlso, I’m a software developer, so the internet is basically indispensable for me, a central pillar of my income and a convenient way to communicate with friends, family, loved ones, associates, acquaintances, people from my sports club, superpositions of all previous groups and enemies alike. And I think my company runs ads, so in a way ads pay for my clothing and food and stuff. So I guess my current stance towards the internet would be somewhat neutral-ish, but that may still change."

    "Description": "React Server Components are hard to grok and building a mental model of how they work has proven to be difficult to many of us. But, despite the general discourse, they are not confusing for the sake of being confusing, and they are not a conspiracy to sell server cycles. Beneath the abstraction is fundamentally strong engineering that has unlocked both UX and DX gains that were previously inaccessible. I think it's worthwhile to learn their design and what problems they truly solve."

I bought a smart light and put it in a place where it could be easily seen."
