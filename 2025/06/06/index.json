After all, \"it looks fine, and I'm an\nartist\"."

    "Description": "TL;DR\nIf you don’t have time to read the whole article, the following four takeaways are a concise version. You can navigate to the corresponding section in the article for details.\n\nLack of framework: A GenAI application is not a GenAI foundation model; different frameworks are required to evaluate them. There may be a lack of clarity on the difference between the two tasks.\nUnstructured data: The unstructured output of a GenAI application makes evaluation more difficult than a traditional ML system.\nFoundation model unpredictability: GenAI foundation model usually introduces extra unpredictability into the evaluation process.\nLonger and more costly iteration: GenAI application evaluation is expensive and time consuming, because building evaluation dataset and running tests on GenAI application require more resources.\n\nIntroduction\nI have spent the last two and a half years listening to what businesses want from GenAI, building GenAI applications, and delivering value from the applications. It has been an interesting journey, as I realized the advent of ChatGPT constitutes a paradigm shift for ML/AI practitioners like me. I started to believe that GenAI would change our lives, similar to personal computers in the 90s or the modern search engine in the 2000s."
