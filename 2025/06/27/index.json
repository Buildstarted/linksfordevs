Well in this post I’m doing exactly that. If you haven’t read that post, please do.\nHosting a website is not that hard. Anyone with Linux server could do it in few key strokes but it’s not that easy on phone. Modern phone operating systems have locked down the phones to a point that anything like hosting website feels like a wild idea."

To me LLMs are more of a research tool like Stack Overflow. I ask it questions about stuff I want to do.\nIt is something for filling my gaps in knowledge. So at the end of the day, I often prefer my own judgement & style. As I don’t think vibe coding is an advantage."
