Why am I doing it?\nAnd one day in 2021, I found a beautiful message from Naval:\n\n“A calm mind, a fit body, a house full of love.\nThese things cannot be bought - they must be earned.”"

    "Description": "Airtable recently launched “Omni” which is their conversational agent that can spin up full Airtable apps like tables, interfaces, automations and then keep working inside them as an analyst or workflow bot. All paid and free plans now ship with bundled AI credits, and Airtable positions this as an app builder,” replacing drag-and-drop with vibe-coding that’s backed by production-grade components. I am personally interested in this because a lot of our portfolio companies here at Accel are in various stages of getting into the vibe coding space and I wanted to see what a $10B company could come up with here. Its extra interesting because Airtable already owns the data and the kind of products they can build should technically be 10x better than a chrome extension running on top of your Google sheets. The CEO calls it a refounding moment and you can read the launch blog post here."
