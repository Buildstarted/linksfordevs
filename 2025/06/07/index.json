    "Description": "I've been maintaining\nFreeBSD on the\nAmazon EC2 platform ever since I\nfirst got it booting in 2010, but in\nNovember\n2023 I added to my responsibilities the role of FreeBSD release\nengineering lead — just in time to announce the availability of\nFreeBSD 14.0, although Glen Barber did all the release engineering work for\nthat release.  While I receive a small amount of funding from\nAntithesis and from my\nFreeBSD/EC2 Patreon, it\nrapidly became clear that my release engineering duties were competing\nwith — in fact, out-competing — FreeBSD/EC2 for my available\nFreeBSD volunteer hours: In addition to my long list of \"features to\nimplement\" stagnating, I had increasingly been saying \"huh that's weird...\noh well, no time to investigate that now\".  In short, by early 2024 I was\nbecoming increasingly concerned that I was not in a position to be a good\n\"owner\" of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform."
