    "Description": "A few weeks ago, I had a conversation that’s stayed with me. A colleague from another department said: “I’ve always been able to read and understand code, even debug it, but I could never write it.”\nSomething about this revelation stayed with me. Most people I’ve met outside the software engineering world tend to describe code as unintelligible - like hieroglyphics. I guess that’s why I’ve always assumed: if someone couldn’t write code, they probably couldn’t read it either."

    "Description": "Sometimes, in the middle of life, out of nowhere, random snapshots from the past pop into our minds. It could happen while\nwalking, reading a book, or watching a view. For me, it usually happens when I’m coding or looking at a landscape. This time,\nwhile I was coding, a snapshot from more than 20 years ago came to mind.\nI was a kid, maybe around ten. We had a music CD at home. This was the late ’90s or early 2000s, so we used Sony Walkmans to\nlisten to music. I really liked that CD back then, but I couldn’t remember its name or the cover clearly, just some blurry\nfragments. A few words stuck in my mind: “Webb” and “Ocean.” These two were clear. I immediately started searching online, hoping\nto find a digital version. But the deeper I looked, the more surprising the result was: absolutely nothing. It was like the\ninternet had forgotten it. Search engines only showed recent, popular content. It felt like they had erased the past."
