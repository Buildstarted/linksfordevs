    "Description": "Thanks to war, geopolitics, and climate change, Europe will have more\nfrequent and more severe internet\ndisruptions\nin the very near future. Governments and businesses need to prepare\nfor catastrophic loss of communications. Unfortunately, the necessary\nchanges are risky and expensive, which means they won’t do it until a\ncrisis is already here. However, small\ngroups of volunteers with a little bit of time and money can provide\ncrucial initial leadership to bootstrap recovery."

    "Description": "The Starlink Mini terminal is designed as a compact, all-in-one solution with an integrated Wi-Fi router. While this design is ideal for typical consumer use, certain applications—such as custom networking setups, embedded installations, or power-constrained environments—may benefit from removing the internal router entirely. In this article, I’ll detail the process of physically removing the built-in Wi-Fi router board from the Starlink Mini, allowing the terminal to operate solely via Ethernet and offering greater flexibility for advanced users."
