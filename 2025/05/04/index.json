    "Description": "When you hear hyperparameter tuning, you might think of trying lots of different model settings to find the best one—maybe using grid search, random search, or some fancy algorithm.

You have a bunch of models to try, but you can’t run them all fully."

On a risk-adjusted basis, it’s been a horrible financial decision. However, it’s also been the most professionally fulfilled I’ve ever been in my life, and if we succeed in executing on our vision, the financial payoff could make it even better."
