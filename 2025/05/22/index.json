The newly released GitHub Copilot agent was given permission to make pull requests on Microsoft’s .NET runtime, and the results couldn’t be funnier. The AI confidently submitted broken code, while human developers patiently explained why it didn’t work. Over and over again, for days. I feel bad for the engineers in this PR, but I also can't stop laughing. What’s worse is that CEOs are using this same technology to justify laying off entire engineering teams."

I actually used Apple Music regularly (and previously Spotify), but the streaming turned out to be more convenience than necessity.

Unsurprisingly, I quickly became hooked on the NixOS Linux distribution, and before long, I was running it on every machine I owned… first at home, then even at work (shhht!). As the obsession grew, so did the project. It naturally expanded to support a wide variety of systems: from a simple Intel-based laptop, to a Raspberry Pi router tucked away in the basement, and even an old iMac from 2012. Each machine came with its own quirks and specific requirements. Like many personal setups, what started as a clean and elegant solution gradually evolved into a tangled web of host-specific hacks and duplicated logic."

    "Description": "I originally wanted to write 2 distinct articles, but realized that they shared the same underlying idea: \"Vibe coding\", the act of talking to an LLM / LLM-based AI agent to code a full project without writing a line of code manually, is no more than a metaprogramming technique, where a program (the AI agent), produces another program (the code that gets committed). As such, it shares some common characteristics of metaprogramming, notably: 1) The use-case of using metaprogramming when lacking an abstraction. 2) The poor experience of maintaining metaprogramming output when you can't maintain the generator level."
