I describe a\nphenomenon I call \"hyper-typing\", where libraries - in pursuit of perfect type\nsafety - end up with overly complex types that are hard-to-understand, produce\ncryptic errors, and paradoxically even lead to unsafe workarounds.\n\n\nI argue that simpler types, or even type generation, often lead to a more\npractical and enjoyable developer experience despite being less \"perfect\".\n\n"
