    "Description": "Did you ever need to wake up at 5 am to go to the morning lecture where you are fighting for your life to stay awake and learn anything? Well, I know I did and it was a time when I kept myself focused by playing some logic games in the background. You know logic games like Minesweeper, simple games that once you learn you can solve absentmindedly. One game I kept thinking about over and over is Flip(which is an implementation of “Lights Out”). Computers solve this game by just solving a system of linear equations, but I wanted to find a method that 5 am me could absentmindedly use. Well, I didn’t find it but I found a way to solve that specific system of equations with much fewer operations. And that different way of solving it is the topic of this blog post."

    "Description": "The RP2350 is a nice microcontroller from Raspberry Pi. Recently I thougt about a new project, where a lot of PWM channels would be needed. The RP2350B has 24 PWM channels, which is a lot - but not enough. I would need at least 33 PWM channels, and also some more GPIOs, so the RP2350 alone isn't enough. So I thought about a port expander... But what about using a second RP2350 as a port expander?"

These\nsoft labels can then be used to train other models, without true labels\nbeing required at any stage. I’ve included a simple example from first\nprinciples to show that the methods work. The original authors have a fully\nfeatured package called Snorkel which\nprovides sophisticated data programming and related features."

Formalizing metatheory is a topic that is interesting to\nbeginner and experienced proof assistant users alike, but rife with tricky\ntechnical issues that can dissuade one from making much progress.
