    "Description": "This week a fellow B12er was performing an ad-hoc data analysis. They had a spreadsheet with some data, and wanted to classify the rows in the spreadsheet by a few different criteria along which they would look for trends. For an engineer, this would have been a quick Python script wrapping some classifier (in our case, the OpenAI API), but there wasn’t an engineer available for the project. We looked at some third-party plugins for Google Sheets, but it wasn’t clear what sorts of guarantees they made around data privacy, and we didn’t feel comfortable installing them. So, with some help from OpenAI’s o3, I created Rich, an OpenAI-powered CSV data enricher that’s a fully client-side single-page application."

Today I want to share some of the latest changes in how to approach solving.\nThe idea for the solver was that manually installed packages are always protected from removals – in terms of SAT solving, they are facts. Automatically installed packages become optional unit clauses. Optional clauses are solved after manual ones, they don’t partake in normal unit propagation."

But the thing that is most disheartening to me is how at every step along the way, nobody cared."
