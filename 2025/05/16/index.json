It was like six sheets of paper and it was very complex, and it was very useful to have it on the wall because, like, you could always look at it and say, \"okay, this is going on before this one.\" So you have to like switch the order of things. But that's exactly what I call interesting\"— Tomáš Herceg\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie \"GaProgMan\" Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, we talk with Tomáš Herceg about strategies for modernizing .NET Framework web applications such that they leverage the very latest in the .NET stack. Tomáš shares his insights from the journey of upgrading his own applications and those of his clients, both of which provided the background for his new book: \"Modernizing .NET Web Applications\".\r\n\r\n \"The biggest problem of the YARP migrations: that they will force you to do a lot of infrastructure things at the beginning before you even start migrating some real functionality.\"— Tomáš Herceg\r\n\r\n Along the way, we discuss how using his DotVVM project can help with the migration. Not only is the upgrade path for DotVVM projects a process of swapping a NuGet package, but is also keeps the upgrade as a single in-memory process—something that YARP-based migrations aren't able to do.\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/dotnet-web-app-modernization-made-easy-with-tomas-hercegs-new-book-and-dotvvm/\r\n\r\n Links:  DotVVM DotVVM.Owin DotVVM.AspNetCore Yarp Strangler Fig Pattern Modernizing .NET Web Applications Gauss Curve (aka Normal distribution) Tomáš on LinkedIn  Model-view-ViewModel  Supporting the show:  dotConnect 30 day trial Entity Developer 30 day trial Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
