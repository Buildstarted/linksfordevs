From doing maths fast with numpy to padding strings with left-pad, there was almost always a library that could help. Even now half the time you want to integrate your app with some other application it ships its API as a small library of useful functions. As much as I do like writing code to solve difficult problems, the project manager in my head is telling me “don’t reinvent the wheel”, so naturally I use a lot of libraries."

Engagement numbers and all that.\nThese companies run mass content scraping campaigns to train their own slop models and provide servers to other slop companies in the same data centers their crawlers operate from. Every word I’ve thrown into this illustrious publication—the reading of which a total of five people have, at various times, expressed mild enjoyment—has been both silently and explicitly declared fair game by the slop companies. The only positive thing I can egotistically hope to grasp about this development is that a distant and diluted abstraction of my words and thoughts could be subtly influencing the thoughts and decisions of people around the world—the same way a pinch of salt would affect the flavor profile of a large vat at the soup factory, or like the breeze under the wings of chaos theory’s cute and frighteningly powerful butterfly mascot."

As such, it shares some common characteristics of metaprogramming, notably: 1) The use-case of using metaprogramming when lacking an abstraction. 2) The poor experience of maintaining metaprogramming output when you can't maintain the generator level."
