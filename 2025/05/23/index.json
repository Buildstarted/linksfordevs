    "Description": "Warning: Math, Handwaving\n\nI spent a lot of time doodling in middle school in lieu of whatever it is middle schoolers are\nsupposed to be doing. Somewhere between the Cool S’s\nand Penrose triangles I stumbled upon a neat\nway to fill up graph paper by repeatedly combining and copying squares. I suspected there was\nmore to the doodle but wasn’t quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that\nknows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high\nschool to college to the present day.\n\n"
