Think again.\n\nIn this video, I show how one missing filter in your API can leak sensitive user data — and how to prevent that with PostgreSQL's built-in Row-Level Security (RLS).\n\n✅ We’ll build a real .NET Core API using EF Core and Postgres  \n✅ Show how to extract user IDs from JWT tokens  \n✅ Use an EF Core interceptor to safely set session variables  \n✅ Enable and configure RLS in Postgres for bulletproof data isolation\n\nProtect your multi-tenant systems. Stop depending on app-layer filters alone.\n\n💡 Perfect for .NET devs building secure, multi-tenant apps.\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Typical Authorization Checks\n2:58 Row-Level Security intro\n7:33 Adding an EF Core Interceptor\n9:54 DI setup, User configuration\n11:00 Testing out RLS policy\n12:10 Multi-Tenant systems"

I suspected there was\nmore to the doodle but wasn’t quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that\nknows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high\nschool to college to the present day.\n\n"
