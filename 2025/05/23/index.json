    "Description": "Ever wanted to search or perform question answering on documents, PDFs, or web pages but weren't sure about costs or security? Kernel Memory is a .NET library that allows you to use whatever embedding and text models you'd like (including Ollama and OpenAI models) and whatever vector store you'd like to index and search documents in a flexible way using a minimal amount of C# code."

    "Description": "Warning: Math, Handwaving\n\nI spent a lot of time doodling in middle school in lieu of whatever it is middle schoolers are\nsupposed to be doing. Somewhere between the Cool S’s\nand Penrose triangles I stumbled upon a neat\nway to fill up graph paper by repeatedly combining and copying squares. I suspected there was\nmore to the doodle but wasn’t quite sure how to analyze it. Deciding to delegate to a future version of me that\nknows more math, I put it up on the wall behind my desk where it has followed me from high\nschool to college to the present day.\n\n"
