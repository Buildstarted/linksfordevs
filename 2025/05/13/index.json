    "Description": "Branch Privilege Injection (CVE-2024-45332) brings back the full might of branch target injection attacks (Spectre-BTI) on Intel. Intel’s hardware mitigations against these types of attacks have held their ground for almost 6 years. In our work, we demonstrate how these mitigations can be broken due to a race condition in Intel CPUs."

In this video, I’ll walk you through a full MediatR-free CQRS implementation using custom `ICommand`, `IQuery`, and handler interfaces.\n\n✅ We’ll cover:\n- Why I decided to remove MediatR\n- How to build your own CQRS abstractions\n- Replacing ISender with explicit handler injection\n- Manual DI vs automatic scanning using [Scrutor](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scrutor)\n- Fully working Command & Query pipeline without third-party libraries\n\nYou'll see how to:\n- Refactor a .NET API endpoint from MediatR to your own handler\n- Register handlers manually and automatically\n- Handle generic result types for commands and queries\n\n👉 Want to skip ahead and use the updated template?\nCheck the pinned comment for a link to the Clean Architecture template without MediatR.\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Why MediatR and CQRS\n1:44 ICommand and IQuery abstractions\n4:33 Registering handlers with DI\n5:21 Using handlers in endpoints (or services)\n7:47 Completing the refactoring\n10:32 A better way to register handlers with DI\n13:55 The problem with cross-cutting concerns"
