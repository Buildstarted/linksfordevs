To date, tooling for producing documents using JBIG2 (particularly open source tooling) has been limited; I have previously presented file-jbig2pdf, a GIMP plugin for generating PDF files using JBIG2. This suffices for simple black-and-white documents, but does not assist when documents contain both black-and-white text and colour graphics."
