While Google provides a client library for Spanner (@google-cloud/spanner), the JavaScript (Node.js/Bun) ecosystem lacks a dedicated Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) specifically designed for Spanner’s native Google SQL dialect. This gap prompted an experiment: could Google’s Gemini assist in rapidly developing one? This post details that journey and introduces spanner-orm, a Google SQL ORM in Bun largely created with AI help over a weekend."
