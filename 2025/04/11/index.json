Let’s look at what arenas are, how you can run into trouble when naively using them with dynamic arrays and what you can do instead.\nWhat’s an arena? How does it work? Arenas and arena allocators are useful for grouping allocations that have the same lifetime."

You pause sometimes to review, but mostly you’re moving forward to make it work. As your project grows, keeping track of everything becomes tricky. Code that worked perfectly yesterday suddenly breaks today, and you’re not sure why. You keep switching between files and conversations, losing your flow. There’s no clear picture of what’s happening, making you wonder if you’re making real progress."

Armed with Microsoft’s continuous, fleet-wide performance profiler, I embarked on a journey\nto find the places where my service was allocating the most memory and fix the unnecessary allocations by using the newly\navailable .NET APIs. In this blog post, I’ll show you some common code patterns that can be found in .NET Framework code,\nalong with their modern, high-performance alternatives."
