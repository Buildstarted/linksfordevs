The precipitating event is that the admin of the instance hosting the associated accounts demanded they be made nigh-undiscoverable, but the underlying cause is that it‚Äôs become increasing clear that Mastodon isn‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt ever be, a good platform for ‚Äúasynchronous ephemeral notifications of any kind‚Äù. I‚Äôd also argue (more controversially) that it‚Äôs simply not good infrastructure for social networking of any kind. There are lots of interesting people using Mastodon, and I‚Äôm sure it will live on as a good-enough space for certain niche groups. But there is no question that it will never offer the fun of early Twitter, let alone the vibrancy of Twitter during its growth phase. I‚Äôve long since dropped Mastodon from my home screen, and have switched to Bluesky for text-centric social media."
