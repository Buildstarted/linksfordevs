The CVE database is critical for anyone doing vulnerability management or security research, and for a whole lot of other uses. There isn't really anyone else left who does this, and it's typically been work that is paid for and supported by the US government, which is a major consumer of this information, btw.\n\nI reached out to MITRE, and they confirmed it is for real. Here is the contract, which is through the Department of Homeland Security, and has been renewed annually on the 16th or 17th of April.\n\nhttps://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001\n\nMITRE's CVE database is likely going offline tomorrow. They have told me that for now, historical CVE records will be available at GitHub, https://github.com/CVEProject\n\nYosry Barsoum, vice president and director at MITRE's Center for Securing the Homeland, said:\n\n‚ÄúOn Wednesday, April 16, 2025, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE¬Æ) Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE‚Ñ¢) Program, will expire.  The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE‚Äôs role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.‚Äù"
