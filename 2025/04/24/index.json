    "Description": "We have solved a traveling salesman problem (TSP) to walk to 81,998 bars in South Korea.\nThe problem was created using the Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM) to build a table of the 3,361,795,003 point-to-point travel times, one for each pair of bar locations.\nOur computation produced a tour together with a proof that it is a shortest-possible route to visit all 81,998 stops when measured with the OSRM times."

    "Description": "Today Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky pointed out that the font used in the infamous \"You wouldn't steal a car\" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language (https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v)\n\nShe also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name \"XBAND Rough\". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).\n\nSo I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! ðŸ“Ž"
