    "Description": "Today Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky pointed out that the font used in the infamous \"You wouldn't steal a car\" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language (https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v)\n\nShe also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name \"XBAND Rough\". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly found a PDF from the campaign site with the font embedded (https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf).\n\nSo I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time! ðŸ“Ž"
