I’ve now realized I much prefer this approach over some combination of terseness, weird dedicated syntax, macros, magics, etc.\nWhile working on a little side project I’m doing just for fun (and to learn), I encountered an “interesting” data structure that I wanted to extract a couple of fields from. Initially I thought it to be a basic dictionary-like data structure but I soon realized it was a bit more convoluted."
