Reports indicate these models not only hallucinate more often than previous versions but also demonstrate an uncanny ability to determine photo locations. This duality of increased factual errors alongside unexpected geolocation proficiency has raised concerns among users and experts regarding model reliability and potential privacy implications. The coverage highlights both the technical achievements and challenges of incorporating these advanced AI capabilities."
