The quality of service is on another level. Workers are more involved and friendly, which makes daily life way more pleasant. You can find any type of services, like someone waiting for you at a restaurant, sending an item for you.. You can received products in 20 min. Cities are a bit less walkable, some big ones are massive, and it can feel overwhelming at times. The food is so fxcking great, super diverse, and cheap. Tourism is also built mainly for Chinese people, which makes it fascinating to experience from the outside. They build so much infrastructure for Chinese tourism—sometimes it can be weird because you find empty villages, shopping malls, hotels… People don’t really talk politics unless they’re very close. What stands out most is how safe it feels. You can leave your bag in public and it’ll still be there, maybe not in nightclubs tho. As a girl, being able to walk at night without fear is priceless. The worst thing you can experience at a party is being too drunk. There are no drugs. I haven’t seen homeless people either. Streets are clean."

These articles highlight a longstanding issue in tech recruiting: puzzle-style assessments have little to no correlation with actual job performance(Konnikova 2013; McAllister 2013), and leetcode is nothing but algorithmic puzzles. This makes them a poor predictor of job performance. What leetcode does predict seems to be success at leetcode style interviews(Mroczka 2024). Go figure.\nIf you are in power to stop doing these silly things and reach for something with actual evidence of working, here is a blueprint for performing a structured interview with a focus on programmers, but that can be adapted for other positions quite easily."
