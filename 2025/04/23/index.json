    "Description": "Pinterest‚Äôs OmniSearchSage represents a major step forward in unified semantic search. By extending the two-tower model into a multi-task, multi-entity framework, it enables a single query embedding to power retrieval across pins, products, and related queries. The system integrates GenAI captions, user-curated board metadata, and behavioral signals to overcome sparse content, while maintaining compatibility with legacy models like PinSage. Deployed at massive scale, OmniSearchSage delivers strong gains in search fulfillment, ad performance, and downstream tasks, showcasing a pragmatic and scalable approach to representation learning in production."

Nix DSL enables you to declaratively specify your projects\ndependencies, a repo or a tar-ball down to the file digest of its\ncontent, which is what gives nix superpowers of being a deterministic\nand reproducible package manager. This means that if your inputs stays\nthe same, nix guarantees that it produces the exact same output\nregardless of when and where. Below is a flake that pulls in latest\nversion of Clojure into your project."
