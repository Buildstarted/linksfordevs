I showed a hand-written NEON assembly implementation of a kernel that computes y[n]=ax[n]+b, which I used as the basic math block for benchmarks on a Kria KV260 board (which has a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 at 1.33 GHz). In that talk I glossed over the details of how I implemented this NEON kernel. There are enough tricks and considerations that I could make a full talk just out of explaining how to write this kernel. This will be the topic for this post."

    "Description": "Three years ago, I was part of a team responsible for developing and maintaining Kubernetes clusters for end user customers. A main source for downtime in customer environments occurred when image registries went down. The traditional way to solve this problem is to set up a stateful mirror, however we had to work within customer budget and time constraints which did not allow it. During a Black Friday, we started getting hit with a ton of traffic while GitHub container registries were down. This limited our ability to scale up the cluster as we depended on critical images from that registry. After this incident, I started thinking about a better way to avoid these scalability issues. A solution that did not need a stateful component and required minimal operational oversight. This is where the idea for Spegel came from."
