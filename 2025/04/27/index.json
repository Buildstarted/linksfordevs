    "Description": "Welcome to ARK000 — the kickoff for ARK (Acts of Random Kindness) 🌟\nThis is an open source, nonprofit project to build a mobile app that encourages people to do something kind every single day — and share their stories, photos, or videos with the world. No ads. No catch. Just good people doing good things.\n\nIn this stream:\n0/ What is ARK?\n1/ Why kindness needs its own platform\n2/ How we're building it (Blazor MAUI 🚀)\n3/ How you can get involved (code, design, ideas, support)\n\nIt’s free — as in free tea and free speech. 🍵🗣️\nIf you’re looking for something positive to build, you’re in the right place.\n\nLet’s make something beautiful together."
