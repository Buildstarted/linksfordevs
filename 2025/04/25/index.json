Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ\nWant to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\n\nIn this comprehensive tutorial, I demonstrate how to implement semantic search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search in a .NET application. Unlike traditional keyword-based search which looks for specific terms, semantic search understands the meaning behind your queries, providing more intuitive and powerful search capabilities.\n\nI'll walk you through:\n- Understanding vector embeddings and how they work\n- Setting up MongoDB Atlas Vector Search\n- Generating embeddings from your content using local LLMs\n- Implementing vector search queries in .NET\n- Pre-filtering search results for better performance\n\nLearn how MongoDB can function as both your primary document database and vector database, eliminating the need for separate specialized systems. This tutorial includes complete code examples for generating embeddings, creating vector search indexes, and implementing semantic search in a movie database application.\n\nWhether you're building AI-powered search, recommendation systems, or just want to improve your application's search experience, this tutorial will show you how to leverage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for powerful semantic understanding.\n\nMore docs: Adding MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to a .NET Blazor C# Application\nhttps://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/csharp/vector-search-with-csharp-driver/\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Why MongoDB Atlas\n1:16 Vector Search and MongoDB\n5:29 Exploring the sample application\n8:59 Creating a MongoDB Atlas DB\n11:27 Creating a Vector Search Index\n16:17 Generating embeddings with MEAI\n24:39 Implementing Vector Search with MongoDB"
