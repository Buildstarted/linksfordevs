    "Description": "A recent event got me thinking. Why do we give social media that much power over our lives? I‚Äôm fairly young, but I‚Äôve had an experience of life without social media as it exists today. There was a time when we gauged how close certain friends were using more realistic metrics. Or at least I thought we were. A friend recently got into an argument with their real life bestfriend, mainly because one was not the other‚Äôs number one best friend on Snapchat, leaving my friend very confused. If you don‚Äôt use Snapchat a lot, you probably won‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, so here‚Äôs some brief context. Snapchat assigns ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù tags to people you interact with, based on some algorithm that isn‚Äôt public. Now, was the person who got jealous wrong? Maybe not. But it‚Äôs alarming to witness the level of trust and reliance a person can place on such tagging to make real life decisions and judgments. I, for one, am not sure how exactly the tagging works because I do not work at Snapchat, but the more you interact with someone, the higher they appear on their best friend list. Yes, there‚Äôs a ranking as well, absurd. My whole issue is with Snapchat. Judging who someone‚Äôs best friend is, based solely on conversation frequency, is weird. Conversations have so much more depth to them, and context matters in every conversation*. The whole gist of such tagging is uncalled for and should be an opt-in feature. Well, enough of me ranting. I can only control what I can control, so I‚Äôve deleted Snapchat. My friend is, on the other hand, still treading the considerate route, soothing the ego of someone who seems a bit out of touch with reality."

Go here: https://bit.ly/3PupkOJ\nWant to unlock Modular Monoliths? Go here: https://bit.ly/3SXlzSt\n\nIn this comprehensive tutorial, I demonstrate how to implement semantic search using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search in a .NET application. Unlike traditional keyword-based search which looks for specific terms, semantic search understands the meaning behind your queries, providing more intuitive and powerful search capabilities.\n\nI'll walk you through:\n- Understanding vector embeddings and how they work\n- Setting up MongoDB Atlas Vector Search\n- Generating embeddings from your content using local LLMs\n- Implementing vector search queries in .NET\n- Pre-filtering search results for better performance\n\nLearn how MongoDB can function as both your primary document database and vector database, eliminating the need for separate specialized systems. This tutorial includes complete code examples for generating embeddings, creating vector search indexes, and implementing semantic search in a movie database application.\n\nWhether you're building AI-powered search, recommendation systems, or just want to improve your application's search experience, this tutorial will show you how to leverage MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for powerful semantic understanding.\n\nMore docs: Adding MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to a .NET Blazor C# Application\nhttps://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/csharp/vector-search-with-csharp-driver/\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Why MongoDB Atlas\n1:16 Vector Search and MongoDB\n5:29 Exploring the sample application\n8:59 Creating a MongoDB Atlas DB\n11:27 Creating a Vector Search Index\n16:17 Generating embeddings with MEAI\n24:39 Implementing Vector Search with MongoDB"
