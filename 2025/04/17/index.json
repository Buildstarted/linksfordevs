I’m doing everything on Linux, mostly using FFMPEG for video conversion and serving the video myself, from a web server in my house.\nObviously, there are many services that you can pay to do this all for you, and most of them will do a better job at it most of the time, for a fee. But they may not be that much better, depending on your needs, and video streaming really isn’t that hard anymore.\nAll you need is a bit of time and a website."
