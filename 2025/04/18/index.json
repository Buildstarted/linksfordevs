In this video, I reveal why most speakers waste this critical window and how you can use the \"cold open\" technique to instantly captivate your audience.\n\nHi, I'm James, a storytelling technologist who's spoken at over 30 conferences worldwide. I've experienced it all‚Äîfrom people scrolling through their phones to audience members falling asleep in the front row. Let me help you avoid these speaking disasters.\n\nWhat You'll Learn:\n- Why starting with your bio is killing your talk before it even begins\n- How to use the \"James Bond technique\" to hook your audience immediately\n- The exact moment when you should introduce yourself (hint: it's not when you think)\n- Two contrasting real-life examples that demonstrate effective vs. ineffective openings\n- How to establish credibility without boring your audience\n\nThis video builds on our previous lesson about making the audience the hero of your story and shows you exactly how to put this principle into practice in those crucial first moments on stage.\n\nüîó Want more speaking tips?

    "Description": "RJJ Software's Software Development Service This episode of The Modern .NET Show is supported, in part, by RJJ Software's Software Development Services, whether your company is looking to elevate its UK operations or reshape its US strategy, we can provide tailored solutions that exceed expectations.\r\n\r\n Show Notes \"So on my side it was actually, the interesting experience was that I kind of used it one way, because it was mainly about reading the Python code, the JavaScript code, and, let‚Äôs say like, the Go implementations, trying to understand what are the concepts, what are the ways about how it has been implemented by the different teams. And then, you know, switching mentally into the other direction of writing than the code in C#.\"‚Äî Jochen Kirstaetter\r\n\r\n Welcome friends to The Modern .NET Show; the premier .NET podcast, focusing entirely on the knowledge, tools, and frameworks that all .NET developers should have in their toolbox. We are the go-to podcast for .NET developers worldwide, and I am your host: Jamie ‚ÄúGaProgMan‚Äù Taylor.\r\n\r\n In this episode, Jochen Kirstaetter joined us to talk about his .NET SDK for interacting with Google‚Äôs Gemini suite of LLMs. Jochen tells us that he started his journey by looking at the existing .NET SDK, which didn‚Äôt seem right to him, and wrote his own using the HttpClient and HttpClientFactory classes and REST.\r\n\r\n \"I provide a test project with a lot of tests. And when you look at the simplest one, is that you get your instance of the Generative AI type, which you pass in either your API key, if you want to use it against Google AI, or you pass in your project ID and location if you want to use it against Vertex AI. Then you specify which model that you like to use, and you specify the prompt, and the method that you call is then GenerateContent and you get the response back. So effectively with four lines of code you have a full integration of Gemini into your .NET application.\"‚Äî Jochen Kirstaetter\r\n\r\n Along the way, we discuss the fact that Jochen had to look into the Python, JavaScript, and even Go SDKs to get a better understanding of how his .NET SDK should work. We discuss the ‚ÄúPythonistic .NET‚Äù and ‚Äú.NETy Python‚Äù code that developers can accidentally end up writing, if they‚Äôre not careful when moving from .NET to Python and back. And we also talk about Jochen‚Äôs use of tests as documentation for his SDK.\r\n\r\n Anyway, without further ado, let's sit back, open up a terminal, type in `dotnet new podcast` and we'll dive into the core of Modern .NET.\r\n\r\n Supporting the Show If you find this episode useful in any way, please consider supporting the show by either leaving a review (check our review page for ways to do that), sharing the episode with a friend or colleague, buying the host a coffee, or considering becoming a Patron of the show.\r\n\r\n Full Show Notes The full show notes, including links to some of the things we discussed and a full transcription of this episode, can be found at:  https://dotnetcore.show/season-7/google-gemini-in-net-the-ultimate-guide-with-jochen-kirstaetter/\r\n\r\n Jason's Links:   JoKi's MVP Profile JoKi's Google Developer Expert Profile JoKi's website  Other Links:   Generative AI for .NET Developers with Amit Bahree curl Noda Time with Jon Skeet Google Cloud samples repo on GitHub Google's Gemini SDK for Python Google's Gemini SDK for JavaScript Google's Gemini SDK for Go Vertex AI JoKi's base NuGet package: Mscc.GenerativeAI JoKi's NuGet package: Mscc.GenerativeAI.Google System.Text.Json gcloud CLI  .NET Preprocessor directives .NET Target Framework Monikers QUIC protocol  IAsyncEnumerable Microsoft.Extensions.AI  Supporting the show:  Leave a rating or review Buy the show a coffee Become a patron  Getting in Touch:  Via the contact page Joining the Discord  Remember to rate and review the show on  Apple Podcasts, Podchaser, or wherever you find your podcasts, this will help the show's audience grow.
