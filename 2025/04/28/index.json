    "Description": "As a computer science undergrad in the mid-90s, my ‚ÄúIntroduction to Programming‚Äù course in the very first semester was modeled after the legendary ‚ÄúStructure and Interpretation of Computer Programs‚Äù by Abelson and Sussman.\nFor a quarter-century at MIT, Abelson, Sussman, and colleagues used Scheme to teach freshmen how to manufacture abstractions almost artisanally from scratch. Rooted in the Lisp ethos, the premise was that by understanding a handful of primitives and mastering a small set of combinators, students could build a platonic ladder of abstractions‚Äîa veritable cathedral of computation‚Äîand still reason about every brick. This pedagogical approach involved first creating abstractions to model the problem domain, effectively designing a custom language in which the final solution could then be expressed cleanly, almost self-evidently."
