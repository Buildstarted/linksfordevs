Unusually warm, in fact, for those late days in March – as if spring decided to bless my piligrimage, for that piligrimage was not jovial. I was sitting at a ramen joint, sipping on the broth. To my left, a blue, crinkled supermarket shopping bag was sitting solemnly, inconspicuously. Inside that bag sat a slightly used Mac Studio, which I have just purchased to be able to edit CSS of my own application. By the time that evening descended upon the south of Amsterdam, I have lost 3 days of my life trying to figure out why I was unable to edit CSS. But let me rewind a bit."
