Not long after Jon Van Caneghem, the founder of New World Computing, sold his company to 3DO, it started to become obvious to everyone who worked for him that the torch he carried for computer games no longer burned as brightly as it once had. A younger version of Van Caneghem had spent almost three years designing and programming Might and Magic I, the CRPG that introduced New World to our world, virtually all by himself. Now, he was coming into the office just two or three times a week, leaving even on most of the days when he did make an appearance by shortly after lunchtime. His all-dominating current passion, it was becoming clear, was racing sports cars on tracks all over California and beyond. His colleagues sensed that, in his mind, he had already created his magnum-opus CRPG with Might and Magic IV and V, two big games that could be combined into one to form The World of Xeen, an absolutely massive one. Meanwhile he had poured all of his best strategy ideas into The King’s Bounty and Heroes of Might and Magic. He was ready to take two steps back from the day-to-day at New World, to become a part-time designator emeritus and spend the rest of his time driving his cars."

It contrasts bold predictions and massive investments with underwhelming flagship releases, framing today’s AI era as less about building godlike intelligence and more about integrating imperfect tools into real-world products. The piece suggests that the true future of AI lies not in transcendence, but in the messy, necessary work of making these systems actually useful."
