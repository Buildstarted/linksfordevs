    "Description": "This essay dissects the widening gap between AI hype and reality, arguing that large language models have hit a plateau - the “S-curve” - despite industry claims of imminent superintelligence. It contrasts bold predictions and massive investments with underwhelming flagship releases, framing today’s AI era as less about building godlike intelligence and more about integrating imperfect tools into real-world products. The piece suggests that the true future of AI lies not in transcendence, but in the messy, necessary work of making these systems actually useful."
