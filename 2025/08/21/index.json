From the batter‚Äôs perspective, two pitches can travel through the same ‚Äútunnel‚Äù partway to the plate before diverging. What looked like a hittable fastball suddenly drops off the table - a devastating curveball for a swinging strike. Effective tunneling neutralizes a batter‚Äôs ability to recognize a pitch, forcing a split-second, and often wrong, decision."
