From the batter’s perspective, two pitches can travel through the same “tunnel” partway to the plate before diverging. What looked like a hittable fastball suddenly drops off the table - a devastating curveball for a swinging strike. Effective tunneling neutralizes a batter’s ability to recognize a pitch, forcing a split-second, and often wrong, decision."
