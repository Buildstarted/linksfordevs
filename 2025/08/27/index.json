    "Description": "In undirected graphs with real non-negative weights, we give a new randomized algorithm for the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem with running time $O(m\\sqrt{\\log n \\cdot \\log\\log n})$ in the comparison-addition model. This is the first algorithm to break the $O(m+n\\log n)$ time bound for real-weighted sparse graphs by Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci heaps. Previous undirected non-negative SSSP algorithms give time bound of $O(mα(m,n)+\\min\\{n\\log n, n\\log\\log r\\})$ in comparison-addition model, where $α$ is the inverse-Ackermann function and $r$ is the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum edge weight [Pettie & Ramachandran 2005], and linear time for integer edge weights in RAM model [Thorup 1999]. Note that there is a proposed complexity lower bound of $Ω(m+\\min\\{n\\log n, n\\log\\log r\\})$ for hierarchy-based algorithms for undirected real-weighted SSSP [Pettie & Ramachandran 2005], but our algorithm does not obey the properties required for that lower bound. As a non-hierarchy-based approach, our algorithm shows great advantage with much simpler structure, and is much easier to implement."
