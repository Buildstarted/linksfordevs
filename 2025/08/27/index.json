    "Description": "\nA few months ago, someone noted in the comments that they hadn't heard about the Therac-25 incident. I was surprised, and went off to do an informal survey of developers I know, only to discover that only about half of them knew what it was without searching for it.\nI think it's important that everyone in our industry know about this incident, and upon digging into the details I was stunned by how much of a WTF there was.\nToday's article is not fun, or funny. It describes incidents of death and maiming caused by faulty software engineering processes. If that's not what you want today, grab a random article from our archive, instead.\n\nWhen you're strapping a patient to an electron gun capable of delivering a 25MeV particle beam, following procedure is vitally important. The technician operating the Therac-25 radiotherapy machine at the East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC) had been running this machine, and those like it, long enough that she had the routine down.\n"

    "Description": "In undirected graphs with real non-negative weights, we give a new randomized algorithm for the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem with running time $O(m\\sqrt{\\log n \\cdot \\log\\log n})$ in the comparison-addition model. This is the first algorithm to break the $O(m+n\\log n)$ time bound for real-weighted sparse graphs by Dijkstra's algorithm with Fibonacci heaps. Previous undirected non-negative SSSP algorithms give time bound of $O(mα(m,n)+\\min\\{n\\log n, n\\log\\log r\\})$ in comparison-addition model, where $α$ is the inverse-Ackermann function and $r$ is the ratio of the maximum-to-minimum edge weight [Pettie & Ramachandran 2005], and linear time for integer edge weights in RAM model [Thorup 1999]. Note that there is a proposed complexity lower bound of $Ω(m+\\min\\{n\\log n, n\\log\\log r\\})$ for hierarchy-based algorithms for undirected real-weighted SSSP [Pettie & Ramachandran 2005], but our algorithm does not obey the properties required for that lower bound. As a non-hierarchy-based approach, our algorithm shows great advantage with much simpler structure, and is much easier to implement."
