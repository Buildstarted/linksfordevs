They're about to blow another $3 billion on Windsurf, a coding assistant that's essentially Microsoft Copilot's twin brother. And then there's Stargate: a $500 billion fever dream where OpenAI promises to invest $19 billion of the same funny money for the privilege of paying Oracle $30 billion annually starting in 2028."
