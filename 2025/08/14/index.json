Raised by a mother determined to scrub away “poetical insanity” with pure logic, Ada Lovelace grew into a woman who sketched flying machines while bedridden with measles, dazzled London’s elite at soirees with her grasp of mathematics, and secretly ran a horse-racing betting syndicate powered by math. She created the first computer program ever for a machine that wouldn’t exist to run it until more than a century beyond her lifetime."
