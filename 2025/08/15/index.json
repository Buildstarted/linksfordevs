That was the pitch behind WSDL in the Web 2.0 era‚ÄîWeb Services Description Language‚Äîan XML contract where a service declared its operations, messages, and types so tools could generate clients automatically. If you‚Äôve never seen it, the original specs still read like a time capsule: WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0."
