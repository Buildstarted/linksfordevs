    "Description": "In January of 1995, Electronic Arts bought the prestigious British games studio Bullfrog Productions for an undisclosed sum that was rumored to be in the neighborhood of $45 million. The lives of the 35 or so people who worked at Bullfrog were transformed overnight. Peter Molyneux, the man who had build the studio’s reputation on the back of his “god game” Populous six years earlier, woke up the morning after the contract was signed with real money to spend for the first time in his life. For him and his colleagues, the new situation was gratifying, but also vaguely unsettling."

MCP feels like the good part of the old web-services dream brought forward for AI agents: describe what you can do, let a generic client discover it, and integrate without bespoke glue. That was the pitch behind WSDL in the Web 2.0 era—Web Services Description Language—an XML contract where a service declared its operations, messages, and types so tools could generate clients automatically. If you’ve never seen it, the original specs still read like a time capsule: WSDL 1.1 and WSDL 2.0."
