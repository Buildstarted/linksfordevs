There isn’t a huge amount going on down there - the counties of Devon and Cornwall are, in England, often the places people go to retire. The average salary is £39.8k ($51.5k USD) - which was much less in around 2010 when I was sitting in my mom’s garden debating what I wanted to do with my life at age 20. I had a pretty misspent youth, but I loved computers - and I loved videogames. I’d even worked at one of the only web design agencies in the southwest of England - as an apprentice - for a huge £2/hour (£80/week).\n"
