    "Description": "It’s no secret that today’s LLM-based agents are unreliable. This makes them a gamble for most critical tasks, so where can they be safely applied? The answer lies in finding asymmetry: we should use them in domains where the downside of a mistake is low, but the upside of success is huge; a strategy Nassim Taleb calls antifragile."

    "Description": "We love TPUs at Google, but GPUs are great too. This chapter takes a deep dive into the world of NVIDIA GPUs – how each chip works, how they’re networked together, and what that means for LLMs, especially compared to TPUs. This section builds on <a href='https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/tpus/'>Chapter 2</a> and <a href='https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/training'>Chapter 5</a>, so you are encouraged to read them first."
