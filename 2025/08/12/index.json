    "Description": "I believe that language models aren’t world models. It’s a weak claim — I’m not saying they’re useless, or that we’re done\nmilking them. It’s also a fuzzy-sounding claim — with its trillion weights, who can prove that there’s something an LLM isn't a\nmodel of? But I hope to make my claim clear and persuasive enough with some examples."
