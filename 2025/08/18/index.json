    "Description": "Welcome to the fascinating world of High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Tone Mapping ‚Äî two essential techniques revolutionizing how light and color are rendered in digital media. In this video, we dive into the technical challenge of lighting overflow, where multiple light sources exceed the valid RGB color range, causing washed-out visuals.\n\nüî• See the list of the books that I'm using as background information for my tutorials: https://ogldev.org/books.html.
