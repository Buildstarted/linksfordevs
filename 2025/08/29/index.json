    "Description": "This is the story of the world's most beloved programming language: Python. What began as a side project in Amsterdam during the 1990s became the software powering artificial intelligence, data science and some of the world’s biggest companies. But Python's future wasn't certain; at one point it almost disappeared.\n\nThis 90-minute documentary features Guido van Rossum, Travis Oliphant, Barry Warsaw, and many more, and they tell the story of Python’s rise, its community-driven evolution, the conflicts that almost tore it apart, and the language’s impact on... well… everything. \n\nThanks to our sponsors for making this documentary possible:\nAnaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/ ‪@AnacondaInc. \nDropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/ @Dropbox \nMeta: https://opensource.fb.com/ ‪@FacebookOpenSource \nOpenTeams: https://openteams.com/ ‪@openteams \nPyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ ‪@PyCharmIDE \nQuansight: https://quansight.com/ ‪@quansight \n\nAnd to all the amazing people who are featured:\nArmin Ronacher, Barry Warsaw, Benjamin Peterson, Brett Cannon, Drew Houston, Guido van Rossum, Jessica McKellar, Ken Manheimer, Lambert Meertens, Lisa Guo, Lisa Roach, Mariatta Wijaya, Paul Everitt, Patrice Lyons, Peter Wang, Robin Friedrich, Robert Kahn, Sjoerd Mullender, Steven Pemberton, Tim O'Reilly, Ton Roosendaal, and Travis Oliphant.\n\nAdditional thanks to The Python Software Foundation and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI).\n\nPicture of Guido at Dropbox by Dan Stroud from Squero (Brand and Creative Studio) Squero.com \nPython comic (Import Antigravity) by xkcd: https://xkcd.com/353/\n\nFollow us:\nhttps://x.com/CultRepo/\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/cultrepo.bsky.social\nhttps://www.instagram.com/cult.repo/\n\nChapters\n00:00 - Intro\n01:10 - ABC - the predecessor to Python\n03:50 - The Amoeba system\n05:26 - Guido creating Python\n08:38 - Open source release\n10:36 - A growing community\n13:13 - Famous 1994 Workshop\n16:04 - Corporation for National Research Initiatives\n18:21 - Origins of the BDFL\n19:48 - Early scientific Python community (Travis Oliphant)\n21:45 - Importance of Python being open source (Blender)\n24:03 - Early Python contributors and the importance of fun\n25:25 - The Zen of Python\n27:56 - Tumultuous start-up life\n30:33 - Birth of the Python Software Foundation\n31:58 - The community is the true strength of Python\n34:39 - Growth: Web development (Dropbox)\n37:28 - Growth: Data science (Anaconda)\n41:23 - Dropbox hiring Guido\n42:59 - Python 3 (PY3K)\n55:21 - \"Python is for Girls\"\n58:30 - Mariatta's story\n01:06:05 - Growth: AI/ML (Meta)\n01:08:55 - Guido at PyCon\n01:10:46 - The Walrus Operator\n01:14:14 - Guido stepping down as BDFL\n01:16:35 - \"Can this work without Guido?\" (Governance)\n01:20:38 - Guido never expected Python's success\n01:21:25 - Python has taken over the world\n01:23:19 - Credits"

I figured: you\nput money in, you take money out, they're all the same. I also figured a local\nbranch of a global bank is just a fungible tentacle of the giant banking\nmachine, so also... who cares. Both incorrect assumptions, but let's relive and\nrediscover the effect of these assumptions as I did."
