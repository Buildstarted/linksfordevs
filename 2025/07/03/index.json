    "Description": "We’ve had decades of thought leadership around testing, especially coming from wholistic development philosophies like Agile, TDD, and BDD. After all that time and several supposedly superseding movements, the developers I talk to seem to have developed a folk wisdom around tests.\nThat consensus seems to boil down to simple but mostly helpful axioms, like “include tests for your changes” and “write a new test when you fix a bug to prevent regressions”. Unfortunately, one of those consensus beliefs seems to be “it is blasphemy to delete a test”, and that belief is not just wrong but actively harmful."

Joan writes extended thoughts, creating a pathway that explores the thought and relations.\nI love both of their blogs: one an excited friend sharing their moments another a more quiet person, but one that when they speak, I know I should give a listen. Crucial to both is that I receive their thoughts on my terms.\n"
