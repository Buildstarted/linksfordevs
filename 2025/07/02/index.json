The whole system is built with the LLVM toolchain.\n\n\nSince I started running the first alpha release of Chimera Linux in\n2023, my goal has been to eventually migrate to Chimera as my primary operating\nsystem. This includes personal tinkering as well as for my job as a programmer.\nA recent trip to Central Queensland afforded an opportunity to test the waters\nof daily driving Chimera Linux for work. The trip spanned two weeks and involved\nworking remotely (as usual) during the week, and sightseeing on the weekends.\nThis post details some of the barriers that I encountered and how I worked\naround them.
