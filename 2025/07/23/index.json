This actor system enables Swift programs to join a distributed Erlang cluster.  Here's an example of a simple chat program using the actor system:  Demo Video  Erlang (and other languages that run on its VM) can connect multiple runtime systems together with distributed Erlang. Each runtime is referred to as a \"node\". Erlang also supports \"C nodes\", which allow a program other ..."

Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we’re excited to introduce its most powerful variant first: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct — a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 35B active parameters which supports the context length of 256K tokens natively and 1M tokens with extrapolation methods, offering exceptional performance in both coding and agentic tasks. Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct sets new state-of-the-art results among open models on Agentic Coding, Agentic Browser-Use, and Agentic Tool-Use, comparable to Claude Sonnet 4."
