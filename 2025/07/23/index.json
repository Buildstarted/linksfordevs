Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we’re excited to introduce its most powerful variant first: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct — a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 35B active parameters which supports the context length of 256K tokens natively and 1M tokens with extrapolation methods, offering exceptional performance in both coding and agentic tasks. Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct sets new state-of-the-art results among open models on Agentic Coding, Agentic Browser-Use, and Agentic Tool-Use, comparable to Claude Sonnet 4."
