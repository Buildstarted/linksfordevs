    "Description": "Since Let&rsquo;s Encrypt started issuing certificates in 2015, people have repeatedly requested the ability to get certificates for IP addresses, an option that only a few certificate authorities have offered. Until now, they&rsquo;ve had to look elsewhere, because we haven&rsquo;t provided that feature.\nToday, we&rsquo;ve issued our first certificate for an IP address, as we announced we would in January. As with other new certificate features on our engineering roadmap, we&rsquo;ll now start gradually rolling out this option to more and more of our subscribers."
