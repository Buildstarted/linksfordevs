    "Description": "Discussions around memory safety often focus on choice of language, and how the language can provide memory safety guarantees. Unfortunately, choosing a language is a decision made at the start of a project. Migrating an existing C or C++ project to a safer language is much harder than starting a new project in a safe language1. I’m not going to say this is impossible, or that you can’t or shouldn’t migrate existing programs to safer languages. And sometimes people just do things in open-source, and that’s part of the fun of it."

Smart people share them via signal,smarter people, share them via a password manager like Bitwarden. Super-advanced people punch them into GitHub UI and only let github actions have access to secrets. Infra-devops people spin up Vault or AWS secret manager or similar to inject secrets. In all situations secrets have a lifecycle that is completely disconnected from code, causing the two to get out of sync or worse."

    "Description": "We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality frontier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 tokens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality. We discuss additional results on a variety of code benchmarks spanning multiple languages and use-cases as well as real-world validation by developers on Copilot Arena, where the model currently ranks second on quality and is the fastest model overall. We also release a public API at https://platform.inceptionlabs.ai/ and free playground at https://chat.inceptionlabs.ai"

This post explains why I believe Belgium is unsafe for people trying to do CVD. I believe it’s important to warn others so that they know what to expect and can decide for themselves."
