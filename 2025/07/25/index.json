    "Description": "A few months ago my partner-in-love-and-in-crime came with a seemingly innocuous request, which went as follows: We have an event coming up, and I need to send out a press release via email. It‚Äôs simple enough - just a couple of images and a few blurbs of text. I can‚Äôt seem to be able to make it look good in Gmail nor in Apple Mail. How does one do such a thing? Now, we computer-savvy household members know darn well that HTML email is, on the list of terrible IT things we have to help others with, right below the ‚Äúcan we get this printer to work?‚Äù. It can get‚Ä¶ challenging. And yet, given that I have done this ‚ÄúHTML email‚Äù thing for a while ‚Äì this piqued my curiosity. How hard can it be, thought I, to manually code an HTML email with images - and then use some Advanced Technology‚Ñ¢ to turn it into a proper HTML email? While doing that using current commercial platforms turned out to be very hard indeed - for reasons having nothing to do with technology ‚Äì I did come to an elegant solution that I came to appreciate. And it did allow me exactly what I wanted: Quickly layout an HTML email by source editing Turn it into an actual email Preview it in Apple Mail (on macOS and an iPhone) and in Gmail (desktop Web and iOS) ‚Ä¶rinse and repeat until it looks great And here‚Äôs the delightful surprise: the solution turned out to be not just functional, but genuinely elegant. It‚Äôs one of those rare moments where the constraints of email clients actually led to a cleaner, more maintainable approach than the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù alternatives. Instead of fighting with WYSIWYG editors or wrestling with complex templating systems, I ended up with a simple script that does exactly what I need - nothing more, nothing less. The real ‚Äúaha moment‚Äù came when I realized that the tools I needed were already sitting right there in my Rails stack, just waiting to be used in a slightly different way. Premailer, Nokogiri, and the Mail gem - these aren‚Äôt exotic dependencies or bleeding-edge libraries. They‚Äôre battle-tested, well-documented tools that handle the hard parts of email creation while giving you complete control over the output. It‚Äôs the kind of solution that makes you wonder why you didn‚Äôt think of it sooner. Curious where I ended up with that? Read on!"

    "Description": "In a previous post\n I showed some ways to improve tests by creating API mocks that we call. However, that‚Äôs not always enough, and we might need E2E tests (or acceptance tests), for example, to test integrations with databases, messaging services, or anything else. For these cases, I‚Äôm here to introduce the Testcontainers tool.\nThe Testcontainers\n library is an open-source tool that lets you create containers during test execution. The idea is for your application‚Äôs test dependencies to be part of the code, avoiding the need for mocks and even local dependency installation. Another big advantage is that it makes it easier to achieve test isolation and replicability among developers. The tool supports various programming languages like Go, Ruby, Elixir, Java, etc."

    "Description": "While working on Toad, it occurred to me there was a missing feature I would need. Namely streaming markdown. When talking to an LLM via an API, the Markdown doesn‚Äôt arrive all at once. Rather you get fragments of markdown (known as tokens) which should be appended to an existing document. Until recently the only way to render this in Textual was to remove the Markdown widget and add it again with the updated markdown. This worked, but it would get slower to append content as the document grew. It wasn‚Äôt a scalable solution."
