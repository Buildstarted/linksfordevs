    "Description": "For a number of years now I have a MacBook Pro Silicon M1 Max. It worked beautifully.\nThen, seemingly out of nowhere, I started noticing that the battery drained over night when I left the notebook somewhere, not connected to power. This got worse and worse, up until the point that I’ve had enough of it and I started doing some research.\nOn MacOS, the terminal command pmset -g log shows the logs related to power management."
