Will software engineers, especially junior ones, be able to find jobs in the future as coding agents become more powerful? Iâ€™m not a futurist, so Iâ€™ll make some observations informed by my own increasingly productive use of coding agents like Claude Code and Aider: Todayâ€™s best coding agents still very much require a human operator, To effectively use these coding agents in a professional context, you have to make some big changes to how you work, and There are many elements of professional software engineering that coding agents donâ€™t meaningfully enhance."
