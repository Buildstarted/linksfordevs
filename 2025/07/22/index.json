    "Description": "A decent amount of digital ink has been spilled about the future of software engineering in light of increasingly powerful coding agents. Will software engineers, especially junior ones, be able to find jobs in the future as coding agents become more powerful? I’m not a futurist, so I’ll make some observations informed by my own increasingly productive use of coding agents like Claude Code and Aider: Today’s best coding agents still very much require a human operator, To effectively use these coding agents in a professional context, you have to make some big changes to how you work, and There are many elements of professional software engineering that coding agents don’t meaningfully enhance."
