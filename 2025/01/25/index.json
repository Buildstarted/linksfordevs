    "Description": "Imagine you‚Äôre running a restaurant. Every time a customer orders, you buy a brand-new frying pan, use it once, and toss it out. Sounds absurd, right? But that‚Äôs essentially what happens in EF Core when you create a new DbContext for every request. It‚Äôs wasteful, slow, and totally unnecessary. Enter DbContext Pooling: the genius way to reuse those frying pans‚Äîerr, contexts‚Äîand turbocharge your app‚Äôs performance."

I'm calling it Tilde (or TB for tilde backend) and the reasons\nare pretty simple, i believe it's far too slow at compiling and far too big to be fixed from the\ninside. It's been 20 years and cruft has built up, time for a \"redo\"."

    "Description": "When the topic of Rails performance comes up, it is commonplace to hear that the database is the bottleneck, so Rails applications are IO-bound anyway, hence Ruby performance doesn‚Äôt matter that much, and all you need is a healthy dose of concurrency to make your service scale. But how true is this in general?"
