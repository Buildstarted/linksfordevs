    "Description": "I'm Yasser and I've made it my mission to produce an alternative to LLVM, the current\nking of compiler backend libraries. I'm calling it Tilde (or TB for tilde backend) and the reasons\nare pretty simple, i believe it's far too slow at compiling and far too big to be fixed from the\ninside. It's been 20 years and cruft has built up, time for a \"redo\"."

    "Description": "When the topic of Rails performance comes up, it is commonplace to hear that the database is the bottleneck, so Rails applications are IO-bound anyway, hence Ruby performance doesnâ€™t matter that much, and all you need is a healthy dose of concurrency to make your service scale. But how true is this in general?"
