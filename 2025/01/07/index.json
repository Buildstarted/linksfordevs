    "Description": "Programming has obvious abilities to increase productivity through automated manipulation of data.  Metaprogramming allows code to be treated as data, turning programming’s power back onto itself.  Programming close to the metal has perhaps the most to gain from metaprogramming as high level concepts need to be mapped precisely to low level operations.  Yet outside of functional languages I’ve always found the metaprogramming story to be a disappointment.  So when I saw that Zig lists metaprogramming as a major feature, I took interest."
