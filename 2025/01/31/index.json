    "Description": "Brands like Rolex and Omega will often tout their deepsea capabilities with the Rolex Deepsea Challenge rated to 11,000 meters (36,090 feet) and the Omega Ultra Deep coming in at a lesser but still ridiculous 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) of theoretical water resistance. But what about a cheap Casio often associated with terrorists and hipsters? With around $15 and some engineering know-how, can an affordable watch also venture into the deep ocean?"

You don‚Äôt need to write notes in the margins or keep tabs on which books you‚Äôve touched‚Äîyou‚Äôre just reading. That‚Äôs what no-tracking queries are in EF Core: a way to grab data without keeping track of changes. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and perfect for read-only operations. But wait, there‚Äôs more! Let‚Äôs throw identity resolution into the mix, a smart way to avoid duplicate entities when working with no-tracking queries. Together, they make a dynamic duo for blazing-fast data fetching, significantly reducing the time it takes to retrieve data from the database."

In this video, we'll tackle one of the biggest challenges in modern web applications: scaling webhook processing. I'll show you how to identify and fix common bottlenecks using RabbitMQ and MassTransit, transforming your webhook architecture from a potential system bottleneck into a robust, scalable solution. We'll start by demonstrating common webhook problems, then dive deep into implementing a message queue-based solution with RabbitMQ, and finally explore how to properly structure your application using MassTransit for reliable message processing. Whether you're handling dozens or thousands of webhook events, this step-by-step guide will show you the industry-standard approach to building a production-ready webhook system.\n\nBuilding Async APIs in ASP.NET Core - The Right Way\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/building-async-apis-in-aspnetcore-the-right-way\n\nUsing MassTransit with RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/using-masstransit-with-rabbitmq-and-azure-service-bus\n\nCheck out my courses:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/courses\n\nRead my Blog here:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog\n\nJoin my weekly .NET newsletter:\nhttps://www.milanjovanovic.tech\n\nChapters\n0:00 Webhooks - The bottleneck\n1:52 Demonstrating the problem\n3:11 Scaling with RabbitMQ \n5:28 Restructuring with MassTransit messaging\n15:26 Testing the improved solution"
