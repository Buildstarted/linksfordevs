    "Description": "If you’ve ever gone grocery shopping while hungry, you know how easy it is to end up with more than you need. The same thing happens in EF Core when you’re too eager with your Include statements—you fetch all the data, even the stuff you don’t need, and suddenly, your app feels sluggish. That’s where Explicit Includes comes in, allowing you to fetch only what you need when needed, making your development process more efficient. Think of it as grocery shopping with a list, but for your code."
