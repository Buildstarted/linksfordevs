    "Description": "Regarding memory management, programming languages take different approaches to ensure your applications don’t crash and burn. Think of it as cleaning up after a party: C# hires a janitor (garbage collector) to tidy up for you while Rust hands you a checklist and says, “You’ve got this.” Both methods work, but they have their quirks. Let’s dive into how memory is handled in these two languages and what makes each approach unique."
