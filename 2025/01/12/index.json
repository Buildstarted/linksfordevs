    "Description": "This is the story of a commercially unavailable stereo pair of the\nbi-amped Marshall Uxbridge, with custom-built replacement electronics:\nactive filters feeding two linear power amps. Listening to this\nhigh-fidelity set has brought me immense enjoyment. Play a great album\non these near-fields, and the result is close to pure magic! Over and\nabove the accurate reproduction of a wide audio range, the precision\nand depth of its stereo imaging is stunning."

Matt Mullenweg stopped commenting for a while, though his company had launched WP Engine Tracker — a site for tracking WordPress-driven websites that moved away from WP Engine. I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic — because of a sweetheart deal."
