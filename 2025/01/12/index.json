The community at large seemed not to care about this problem, except\nfor the babashka folks. However, I spent\nlong, hard hours banging my head against\nnative-image\nand it just wasn't working out. It was incredibly painful, and at the end of it,\nI still didn't have standalone, fast-starting native executables. I decided that\nthat was a requirement for my main driving hobby language, and that Clojure didn't\nhave it. It was then that I decided to move on from Clojure."

I think this is a bit gauche, but it seems like fair marketing given everything that’s going on. It should be noted that many sites are leaving for Pressable — owned by Mullenweg’s company, Automattic — because of a sweetheart deal."
