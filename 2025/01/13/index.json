Agan's\nDebugging: The 9 Indispensable Rules for Finding\nEven the Most Elusive Software and Hardware Problems\n(ISBN 0814471684).\nThis book explains the fundamentals of finding and fixing bugs\n(once a bug has been detected), rather than any particular technology.\nIt's best for developers who are novices or who are only moderately\nexperienced, but even old pros will find helpful reminders of things they\nknow they should do but forget in the rush of the moment.\nThis book will help you fix those inevitable bugs,\nparticularly if you're not a pro at debugging.\nIt's hard to bottle experience; this book does a good job.\nThis is a book I expect to find useful many, many, years from now."
