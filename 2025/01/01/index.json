We‚Äôll mostly take the code presented there as a starting point, and optimize it to its limits. For a large part, I‚Äôm simply taking the ‚Äòfuture work‚Äô ideas of that post and implementing them. And then there will be a bunch of looking at assembly code to shave off all the instructions we can. Lastly, there will be one big addition to optimize throughput: batching."
