    "Description": "We still underestimate how much we can squeeze out of large language models simply by giving them more time to think. Consider the lessons from AlphaGo, where progress emerged not from intricate hand-engineered features but from scaling simple methods, applying massive search at inference, and integrating deep reinforcement learning. As the ‚Äúbitter lesson‚Äù in AI suggests, what often matters most is scaling what works. The simple insight here is that deep learning - combined with aligned scaling - tends to outperform more delicate approaches. We don‚Äôt need intricate architectures as much as we need more compute, data, and ways to let the model think longer and integrate well with the environment."
