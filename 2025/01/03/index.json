I checked the query that populated the view, which had various filters but none of them looked suspicious, expect one of them. There was an IFNULL looking at me in the query which smelled awful."

    "Description": "Regularization is a common method for dealing with overfitting in Machine Learning (ML). The simplest and most widely used methods are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge). The L1 and L2 regularizations are well covered in numerous tutorials and books. However, I could not find any good geometric or intuitive explanation of why L1 encourages coefficients to shrink to zero. This post tries to address this."

When is it useful, when is it not, what can be done about it.\nThis could have easily been packaged like a best-selling pop-psychology book â€“ padded to 200 pages with a sampling of the same anecdotes weâ€™ve all read 100 times, fitting a narrative to the life of a celebrity or two to lend credibility, and repeating the same core message a hundred times. Instead it felt like reading a well-organized journal entry. I both respect the author for taking the path less traveled, and love the format for its own sake. I wish more books like this existed. Itâ€™s sort of in a class of its own."

There was a question about how the buffer data layouts work on the GPU, and the speaker didn't have a clear answer. I don't want to come across as criticizing Mason by saying this; rather, I'm saying this kind of low-level information on GPUs is hard to come by because their internals are rarely revealed or discussed."
