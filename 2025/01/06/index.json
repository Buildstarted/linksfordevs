    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Recent advances in data collection technology, accompanied by the ever-rising volume and velocity of streaming data, underscore the vital need for time series analytics. In this regard, time-series anomaly detection has been an important activity, entailing various applications in fields such as cyber security, financial markets, law enforcement, and health care. While traditional literature on anomaly detection is centered on statistical measures, the increasing number of machine learning algorithms in recent years call for a structured, general characterization of the research methods for time-series anomaly detection. This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research."

Behind the scenes, an intricate system of routing and network topologies ensures that everything arrives where it's supposed to—fast and error-free. Let's pull back the curtain and take a closer look at how data navigates the digital highways and the role that topologies play in shaping those pathways."
