In this video, I demonstrate how to take a container image, 'plant based pizza', and run it on AWS using ECS Fargate.\n\nLearn about the advantages of ECS Fargate, the importance of infrastructure as code, and the CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for simplifying deployment. By the end of this video, you'll understand how to set up clusters, define task definitions, and manage networking resources for your containerized web applications on AWS.\n\n00:00 Introduction to Portability\n00:50 Running Containers on AWS\n01:14 Understanding Amazon ECS and Fargate\n02:42 Defining and Deploying Applications on ECS Fargate\n05:31 Using AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code\n10:11 Deploying and Verifying the Application\n12:37 Conclusion and Best Practices\n\nGitHub Repo - https://github.com/jeastham1993/PlantBasedPizza/tree/microservices-module-1"

Built for blazing performance and low-level control, Rust’s unique features make it a standout choice for projects where every millisecond and megabyte count. Let’s dive into why Rust is the Usain Bolt of programming languages and how it stacks up in the performance department."

TL;DR: I wrote a super fast phrase search algorithm using AVX-512 and achieved wins up to 1600x the performance of Meilisearch. The source code can be found here, and here is the crate. The contents of this blog post are inspired by the wonderful idea of Doug Turnbull from the series of blog posts about Roaringish. Here we will take these ideas to an extreme, from smart algorithms to raw performance optimization. I highly recommend reading the Roaringish blog post, but if you don’t want to, there will be a recap on how it works. This project has been almost 7 months in the making, with thousands and thousands of lines of code written and rewritten, so bear with me if I sound crazy. At the moment of writing, there are almost 2.7k LOC, but I have committed around 17k LOC (let’s take a few thousand because of .lock files) (probably at the time of publishing this number has increased), so the project has been rewritten almost 6 times."
