    "Description": "An interesting twist in my recent usage of SQLite was the fact that I noticed my research scripts and the database intertwine more. SQLite is unique in that it really lives in-process, unlike standalone database servers. There is a feature to that which does not get used very frequently, but can be indispensable in some situations. By the way, the talk about the system that made me me to explore SQLite in anger can now be seen here. Normally it is your Ruby (or Python, or Go, or whatever) program which calls SQLite to make it “do stuff”. Most calls will be mapped to a native call like sqlite3_exec() which will do “SQLite things” and return you a result, converted into data structures accessible to your runtime. But there is another possible direction here - SQLite can actually call your code instead."

The contents of this blog post are inspired by the wonderful idea of Doug Turnbull from the series of blog posts about Roaringish. Here we will take these ideas to an extreme, from smart algorithms to raw performance optimization. I highly recommend reading the Roaringish blog post, but if you don’t want to, there will be a recap on how it works. This project has been almost 7 months in the making, with thousands and thousands of lines of code written and rewritten, so bear with me if I sound crazy. At the moment of writing, there are almost 2.7k LOC, but I have committed around 17k LOC (let’s take a few thousand because of .lock files) (probably at the time of publishing this number has increased), so the project has been rewritten almost 6 times."
