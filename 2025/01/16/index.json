Yet at Cerebras, we’ve successfully built and commercialized a chip 50x larger than the largest computer chips – and achieved comparable yields. This seeming paradox is one of our most frequently asked questions: how do we achieve a usable yield with a wafer-scale processor?"

I want to stand at the end of one year and the brink of another and think clearly about how I've been listening, and thus living, and expansively about how I might."

By far the most common example are deprecations, even amongst libraries that claim to follow SemVer."
