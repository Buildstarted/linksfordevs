That moat, seemingly, is due only to the massive and ever-increasing cost of training one of their AI models. Their belief, then, was that they were so far ahead of everyone else and had so much more capital available to them that they could withstand any onslaught and simply outspend the competition. They could therefore justify any capital expenditure as a means to keep the moat filled and sustain their market “leadership”.\nThat’s all changed in the past few weeks."

I also noticed that the low level commands have been wrapped into a more user friendly interfaces (like bastille) making the whole experience more enjoyable."

But before we get to all that, let’s first talk briefly about what model validation is."
