    "Description": "Imagine you’re moving to a new house. You could pack only the essentials and enjoy a stress-free move, or you could drag everything you own—grandma’s old lamp, that broken treadmill, and a box labeled “random cables.” This analogy of moving to query projection makes the concept familiar and relevant. Moving with all that clutter? Nightmare. The same applies to your EF Core queries. Why fetch every column in a table when all you need is a handful of them? That’s where query projection comes in. It’s all about keeping your data lean, clean, and most importantly, efficient. Embracing query projection is like optimizing your coding practices for maximum efficiency."

Even when Mac OS X was still young, and third-party apps had a personal, playful character that made them so much fun—unlike the dull, flat designs we have today—Delicious Library still stood out."
