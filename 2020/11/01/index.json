The task set should be as small as possible yet reflect as many typical (or fundamental or representative) challenges in GUI programming as possible. Each task should be as simple and self-contained as possible yet not too artificial. Preferably, a task should be based on existing examples as that gives the task more justification to be useful and there already will be at least one reference implementation."

Nobody was sure where they came from. These are what came to be known as the ghost characters (幽霊文字)."
