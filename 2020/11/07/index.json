However, the next step in your learning process is to learn how to run Node.js JavaScript locally on your machine. What better way to run your code than inside the most popular editor in Web Development, VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nIn this video, we'll explore two different ways to run Node.js in VS Code. We'll run the node command in the terminal manually. Then, we'll look at the Quokka extension in VS Code to make the process even simpler.\n \n_____________________________________________\n\nNewsletter üóû\nInterested in exclusive content and discounts? ü§Ø Sign up for the newsletter!\nhttps://www.jamesqquick.com\n_____________________________________________\n\nConnect with me üòÄ\nLive streams on Twitch - https://twitch.tv/jamesqquick\nFollow me on Twitter - https://www.twitter.com/jamesqquick\nJoin the üí¨ Discord Server üí¨ - https://discord.gg/vM2bagU\n_____________________________________________\n\nCOURSES  üíª\nLearn how to build Fullstack apps with React and Serverless Functions - https://www.jamesqquick.com/courses/react-and-serverless-fullstack-developmnent\nLearn everything you need to know about Visual Studio Code - https://www.udemy.com/learn-visual-studio-code/\nBuild a Quiz App  - https://www.udemy.com/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/"

    "Description": "I think GraphQL will change the world. There will be a future where you can query any system in the world using GraphQL. I'm building this future. So why would I argue against using GraphQL? My personal pet peeve is when the community keeps advertising benefits of GraphQL that are very generic and really have nothing to do with GraphQL. If we want to drive adoption, we should be honest and take off the rose-tinted glasses. This post is a response to \"Why use GraphQL\" by Kyle Schrade (https://www.apollographql.com/blog/why-use-graphql/). It‚Äôs not meant to be direct criticism. The article is just an excellent base to work with as it represents opinions I keep hearing a lot in the community. If you read the whole article, it‚Äôll take some time, you‚Äôll fully understand why I think Kyle‚Äôs article should be named ‚ÄúWhy use Apollo‚Äù."
