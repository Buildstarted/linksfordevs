When you get into messaging, you will often find code that needs to save state to your database, and then publish an message/event to a message broker.  Unfortunately because they are two different resources, you need a distributed transaction to make these atomic.  There is another option to use the Outbox Pattern which does not require a distributed transaction and most messaging libraries support it.\n\n🔔 Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RKA4vunFAfrfxiJhPEplw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n0:00 Distributed Transaction\n2:21 Outbox Pattern\n3:53 Code Example\n5:36 Demo\n7:39 Publishing At Least Once\n\nCodeOpinon: https://codeopinion.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/codeopinion\n\n#softwarearchitecture #microservices #messagequeue"
