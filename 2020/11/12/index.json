They are based on my own experience as an independent contractor (computer programmer), what I've seen being married to an owner (with a partner) of a small retail shop, and what I've seen and heard talking to multiple small business owners of various kinds in the last twenty years.  Some of them are successful, some of them were not, and some were successful but didn't like it, and stopped.  The recurring thing I've seen (and my own lived experience) is that owning and running your own business is not what most people think it is like, so perhaps this will be useful to you as you set out on a different path."
