    "Description": "We've covered the basics of the C# language, but have not yet gotten any practical advice on object design and interaction.  In this episode, Fritz talks about the SOLID design principles and applying them to C# classes and interfaces.  We conclude with a quick discussion of Dependency Injection and the ASP.NET Core dependency injection container.\n\nInteractive Notebook with samples you can run IN BROWSER at:  https://aka.ms/csharpfritz_notebooks_2020\n\nAfter the C# basics sessions are completed, which user interface framework do you want Fritz to walk through FIRST?  Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13\n\nQuestions:\n0:23:25 - The nice thing about SOLID, the principles are applicable to any technology\n0:53:14 - Composition is better than Inheritance\n0:57:07 - At what point does DI become overengineered?\n1:15:52 - How is the object lifetime affected if we use Dependency Injection?\n1:35:51 - What about using \"using statements\" vs Dependency Injection?\n\nBackground Music is Harris Heller's Streambeats - Synthwave playlist, available royalty free at https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2gjWL0J5SQKceERGJ8Lb5e?si=hxqRoh0DSGei8eOu2vEsiA\n\nSource code and interactive content from the stream are available at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz\nWatch live Mondays at 1300 UTC / 9a ET / 6a PT at:  https://twitch.tv/visualstudio"
