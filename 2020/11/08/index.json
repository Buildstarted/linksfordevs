Also, head to http://squarespace.com/diyperks to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain using offer code PERKS\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this crazy build! It's been a wild journey trying to get this video released - firstly with the delays caused by the ideas that didn't work, and then ultimately by a HARD DRIVE FAILURE! Literally ALL the footage in this video was lost, and it was only thanks to some great data recovery fellows that you're seeing this at all. Backup system implemented¬†now, fyi¬†;) because of these delays, this is actually quite an old video now (like 1 year) but I'm glad it's able to see the light of day as I think the final result is SUPER COOL! In hind sight I may not have started this project of perseverance, but it taught me such a lot in terms of which projects to make to show you guys and how experimental I can¬† ultimately risk being. I know that basically none of you will make this, but the methodology ultimately settled upon is interesting and might have many more use cases. Either way it makes for interesting watching, so I hope you all enjoy it! ~Matt"
