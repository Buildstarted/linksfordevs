Next we will take a deep dive into building API‚Äôs and gPRC services in .NET that can be called from all platforms. Including developing API‚Äôs that can be tested on the local development box with the application running in Azure. And finally we will dive into some of the new capabilities in .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 to make your web services into single file executables that are both small and easy to host. Each section will cover a topic and then have exercises you can go through on your own computer.  When your done you should understand how to build API‚Äôs and services, host them in the variety of options that Azure provides and build small and performant API‚Äôs."
