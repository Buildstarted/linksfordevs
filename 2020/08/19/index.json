That will make it so HA gets the last state from the door sensor after a reboot. \n#2 - pick an unused GPIO pin on the Sonoff SV and set it as \"Relay2\".  Use D4 or D5, not D1 or D3. That should stop the reed switch from triggering the relay.  I haven't had to do this, but I think it may be because I'm using an older version of Tasmota. \n#3 - in the Tasmota Console type \"Powerretain 1\". That will stop the relay from randomly triggering when the Sonoff disconnects and reconnects to the MQTT broker. \n\nI know I went kinda fast in this one.  Everything you need is here. \n\nTo Smarten up your garage doors you’ll need:\nSonoff SV https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-sv.html\nReed Switch http://a.co/6qMTS35\nUSB cord and wall plug or some other power adapter\nJumper wires http://a.co/0htfCkL\nSoap dish https://www.walmart.com/ip/iGo-Travel-Soap-Holder/13814222\nThere is soldering involved. No way around it on this one \nGarage SV setup\nOpen sonoff.ino\nSet a project name and your Wifi and MQTT info in user_config.h\nUpload Tasmota\nFind the IP address of your new Tasmotized Sonoff (you can look in your router)\nPut the Sonoff IP address in your browser, go to Configuration Configure Module and and change the Module Type to Sonoff SV. Save and it’ll restart. \nGo back into Configure Module and set GPIO 14 to Switch2 save and it’ll restart again\nClick Console and type: switchmode1 0 and then switchmode2 2, restart one more time\nNow we’ve got some work to do in Home Assistant\nOpen configuration.yaml\nMake a heading called “cover:” and paste these lines\n\ncover:\n  - platform: mqtt\n    name: \"test\"\n    state_topic: \"cmnd/2/POWER2\"\n    command_topic: \"cmnd/sonoffSV04/POWER\"\n    payload_open: \"ON\"\n    payload_close: \"ON\"\n    payload_stop: \"ON\"\n    state_open: \"ON\"\n    state_closed: \"OFF\"\n    optomistic: false\n    retain: false\nUnder Customize: set the device class and give it a friendly name\n    cover.test:\n      device_class: garage\n      friendly_name: Justin Garage\n\nIf you want to make a card that says Garage Doors instead of Cover then open your groups.yaml.  If you don’t have one just create and new empty file with that name and past these lines. \n\n    garage_doors:\n      name: Garage Doors\n      view: no\n      control: hidden\n      icon: mdi:garage\n      entities:\n        - cover.test\n\nSave both config and groups. In Home Assistant UI check the config and restart. \nNow go to the Automation editor, make a new automation. The trigger is the MQTT topic that fires whenever the relay is turned ON. The action is to turn it back off after one second. Save and reload Automations. \nNow the hardware setup:\nTo isolate the power to the ESP chip from what’s being switched by the relay, use a small screwdriver to pop the 2 resistors. \nSolder 2 lengths of small wire, one on the Input + and one on the output +, these wires will connect to the switch contacts on your garage door motor. \nConnect female end of jumper wires to GPIO 14 and Ground. These are going to the reed switch and will tell you if the garage is open or closed. \nUse a USB cable for power. The red wire is + and the uncovered wire and the outer metal sheath are negative. \nConnect those to female jumpers and plug them into + and - for the ESP chip. \nTest:\nLay it out. Connect the reed switch, power up the board, and open Home Assistant. \nMove the magnet to test the reed switch \nClick the open/close buttons to check the relay. \nIf it all works it’s time to install\nInstall:\nI put mine up near the garage motor. You don’t have to do it this way. \nMount the reed switch. I put mine on the track and the magnet on the top of the door.  Took a few tries to find something that would keep them connected. There’s a lot of motion on that track. \nFind the contacts for your open/close button. Connect the wire from the input side of the relay to one contact, and the wire from the output side to the other. \nOn my garage door those wires are 12v.\nConnect the +/- jumpers from the USB cord, for power to the ESP, and plug it in. \nYou’re done!"
