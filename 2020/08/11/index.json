The problems in those days were quite evident; Linus, it was\nbeing said, did not scale.  But, according to Larry,\na complete burnout was not inevitable.  If Linus could be given the right\ntools, many of his problems (and the frustrations of other kernel\ndevelopers) could be solved, and the system would run smoothly again.  The\nright tool, according to Larry, was a thing called BitKeeper; if some sort\nof agreement could be made on licensing, Larry (along with his company, BitMover)\nwas willing to make \nBitKeeper available for kernel development.  In fact, Larry wanted to see\nBitKeeper used for all free software development; see this article from the \nMarch 25, 1999 LWN Weekly Edition for a view of how things looked at\nthat time."
