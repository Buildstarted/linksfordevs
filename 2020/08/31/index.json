    "Description": "Good software engineers are rare. There are many reasons as to why. The most obvious reason is that to become a good software developer one has to master many skills (language proficiency, documentation literacy, debugging, text editing, architecture, and design, etc, etc). Because these are the obvious barriers to becoming good, there is an abundance of advice out there for young engineers on how to hone their skills. Most of this advice is either uninteresting, inefficient, or both. Why? Because the process of mastering a skill is typically independent of the skill being mastered. The process is almost always as simple as: learn (read technical material), practice (daily), have patience."
