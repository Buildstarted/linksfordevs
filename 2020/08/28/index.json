Additionally, there must be some aspect of your project online and playable, preferably embeddable but at least a downloadable demo we can direct people to. This might be on Steam, Itch.io, or another marketplace.\n\nAll games and game-like things are welcome. The Leftfield is there to showcase everything from small hobby projects and interactive things, to interesting and beautiful commercial work.\n\nThere's a much longer FAQ here (much of which won't apply to an online only event): https://ympt.co.uk/leftfield-collection-faq/\n\nIf you have any questions not included in that, discuss with david.hayward@gamer-network.net\n\nSound good? In that case, we'd like to know this stuff please:"

So what about a forum client, do they take that down just because there is a forum somewhere on the internet posting hate speech?\n\nThis is particularly worrisome because for most people Google Play is the only way they understand to install apps at all.\n\nPicture attached of one of the notices received by fedilab.\n\nhttps://toot.fedilab.app/@fedilab/104761140268193772\n\nhttps://mastodon.social/@Gargron/104763960269049818\n\n@fedilab @tateisu #fediverse #mastoadmin #freespeech #censorship"
