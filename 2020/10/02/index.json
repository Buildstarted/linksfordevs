Enter a line of Bash starting with a `#` comment, then run `!:q` on the next line to see what that would be with proper Bash escaping applied.\n\n```\nbash-3.2$ # This string 'has single' \"and double\" quotes and a $\nbash-3.2$ !:q\n'# This string '''has single''' \"and double\" quotes and a $'\nbash: # This string 'has single' \"and double\" quotes and a $: command not found\n```\nHow does this work? [James Coglan explains](https://twitter.com/mountain_ghosts/status/1311767073933099010):\n\n> The `!` character begins a history expansion; `!string` produces the last command beginning with `string`, and `:q` is a modifier that quotes the result; so I'm guessing this is equivalent to `!string` where `string` is `\"\"`, so it produces the most recent command, just like `!!` does"
