At Ladder, our big bet is using <a href=\"https://clojure.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Clojure</a> for fullstack app development. Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>\n"
