Much like micro-services architectures do for services, micro-frontend architectures break up web applications into small, functional, and scalable components. Micro-frontend approaches can help you avoid creating spaghetti code, improve code structures, and avoid coupling between components. They can also help teams work on front-end code more efficiently. There are four primary ways you can implement micro-frontend architectures with Blazor, and let’s take a closer look at each."
