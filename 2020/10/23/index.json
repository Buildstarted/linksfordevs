    "Description": "Today I'd like to share an idea. It's a very simple idea. It's not fancy and it's certainly not new. In fact, I'm sure many of you have thought about it already. But if you haven't—and even if you have!—I hope you'll take a few minutes to enjoy it with me. Here's the idea: Every matrix corresponds to a graph. So simple! But we can get a lot of mileage out of it.To start, I'll be a little more precise: every matrix corresponds to a weighted bipartite graph. By \"graph\" I mean a collection of vertices (dots) and edges; by \"bipartite\" I mean that the dots come in two different types/colors; by \"weighted\" I mean each edge is labeled with a number."
