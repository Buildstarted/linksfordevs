You can do stupid things to impress other people, or at least to get their attention. This can be something like throwing yourself into a pool around other people without a change of clothes, or something much more dangerous. Regardless, you do it mainly for others. Another stupid action is caused by what I like to call “group inertia”. Everyone in the group thinks it’s a unwise course of action, but no one speaks up about it. An object in motion (in this case, a group of people) likes to stay in motion. Group related unwise desicions are always worth avoiding, they are never fruitful. I think a good example of this is adults and alchohol. As a group drinks itself into heavy intoxication, no one can stop the motion."
