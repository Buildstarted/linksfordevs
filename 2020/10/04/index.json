I sometimes tell my colleagues about a student project I did in my junior year of university, and it’s so well-received that I’m writing this post. 1\nNow, let me ask you a question. Have you ever designed your own ISA, built a processor of that ISA on FPGA, and built a compiler for it? Furthermore, have you run an operating system on that processor?"

Most of the time, completing a task does not require any inventiveness. Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking that we are more than a craftsmen, engineers even, and in order to verify our bias, we try to be clever where no inventiveness is required. This only complicates things, both in the moment and the future."

In France, the 2017 presidential election saw the fall of the major parties (LR and PS) and the rise of the nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen and a newly-born unaffiliated movement created by Emmanuel Macron: La République en Marche, and, in late 2018, the Yellow Vests protests broke out and outlasted even the protest of May 1968."

From Swartz's help in the development of the basic internet protocol RSS to his co-founding of Reddit, his fingerprints are all over the internet. But it was Swartz's groundbreaking work in social justice and political organizing combined with his aggressive approach to information access that ensnared him in a two-year legal nightmare. It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity.\n\nFilm by Brian Knappenberger - Luminant Media\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License"
