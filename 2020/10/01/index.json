Despite this, many model implementations scattered about Github are difficult to follow and hard to recreate locally.  But what should a good model look like? I would propose that the gold standard for a model implemented on Github could be:   The dependencies may be installed automatically, using a single command.  I can build the model in a sandbox without polluting with my dev."

    "Description": "As developers, we make a lot of assumptions about the world. We have to. The world is messy, unorganized, unsorted, and chaotic, and so is the data that this world generates. It's nigh impossible to process data in an orderly fashion if you can't organize it and make meaningful distinctions between different categories. Consider how much more difficult it would be for a music service to recommend titles if we didn't group music into genres, or how utterly meaningless it would be to say that COVID case counts were rising or falling if you couldn't say where or when. Developers are one of many groups of people who's job is largely to categorize and process data. We employ different methods than other disciplines, but the principle is the same. The problem is that almost any attempt to categorize the real world is fraught with peril. The world doesn't fit nicely into groups. It feeds back into itself in knotted and tangled ways. Few natural categories exist, and this means that in order for us to categorize the world, we need to construct those categories ourselves. These categories are build on assumptions about the world, but they're only assumptions. They can and will be broken, and when our assumptions no longer hold, they cause bugs."
