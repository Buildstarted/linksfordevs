In addition to helping you clearly define your goals in advance and encouraging you to write as little code as possible, I love the documenting nature of tests. If your project is well tested, you don’t need documentation (at least for other developers) — they can simply look at the tests and observe the enforced behavior of the code."

In theory, a low priority alert is one that an oncall engineer looks at when there’s no high priority alerts to take care of, and resolves their root cause via some kind of change."

Regardless, there are constraints of CPU and memory that you will likley need to look at to determine the right number of worker threads per hangfire server.  You can scale out further by deploying many hangfire servers on different underlying hosts.
