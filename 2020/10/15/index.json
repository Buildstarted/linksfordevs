While it‚Äôs complimentary to git, gh squashes a bunch of otherwise confusing checkout and pull commands and makes the interface much cleaner.\nIt‚Äôs a slick experience that I‚Äôm sure will continue to see growth, and at some point gh commands will start making an appearance on GitHub docs and eventually on the main site, for example in the ‚Äúclone or download‚Äù tab on a repo, the default could be gh clone org/repo instead of using git over SSH."

Like async in general, cancellation took some time to propagate everywhere - socket operations only started honoring cancellation token in .NET Core 3.0. For the upcoming 5.0 release of Npgsql, the PostgreSQL database driver, a lot of work is going on to provide a good command cancellation story (thanks @vonzshik!!), and it is far more complicated than you‚Äôd think."

    "Description": "Minimal March continues with Fritz working with .NET Core and C# on a Chromebook.  Today he's talking about how he bricked and rebuilt the Chromebook after the last episode.  We build some scripts to automate builds and tests for the project, and Fritz even installs Visual Studio Code on the Chromebook and shows how easy it is to get productive with minimal hardware.\n\nQuestions:\n12:17 - There were incidents where fonts were used to inject viruses into operating systems. Maybe that is why they are protecting it a bit.\n 23:23 - If you're trying to see if it's for you, spending 1000$ instead of 50$ isn't reasonable, especially if you don't have 1000$.\n23:44 - When I teach people I try to ease the environment burden as much as possible. \n24:39 - Make it easy for newcomers to fall into the pit of success.\n24:51 - I really wish Apple would open their ecosystem. I'd love to write something for an iPhone without having a mac.\n1:08:48 - Have you considered the pi4 4gb?\n1:10:40 - What are good resources you might suggest for learning about keeping things consistent and synchronized in a space where multiple instances of the web application are running and you might post to a different server than you got from?\n1:16:00 - The customer reserves a specific unit, but if the eventual consistency then it might already be reserved?\n1:22:36 - Which Linux distribution would you recommend for developing ASP.NET CORE projects?\n1:55:50 - What is Omnisharp?\n\nSource Code at https://github.com/FritzAndFriends/BlazorWebFormsComponents\nBroadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/csharpfritz"

Sometimes, you need a robot.\n\nSteve Giralt is a ‚Äúvisual engineer.‚Äù Check out his Instagram for more:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stevegiralt/?hl=en\n\nOr explore his website as he starts working on educational content about his work:\nhttps://www.thegaragelearning.com/\n\nGiralt began his career as a stills photographer, but he saw potential for more thanks to his hobbies in engineering. A new discipline was born: visual engineering, using robotics, advanced camerawork, and a lot of creativity to create moving images that have never been seen before. His Smores have lit up Times Square, and, in the video above, you can watch how he uses trial and error (and more than a few robots) to drop the perfect lime.\n\nGiralt‚Äôs toolkit includes Arduino programming, Maya, welding, epoxies, super-expensive cameras that can shoot incredible slow motion, and a lot of elbow grease and ingenuity. This form of commercial art shows how technology can make incredible images happen ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt always need computer graphics to do it.\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
