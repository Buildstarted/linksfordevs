    "Description": "If you're a full-time employee, becoming a contractor means giving up some job security. You may not have a guaranteed paycheck for a while, if ever. Being a contractor, especially if you're starting out and doing it alone, brings many uncertainties. However working as a full-time employee carries its own sort of risks. Job security isn't what it used to be, spending time on bureaucracy and pleasing your superiors may not make you fulfilled, and there's a real limit to how much you can accomplish for yourself as part of a larger organization.  There is comfort in working at a company; all you have to do is show up and be told what to do, you don't have to think much about taxes or contracts, someone else can make a lot of the decisions about how to run the company. But if you want to take on more responsibility, have the opportunity to grow and learn to run your own business, and do things your way then consider becoming a contractor. Almost everyone I know who works for a company of any size will be happy to tell you all about the mistakes and boneheaded ideas of their superiors. Everyone has ideas of how the company they work for could be run better. I say if you really believe this then work for yourself."
