His favorite topics are performance and micro-optimizations, he is the maintainer of BenchmarkDotNet (a powerful .NET library for benchmarking supported by the .NET Foundation), and author of Pro .NET Benchmarking. Andrey is a frequent speaker at various events for developers, and he is the program director of the DotNext conference. Andrey is also a PhD in computer science, a Microsoft .NET MVP, a silver medalist of ACM ICPC. In his free time, he likes to study science (his primary research interests are mathematical biology and bifurcation theory). Previously, he worked as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Weizmann Institute of Science and as a research scientist in the Sobolev Institute of Mathematics SB RAS.\n\nPerformance testing allows you to control the performance of your applications automatically. Unfortunately, there is no reliable, well-known approach to do it. In this talk, we will talk about different techniques which can help to transform your benchmarks to performance tests, set up performance monitoring of your test suite, prepare performance agents, and resolve the most critical problems that will stand in your way."
