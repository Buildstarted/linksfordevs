    "Description": "This video shows an affordable way to add USB support to maker projects.\n$2 for 10 PCBs (Any Color): https://jlcpcb.com (sponsor)\n\nThe CH559 is a 8051 architecture based microcontroller that has built in dual USB Hosts. This allows to interface generic Keyboards, Mice, MIDI devices and in my case gamepads. I added this chip as an add on to my ESP32 based game console to replace the SNES controllers by cheap generic ones. The communications is handled over UART which can be done by both ends in hardware. There still is some work to do but you can try it out already. Have fun!\n\nCH559 firmware sources & compiler:\nhttps://github.com/atc1441/CH559sdccUSBHost\nAarons video:\nhttps://youtu.be/Th88RiSmj2w\nLinks to my game using the USB:\nhttps://github.com/bitluni/GameWing2USB\nCH559:\nhttps://link.bitluni.net/ch559\n\nLinks to the parts (affiliate links):\nUSB SNES Gamepad ($2.70 shipped):\nUSB Fake PS3 Controller ($3.30 shipped):\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/usbPs3\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/usbSnes\nSet of Tweezers ($3):\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/tweezers\nFlux ($3 for two):\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/flux\nUltrasonic Cleaner(~$50):\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/cleaner\nSoldering Mat ($9):\nhttps://aliexpress.bitluni.net/mat\n\nMy camera and lens (4k 60fps):\nhttps://amazon.bitluni.net/gh5\n\nplz share :-)\n\nCheck out my Tindie store to get some of my creations:\nhttps://www.tindie.com/stores/bitluni\n\nConsider supporting my lab for some extras and frequent updates:\nhttps://github.com/sponsors/bitluni\nhttps://www.patreon.com/bitluni\nhttps://paypal.me/bitluni\n\nTwitter: @bitluni\nreddit: u/bitluni\n\n#electronics #diy #maker"
