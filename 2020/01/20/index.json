    "Description": "There was recently a thread by David Whitney about inclusion and representation in the .NET community. I suggest you read it as it gives you an idea of the diversity of thought within the .NET community. The thread spoke to me, as an Arabic developer who contributes to the ecosystem through blogging, OSS, and interaction. This particular post is about Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional (MVP) program - what it is, the flaws, and how as a community we can build a better and more inclusive program. And full disclosure, I used to be an MVP."
