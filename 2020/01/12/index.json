    "Description": "I was studying the C# language one day and thought back to earlier in my career. Back then I was learning the assembly language for a little 8 bit Hitachi CPU (the 6303) in order to control a small thermal printer. With the right control codes you could get the printer to display a custom message on the LCD. Then I was walking by the HP Laser printer in the office and wondered if I could do the same here. Once I uncovered the Printer Job Language Reference from HP, I realized this could be fun. After all, who would not get a kick out of a printer with the message “TOUCH ME” on the LCD?"

    "Description": "Nothing can be more frustrating than going into a situation “thinking” you know how a framework works, only to spend the next several hours pulling your hair out and stewing in a pot of unhealthy feelings. I like to consider myself an ASP.NET routing expert with my experience dating back to MVC 1.0. Recently, I’ve started using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages mixed in with MVC and API approaches. I find the combination of all this technology to be a winning one, but it can also add complexity when building views. In this post, I’ll show you a simple one page Razor Page that can help diagnose route resolution issues quickly. Quickly see what your ASP.NET Core application sees and what it requires to resolve routes."
