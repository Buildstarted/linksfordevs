    "Description": "All right, if you can all take your\nseats, we'll get this\nshow on the road.\nAll right. So welcome to Real World\nCrypto 2020,\nthe now largest IACR\nevent focused\non applied cryptography and trying\nto get academics and practitioners\nin the same room to talk about the\nlatest and greatest in\napplied cryptography.\nSo I'm the general chair.\nMy name's Tom Ristenpart.\nSo if you have any problems, I guess\nyou can complain to other people,\nbut you can, of course, also come\ntalk to me.\nJust some quick logistic stuff and\nthen I'll hand it off to Agelos, the\nprogram chair, to talk about the\nprogram.\nVery briefly you're in this big\nroom, the auditorium.\nAnd you came in through the doors.\nThere's restrooms over my right,\nyour left.\nAnd there's more food and\nbreak space and might get crowded\nduring lunch. There's a whole nother\nroom downstairs if you kind of go\nthat way. Turn right outside the\ndoors here.\nYou'll see that.\nAnd also, if we run out of or run\nlow on seats here, there's a whole\nanother section of seats up above.\nThat you can get to through the\nsecond floor and there's some\nfurther breakout spaces that you're\nwelcome to use.\nFinally, by registering\nand being here at the event,\nyou've agreed to our code of\nconduct. You know, we're committed\nto having inclusive, welcoming\nevent.\nAnd so if unfortunately there's\nany type of issues, please\ndon't hesitate to reach out to\nmyself or the code of conduct\nliaison, Tall Rabine, who is gonna\nbe here for part of the conference\nor any of the other steering\ncommittee members who you can look\nup on the website.\nBut I'm sure we'll have a great\nevent.\nOkay. With that I'll hand it over to\nAgelos.\nOK. Thanks, Tom, and thanks for\nbeing here.\nI'm Agelos.\nThis year's program chair.\nSo just a bit about the stats\nof Real World Crypto 2020.\nWe have 38 talks.\nTwenty seven contributed and twelve\ninvite it.\nTotal number of submissions and that\ncontributed part of the program\nwere 75 and that was a 36\npercent acceptance rate and\nthe breakdown was about 50 percent\nhaving a non-academic affiliation.\nSo almost an even\nsplit.\nSo the classic joke\nhere. Single most important factor\nto get here. Got to work in real\nworld crypto.\nJust how your work submitted.\nSo very important to contribute.\nAnd we thank very much all the\nauthors of contributed\ntalks for sending their work\nfor consideration\nin this year's program.\nSo Real World Crypto welcomes\ngroundbreaking real world research\nthat has been or will be published.\nSo we have no proceedings, but we\nalso strongly encourage contributed\nsubmissions prepared solely for real\nworld crypto.\nAnd so with this like\nstopped thinking about the program\n2021.\nFor this year we\nhave 15 sessions\nwith a great selection of topics.\nPlus the prize\nceremony was going to take place\ntoday just before lunch,\nas well as the talk session,\nwhich will be tomorrow.\nAs Tom mentioned,\nby attending real world crypto,\nyou're a member of IACR for 2021\nunless you selected to opt out.\nAnd for those of you that you're\nnew to IACR, this\nthe International Association of\nChronologic Research runs a number\nof conferences and symposia like\nReal World Crypto in summer schools.\nIf you want to know more about it or\nyou want to get the latest, let's go\nto the website, www dot IACR\ndot org.\nHow many of you?\nHow many people are here today?\nSo we've actually\nhaving the biggest real world crypto\nsince the beginning of the\nconference.\nMore than six hundred forty two\npeople are now at the conference.\nAnd I should say also that many\nof you opted in for being\nmembers of the IACR.\nAnd thank you very much for that.\nBringing actually the IACR\nmembership count to the biggest, the\nbiggest count ever.\nFinal word.\nReal World Crypto 2021.\nIt's gonna be in Amsterdam\nwith Peter Schwab.\nThe local organizers and Tom\nis gonna be the program chair.\nSo the submission deadline\nfor talks is gonna be sometime\nin the fall.\nSo those of you are interested\nin participating, please start\nthinking about how you can\ncontribute.\nSo thank you very much.\nAnd with this, I'll stop.\nThank you all very much for being\nhere. I'm gonna pass it to Kenny\nPatterson, the session chair or our\nfirst program.\nAll right.\nOK.\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nJust to add one word to the introductory\nremarks.\nThis year, you'll notice that we\nhave many, many sponsors who are\nsupporting Real World Crypto.\nI think we have a record number of\nsponsors this year.\nAnd I think we should just give them\nall a quick round of applause and\nI'll explain why.\nSo\nwe use the sponsorship money for two\nthings mainly. One is to provide\nstipends so that students and\nearly career researchers are able to\nattend the conference.\nAnd we've handed out dozens of\nstipends.\nWe will be handing out dozens of\nstipends\nas a result of having that\nsponsorship. And we also use the\nsponsorship to keep the registration\nfee low.\nSo the registration fee this year,\nincluding IACR membership, I think\nwas around 250 dollars.\nIf you go to ACM conference,\nyou might be a thousand dollars.\nAnd here I think even the sandwiches\nare better."

By the time I was in high school, I'd realized that these\nopportunities were better spent getting a head start on homework for other\nclasses, but I did have a few friends who still passed the time playing video\ngames. Rather than Flash games or Quake, though, these were browser games using\nthe new-fangled HTML5 canvas. I'd practically forgotten these games existed\nuntil someone from my capture-the-flag team mentioned \"krunker.io\". Apparently it's one of the more popular ones. It got me thinking about how I'd go about\nwriting cheats for a game in the browser. Writing cheats for CS:GO was a breeze,\nso why would this be any harder? I had some time to spare over winter break, so\nI decided to give it a go and see what kind of damage I could do."
