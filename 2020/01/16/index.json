    "Description": "On Tuesday, the ever-impressive Blazor team announced a new experimental project: Mobile Bindings that allow developers to write Blazor-style syntax that produces Xamarin.Forms UI controls instead of HTML elements, therefore producing native iOS and Android applications.   When we at the Uno Platform noticed that they were using Xamarin.Forms, we immediately saw a fun means to validate and stress-test our Xamarin.Forms renderers for WebAssembly, in order to bring Blazor Native to WebAssembly. Also, a few of you asked about it on Twitter, so we gave it a shot.   Introducing the Blazor-Xamarin.Forms-UWP-Uno-WebAssembly uber-stack! In less than 24hrs we were able to port the ToDo App to WebAssembly:  1. Blazor to Xamarin.Forms  This is the part that the Blazor team announced on Tuesday. Essentially taking a UI defined in Razor syntax (a mix of markup and C# code), processing it, and converting it into a tree of Xamarin.Forms controls.  2. Xamarin.Forms to UWP  Although the Blazor team’s announcement highlighted the ability to produce mobile apps for iOS and Android, Xamarin.Forms also supports Windows as a compilation target, using the UWP framework. The Blazor X.Forms Bindings work perfectly well with UWP.  In this step, Xamarin.Forms converts its visual tree to a tree of UWP view elements.  3. UWP (or WinUI) to Uno Platform  Here’s where Uno comes in. The Uno Platform allows you to build apps for iOS, Android, and the …"
