With migrating to ASP.NET Core 3.1 we need to keep this same functionality where it impacts responses."

    "Description": "Visit our website to learn more! https://conf.dotnetos.org/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dotnetos/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dotnetosorg\n\nShay is a senior software engineering working in Microsoft's data access team, on Entity Framework Core, the .NET database API (ADO.NET) and other stuff. He is also the lead developer of Npgsql, the .NET open source driver for the PostgreSQL database. Shay is interested in all things performance - low-level and otherwise - and works hard to make .NET\nshine in various benchmarks.\n\nDeep dive into an ORM!\n\n.NET ORMs have a particularly complex and thankless job that few people fully understand - to translate user LINQ constructs into SQL; this talk will be a deep dive into Entity Framework's internals which handle this. We'll be discussing IQueryable providers, LINQ expression trees (which can be used to improve perf via code generation), the visitor pattern and the EF's internal architecture, some interesting and non-obvious mismatches between LINQ and SQL and how to overcome them, and some internal as well as user-facing techniques for making EF perform better. We will also focus on some aspects that make the new EF Core different from other ORMs."
