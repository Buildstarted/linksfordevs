    "Description": "In this hat-free episode, Jeff shows off his new hair-color and then the conclusion of the work on the Channel Points pub/sub interface with Twitch.  At 29:30, he introduces the concept of the BlazorWebFormsComponents project, a new ongoing project on the channel. \n\nThese components will emulate the API of the default ASP.NET web forms controls, but in the Blazor framework.  This way, developers can perform small changes to their web forms code and it should work the same in Blazor.\n\n https://github.com/FritzAndFriends/BlazorWebFormsComponents\n\nQuestions\n17:32 - Is C#8 available in .NET Framework 4.8?\n\n Broadcasted live on Twitch -- Watch live at https://www.twitch.tv/csharpfritz"
