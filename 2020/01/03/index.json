    "Description": "Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are teaming up with Big Oil to squeeze more oil and gas out of the ground using machine learning technology.\n\nJoin the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Amazon have been very vocal about their efforts to reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. But as The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo have reported, these same companies are currently teaming up with fossil fuel industry to help them squeeze as much oil and gas out of the ground as possible. \n\nOil has always been hard to find and hard to extract, and so the industry has teetered precariously on the edge of profitability several times over the course of its history. Over and over again, experts have predicted that we'll soon run out of accessible, affordable oil – but so far, they've been wrong. Just when things look bleakest for black gold, new technology swoops in to keep the industry afloat.\n\nOpen Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence.

He’s\nworked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather\ndata, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn’t leak! He’s previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the internals of the .NET Runtime at www.mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Raygun APM Platform (raygun.com/platform/apm) and lives near\nPinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.\n\nWe often take the 'Common Language Runtime' (CLR) for granted and just let it get on with its job. But not only does it run our code, it ensures that it runs as fast as possible. In this talk we'll take a walk through the internals of the .NET Runtime, from a 'performance' perspective. Looking at some of the low-level tricks the .NET Core CLR does to make our code run as fast as possible. Covering Value Types, Method Calls, Tiered Compilation and more."
