    "Description": "Air\nAlone in Kyoto\nin 7/8\n\nThe video is the scene from Lost in Translation which used the original version of Alone in Kyoto in the same way. It was very lightly re-edited to match the changes to the music.\n\nThe remix was made from the released recording--no multitrack, just a stereo file.\n\nI made it on a laptop with bad headphones during the Christmas holidays when I didn't have access to my main computer, but I think it turned out surprisingly well!"
