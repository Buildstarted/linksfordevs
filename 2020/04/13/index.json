Really, it had the awful name \"Assembler Editor.\" I expect some pedantic folks want to interject that an assembler is not a compiler.  At one time I would have made that argument myself.  But there was a very clear divide between editing 6502 code and running it, a divide that took time to cross, when the textual source was converted into machine-runnable form.  Contrast that to Atari BASIC, the only language I knew previously, which didn't feature a human-initiated conversion step and the inevitable time it took."
