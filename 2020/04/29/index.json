    "Description": "Having the ability to call code written in other languages is increasingly important, as there are many very useful libraries that are getting ported over to WebAssembly. In .NET, the common defined way for doing interop is P/Invoke and DllImport, and .NET for WebAssembly has support for it in the form of static linking of LLVM Bitcode object files. In this article, I will walk through how to call some simple C/C++ and Rust code from C# in a WebAssembly app. In the general .NET sense, P/Invoke was built to perform dynamic linking with Windows PE Dlls, but has been extended in mono to allow for static linking. This technique is also used by mono on iOS to call native code, and allows for a single executable package to contain the code to execute the application. This is what is used for the demos in this article. Setting up the C# WebAssembly project First let’s create create a .NET WebAssembly app, using the Uno WebAssembly Bootstrapper. Note that macOS is not yet supported for the static linking scenario, and that on Windows 10 you’ll need to have WSL installed. Create a .NET Standard 2.0 Library in Visual Studio for Windows …"
