    "Description": "There are (at least) two use cases of it:\n - Migrate large number of (hundreds) data pipelines running on ADLA  to Databrick. Those data pipelines usually have heavy business logic built in C# library. It will be a huge cost to re-write the code in Java\n - Most ML applications have online prod environment and offline experiment environment. If the application has parts of its logic built in C# library (e.g. featuring), it will be a big headache if prod environment only allows .net library while the offline experiment does not support it, i.e. having to maintain two code bases."

While you can accomplish amazing feats at build time, a dynamic backend can allow your application features that are not possible at build time. The combination of .NET Core and the static site generator of your choice is a powerful one-two punch. In this post, I’ll show you how to set up an ASP.NET Core application hosting a static site generator, with the added ability to watch all files within your project."
