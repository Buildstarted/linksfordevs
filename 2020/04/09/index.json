Without further ado: x:Bind functions Uno has been supporting some form of x:Bind markup for properties, binding to functions were a big ask from users of Uno, as it allows for invoking methods from code behind very easily. Two of the largest use of x:Bind functions is to reduce the use of converters, and the use of static properties. Another use of the x:Bind is familiar to WPF developers, where binding to multiple properties is also available. You‚Äôll find below some examples of the x:Bind feature. Member Function, to make a string upper case: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind MyProperty.ToUpper()}\" /> Static type fields or properties OneTime binding: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind local:StaticType.PropertyIntValue}\" /> OneWay local member function with multiple observable parameters: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind Multiply(slider1.Value, slider2.Value), Mode=OneWay}\" /> Literal boolean parameters: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind BoolFunc(x:False)}\" /> Literal numeric value: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind Add(InstanceProperty, 42.42)}\" /> Use of system functions such as: <TextBlock Text=\"{x:Bind sys:String.Format('Formatted {0}', ‚Ä¶"
