    "Timestamp": "2020-04-28T08:02:17",
    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Distributed consensus is a fundamental primitive for constructing\nfault-tolerant, strongly-consistent distributed systems. Though many\ndistributed consensus algorithms have been proposed, just two dominate\nproduction systems: Paxos, the traditional, famously subtle, algorithm; and\nRaft, a more recent algorithm positioned as a more understandable alternative\nto Paxos.\n  In this paper, we consider the question of which algorithm, Paxos or Raft, is\nthe better solution to distributed consensus? We analyse both to determine\nexactly how they differ by describing a simplified Paxos algorithm using Raft's\nterminology and pragmatic abstractions.\n  We find that both Paxos and Raft take a very similar approach to distributed\nconsensus, differing only in their approach to leader election. Most notably,\nRaft only allows servers with up-to-date logs to become leaders, whereas Paxos\nallows any server to be leader provided it then updates its log to ensure it is\nup-to-date. Raft's approach is surprisingly efficient given its simplicity as,\nunlike Paxos, it does not require log entries to be exchanged during leader\nelection. We surmise that much of the understandability of Raft comes from the\npaper's clear presentation rather than being fundamental to the underlying\nalgorithm being presented."

This article is all about a tiny MS DOS program called \"Memories\". This program has a size of 256 bytes and won the \"PC 256 byte\" competition of the demoscene event \"Revision\" in 2020, as well as the public choice award. You can watch a video of the output of this program here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imquk_3oFf4) and a video including live reactions of online audience and moderators here (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/589179638?t=7h02m40s). You can download the release and comment here (https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=85227). This wiki article will give you an indepth analysis of the program and point out historical references as well as development steps. In case you did not notice, you are now on the \"sizecoding wiki\". This will help you not only to understand the interior of \"Memories\", but also enable you to produce something like this yourself. Feel free to look around! It is recommended that you start with the basics of this wiki first if you're new to sizecoding and/or x86 assembler. While the principles might be easy to grasp, details of the implementation might not."
