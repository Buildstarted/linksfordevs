In this paper trading on the stock\nexchange is interpreted into a game with a Markov property consisting of\nstates, actions, and rewards. A system for trading the fixed volume of a\nfinancial instrument is proposed and experimentally tested; this is based on\nthe asynchronous advantage actor-critic method with the use of several neural\nnetwork architectures. The application of recurrent layers in this approach is\ninvestigated. The experiments were performed on real anonymized data. The best\narchitecture demonstrated a trading strategy for the RTS Index futures\n(MOEX:RTSI) with a profitability of 66% per annum accounting for commission.\nThe project source code is available via the following link:\nhttp://github.com/evgps/a3c_trading."
