    "Description": "In this paper, we show that attackers can exfiltrate data from air-gapped\ncomputers via Wi-Fi signals. Malware in a compromised air-gapped computer can\ngenerate signals in the Wi-Fi frequency bands. The signals are generated\nthrough the memory buses - no special hardware is required. Sensitive data can\nbe modulated and secretly exfiltrated on top of the signals. We show that\nnearby Wi-Fi capable devices (e.g., smartphones, laptops, IoT devices) can\nintercept these signals, decode them, and send them to the attacker over the\nInternet. To extract the signals, we utilize the physical layer information\nexposed by the Wi-Fi chips. We implement the transmitter and receiver and\ndiscuss design considerations and implementation details. We evaluate this\ncovert channel in terms of bandwidth and distance and present a set of\ncountermeasures. Our evaluation shows that data can be exfiltrated from\nair-gapped computers to nearby Wi-Fi receivers located a distance of several\nmeters away."
