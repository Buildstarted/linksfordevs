You need to support systems with as little as 256K.  That's a quarter megabyte to contain the word processor, the document being edited, and the memory needed by the operating system.

In this talk, we'll cover basics of contributing to open-source and discuss tooling, etiquette, and self-care with the goal of preparing you to start making meaningful contributions to an existing open-source project.\n\nBuild Community-Driven Software Projects on GitHub: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-community-driven-projects-github/?WT.mc_id=SDC-8397-ticyren"
