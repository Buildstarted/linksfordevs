    "Description": "Scott is the Director of Program Management for .NET at Microsoft. When Scott first joined Microsoft back in 2007, he was working on the ASP.NET team. &nbsp; As the Director of Program Management of .NET, Scott and his team build .NET Core, .NET Framework, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, managed languages (C#/F#/VB), as well as the Web and .NET Tooling for Visual Studio. &nbsp; In this episode, Jeffrey and Scott discuss the announcements that were made at the recent .NET Conf 2020, everything .NET 5.0, and general advice for .NET developers. Scott also touches on the Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings project, isolated CSS, browser-based applications, the pre-render server feature in .NET 5.0, and much more. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes. [1:02] About The Azure DevOps Podcast and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:11] Clear Measure is hiring! Be sure to check out the link in the show notes. [1:34] About today’s guest, Scott Hunter! [1:51] Jeffrey welcomes Scott back to the podcast. [1:58] Jeffrey and Scott reflect on software and tech history, their job history, and the history of how they know each other. [7:21] Scott shares his predictions on the technology and software that developers should be investing in that were showcased at .NET Conf 2020. [15:08] The two tracks Microsoft seems to be going on and Scott’s thoughts on what the overall vision seems to be. [19:05] About the Experimental Mobile Blazor Bindings project. [21:58] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [22:31] From a labor pool perspective, there seems to be a mountain more of people who know how to lay out a screen and make something attractive using an HTML and CSS combination. Contracting with a designer who only needs to know HTML and CSS is becoming an increasingly affordable option. Is this part of Scott’s thought process? [25:15] Jeffrey and Scott touch on another cool announcement from .NET Conf 2020: isolated CSS. [26:30] Scott tells a fun story about the merits of being on a .NET team and working at Microsoft. [29:59] There’s one paradigm in browser-based applications that doesn’t exist in desktop or mobile applications: the back button. Scott shares his perspective on this and whether or not they’ll be supported in a first-class way. [32:17] Scott highlights another cool feature in .NET 5: the pre-render server. [33:49] Scott speaks about an amazing customer of theirs that they highlighted at the .NET Conf 2020 keynote. [38:09] Is .NET 5 the fastest real programming platform? What would Scott’s recommendations be to a team looking to move from .NET 4.8 to 5.0?

After around a decade of nearly exclusive C# work, my curiosity was piqued with an uptick in hearing about this other #-lang.  My initial reaction was one I've since seen in other C# developers - dismissal - C# is a good language and I was comfortable with it so why bother with the effort of learning a different one?  But the curiosity remained - and at least a few times I decided I'd set aside an evening to go through a basic introduction post and try to write some katas in F#.  It didn't stick because I just felt lost and couldn't translate my experience with C# into feeling even remotely comfortable with F#.  Easy enough to drop the curly braces, a little bit of a hiccup to remember to let instead of var - but how to do what I wanted?"

    "Description": "It’s always been a bit of a balancing act to decide which games I write about in detail here — a matter of balancing my level of personal interest in each candidate against its historical importance. In the early years of this project especially, when I still saw it as focusing almost exclusively on narrative-oriented games, I passed over some worthy candidates because I considered them somewhat out of scope. And now, needless to say, I regret some of those omissions."
