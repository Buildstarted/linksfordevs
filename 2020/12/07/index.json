We're just Ubuntu or OSX.\n23:12 - No one ever really clarifies whats what secure about it, it's normally just the statement \"it's not secure\".\n23:49 - I wouldn't rule out learning from you, just because of what you use or who you work for. \n24:23 - What do you do at Microsoft?\n59:58 - Are there decorators or something for this kind of boilerplate in C#?\n1:00:30 - Is BlazorWebFormsComponents a Razor Component Library. I would like to use it in my projects if it has controls that I could use?\n1:01:21 - I have been using neovim on st terminal with omnisharp. Vim is extremely fast and snappy. Almost better than vs code but way too far to get close to actual VS.\n1:10:17 - What is the flavor of Linux to which MS most contributes to?\n1:47:32 - Can you install nuget packages from vim?\n1:52:38 - Why do you need attribute [Parameter]? I've never used Blazor.\n1:53:45 - Child content, is that a child safety feature?\n2:14:52 - Are Blazor calculations faster than Javascript code?\n\n\nSource at:  https://github.com/FritzAndFriends/BlazorWebFormsComponents"

    "Description": "We take many environmental factors for granted when it comes to running our .NET applications. Information about the operating system may seem insignificant for folks deploying to rigorously maintained target environments. Still, for folks who publish desktop client software, the luxury of choosing the destination is not an option. This post will be using .NET to determine the operating system and architecture our .NET application is currently running within. We’ll also resolve the SDK version our app is utilizing. Finally, we’ll run our .NET code under three different operating systems to see the results: macOS, Windows, and Linux."

But it’s clearly not what we want… Let’s see how to fix that."
