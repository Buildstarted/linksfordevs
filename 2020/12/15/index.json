    "Description": "Most undergraduate computer sciences courses teach students about tail call\noptimization (TCO), and even if you\ndon't have a formal computer science background the concept is talked about\nenough that you might be familiar with it anyway, especially if you've ever done\nany functional programming. However, I think the way TCO is normally taught is\nvery confusing, because it's normally taught in the context of recursion. It's\ntaught this way because without TCO many recursive functions can blow up the\nstack causing a stack overflow. Therefore by teaching people about TCO in the\ncontext of recursion, you can teach them why optimizing compilers (or\ninterpreters) can run tail recursive code efficiently and without causing a\nstack overflow."

Modern thermal underclothing offers the possibility to turn the thermostat much lower without sacrificing comfort or sex appeal. The potential energy savings are huge; the costs are almost nil.

A prominent theme in the list is economics and economic methodology with A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas, Economic Modelling as Robustness Analysis, and Thoughts on DSGE Macroeconomics. The Theory of Interstellar Trade is an oddball article from a young Paul Krugman. An introduction to (algorithmic) randomness is an excellent invitation to a technical area of mathematical logic, and Comments on Economic Models, Economics, and Economists is a fun and effective book review on methodology. Finally, there’s four thought provoking articles across political rhetoric, machine learning privacy, social contract theory, and international relations with The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Stealing Machine Learning Models via Prediction APIs, Self-organizing moral systems, The End of Grand Strategy.\n\n"
