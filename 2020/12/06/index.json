    "Description": "Deep learning's successes are often attributed to its ability to\nautomatically discover new representations of the data, rather than relying on\nhandcrafted features like other learning methods. We show, however, that deep\nnetworks learned by the standard gradient descent algorithm are in fact\nmathematically approximately equivalent to kernel machines, a learning method\nthat simply memorizes the data and uses it directly for prediction via a\nsimilarity function (the kernel). This greatly enhances the interpretability of\ndeep network weights, by elucidating that they are effectively a superposition\nof the training examples. The network architecture incorporates knowledge of\nthe target function into the kernel. This improved understanding should lead to\nbetter learning algorithms."

    "Description": "Apple caused quite a stir with the announcement of their Pro Display XDR, a High Dynamic Range display that occupies a convoluted space in the market. It seeks to be both a Very Nice Computer Display, and a reference HDR video monitor — but by most measures it’s far too expensive to be the former, and not quite up to the rarified specs of the latter. Confusingly, it also outperforms some HDR displays costing considerably more, by some metrics. It’s currently the only display-only device Apple makes, and it’s simultaneously ludicrously expensive and a too-good-to-be-true deal. Suffice it to say that while there may be very few people for whom the Pro Display XDR is the unquestionably right choice, they know who they are, and they don’t need the internet’s advice about it."
