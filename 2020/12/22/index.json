    "Description": "Though it didn’t garner as much attention as other police reform measures during the special legislative session that ended this fall, a provision to decriminalize jaywalking in a pretextual policing bill from Delegate Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, means that come March 1, police will no longer be able to stop folks for the act of crossing […]"

    "Description": "I’m running through Lands End. It’s 8AM on a winter day. Cool mist hangs in the air, and the gravel crunches under my running shoes. I’m looking at my Apple Watch, checking the time as I run down the hill, past the Cliff House, looking at the Pacific as it shines in the morning sun like a pool of liquid silver stretching to the horizon. California is good. I hear the waves crashing, and the air softly smells of salt and pines. To my left, I see the Pacific Towers: eight fifty-five story glass obelisks stretching into the sky, all connected by a public park up top, six hundred feet in the air. A marvel of modern engineering, only paralleled by a few buildings in Shanghai. The year is 2030. I’m fortunate to rent a one-bedroom in the Pacific Towers for $2700 a month. I live on the fourteenth floor."

    "Description": "As Volta hits its 1.0 release, I’ve been thinking about what makes it more than just a Node version manager. I think what makes Volta so liberating is what I’ve been calling Toolchains as Code (TaC): The exact set of command-line tools used for a project should be in git, and should Just Work for everyone who contributes to the project. Specifying toolchains as code instead of manually installing and upgrading frees developers up from acting like their development machine’s sysadmin, and lets them focus their precious cognitive resources on what really matters: building software!"
