Another solution would be to host an open-source alternative but this comes at the cost of a higher maintenance burden."

    "Description": "In this episode, Jeffrey is joined by Maddy Leger, a Program Manager at Microsoft on the Xamarin team! &nbsp; Maddy has been with the Xamarin team since 2018 working on Xamarin tooling. When she first joined Microsoft and worked with the Xamarin team as an intern, she realized the impact that she could have in creating amazing developer tools and frameworks, which inspired her to pursue a role as Program Manager. You can connect with her on Twitter and GitHub @maddyleger1! &nbsp; In Jeffrey and Maddy’s conversation, they discuss Xamarin in a .NET 5 world. Maddy shares her vision for where Xamarin is headed and what she hopes will be the new normal for C# developers five years from now; what the state-of-the-art is now for Xamarin; what a Xamarin developer setup looks like in the .NET 5 world for mobile, Mac, and Windows; and what developers with existing Xamarin apps should they be paying attention to (or change) with .NET 5 coming out. &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes. [1:07] About The Azure DevOps Podcast and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:20] Clear Measure is hiring! Be sure to check out the link in the show notes. [1:43] About today’s guest, Maddy Leger! [2:17] Jeffrey welcomes Maddy Leger to the podcast. [2:25] Maddy speaks about her career journey thus far and what led to her working on the Xamarin team at Microsoft. [5:20] Overtime, the story for developing on non-Windows computers has been fragmented. Maddy speaks about this and what the story looks like right now. [6:25] Maddy shares her vision for where Xamarin is headed and what she hopes will be the new normal for C# developers five years from now. [7:09] What the state-of-the-art is now for Xamarin. [9:30] If you just want things to work and just have an app to access some data, what level of share code is Xamarin currently? [10:50] Maddy speaks about what a Xamarin developer setup looks like in the .NET 5 world for mobile. [13:38] A word from Azure DevOps Podcast’s sponsor: Clear Measure. [14:25] Maddy speaks on the Mac story as a Xamarin developer and when you need to have a Mac on the .NET 5 side. [18:06] For developers now, do they need a Mac of some type? Or does the iPhone suffice? [19:07] Azure DevOps has hosted Mac Agents. If you’re using that, do you need a local Mac? [20:35] In the .NET 5 world, what is state-of-the-art when it comes to the teams’ development, DevOps environment, building, testing, packaging, and deploying? What should they choose? And what pieces do they put together? [22:30] What are the libraries and tools for automated testing and testing locally? What does that look like these days? [24:15] What do deployments to a DevOps environment look like in the world of .NET 5 in Xamarin? [27:04] For developers with existing Xamarin apps that they’ve been managing, what should they be paying attention to or change with .NET 5 coming out? What would they miss out on if they don’t move to .NET 5? [29:01] Jeffrey thanks Maddy for joining the podcast! &nbsp; Mentioned in this Episode:   (Sponsor)  — Available on Amazon!  — Click here to download the .NET DevOps for Azure ebook!   — Follow to stay informed about future events!         &nbsp; Want to Learn More?

    "Description": "DNA from low-biodiversity fracture water collected at 2.8-kilometer depth in a South African gold mine was sequenced and assembled into a single, complete genome. This bacterium, Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator , composes >99.9% of the microorganisms inhabiting the fluid phase of this particular fracture. Its genome indicates a motile, sporulating, sulfate-reducing, chemoautotrophic thermophile that can fix its own nitrogen and carbon by using machinery shared with archaea. Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator is capable of an independent life-style well suited to long-term isolation from the photosphere deep within Earth's crust and offers an example of a natural ecosystem that appears to have its biological component entirely encoded within a single genome."

    "Description": "Almost exactly twenty years ago I started writing a short article about the problems with string theory.  I had been thinking about doing this for quite a while, and the timing of entering the twenty-first century seemed appropriate for evaluating something that had long been advertised as “a piece of 21st-century physics that had fallen by accident into the 20th”.  The piece was done in a week or two, after which I sent it around to a group of physicists to ask for comments.  The reaction was mostly positive, although at least one well-known theorist told me that publicly challenging string theorists in this way would be counter-productive."
