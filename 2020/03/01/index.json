It's really 4/3 œÄ r^3.   Cliff also says that using a tube to break the vapor lock is challenging.  Straws (even flexo-straws) kink when bent around narrow hairpin curves.  And most flexible tubes (especiallly aquarium air tubing) have high friction against glass, so they're difficult to thread along the curve. \n\nNumberphile is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI): http://bit.ly/MSRINumberphile\n\nWe are also supported by Science Sandbox, a Simons Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process of science. https://www.simonsfoundation.org/outreach/science-sandbox/\n\nAnd support from Math For America - https://www.mathforamerica.org/\n\nNUMBERPHILE\nWebsite: http://www.numberphile.com/\nNumberphile on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/numberphile\nNumberphile tweets: https://twitter.com/numberphile\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Numberphile_Sub\n\nVideos by Brady Haran\nAnimation by Pete McPartlan\n\nPatreon: http://www.patreon.com/numberphile\n\nNumberphile T-Shirts and Merch: https://teespring.com/stores/numberphile\n\nBrady's videos subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/BradyHaran/\n\nBrady's latest videos across all channels: http://www.bradyharanblog.com/\n\nSign up for (occasional) emails: http://eepurl.com/YdjL9"

    "Description": "This paper characterizes the first protein to be discovered in a meteorite.\nAmino acid polymers previously observed in Acfer 086 and Allende meteorites\n[1,2] have been further characterized in Acfer 086 via high precision MALDI\nmass spectrometry to reveal a principal unified structure of molecular weight\n2320 Daltons that involves chains of glycine and hydroxy-glycine residues\nterminated by iron atoms, with additional oxygen and lithium atoms.\nSignal-to-noise ratios up to 135 have allowed the quantification of iron and\nlithium in the various MALDI fragments via the isotope satellites due to their\nrespective minority isotopic masses 54Fe and 6Li. Analysis of the complete\nspectrum of isotopes associated with each molecular fragment shows 2H\nenhancements above terrestrial averaging 25,700 parts per thousand (sigma =\n3,500, n=15), confirming extra-terrestrial origin and hence the existence of\nthis molecule within the asteroid parent body of the CV3 meteorite class. The\nmolecule is tipped by an iron-oxygen-iron grouping that in other terrestrial\ncontexts has been proposed to be capable of absorbing photons and splitting\nwater into hydroxyl and hydrogen moieties."
