    "Description": "OpenBSD aims to be a secure operating system. In the past few months there were quite a few security errata, however. That’s not too unusual, but some of the recent ones were a bit special. One might even say bad. The OpenBSD approach to security has a few aspects, two of which might be avoiding errors and minimizing the risk of mistakes. Other people have other ideas about how to build secure systems. I think it’s worth examining whether the OpenBSD approach works, or if this is evidence that it’s doomed to failure."

    "Description": "One of the many advantages of using a tool like Entity Framework Core is, that you are sure that the framework will generate properly parameterized SQL for you. This helps avoid SQL injection issues and avoids plan cache pollution. Unfortunately, EF Core currently falls short on that promise, when translating queries, where you supply a list of values to be matched against a column - Enumerable.Contains method - this is translated to a SQL Server IN operator"
