I often get questions from developers why they should invest time into learning a completely new domain, and why companies shouldn’t just hire “real” Data Scientists. I wanted to take a moment to write down why I think developers in the .NET community should take an interest, a leap of faith if you will, and venture in the world of machine learning.  "
