Don't forget, this is Excel! However, on my fairly old PC it updates once every 2 seconds, so isn't too bad considering!\n\nThe model can be found here: https://github.com/s0lly/Raytracer-In-Excel\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThis model was inspired by \"The Ray Tracer Challenge\" book by Jamis Buck - a brilliant read! Not all the features of that book are included, of course - Excel can only handle so much!!\n\nMusic by Eric Skiff, song \"All of Us\" for the intro and \"09 Come and Find Me - B mix\" for the main sequence.
