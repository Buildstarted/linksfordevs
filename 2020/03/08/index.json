    "Description": "I've hit a big milestone in my CPU Build, the core of the processor is complete. There will be a few refinements as I convert more of it over to PCB's but the underlying functionality of the processor is done. \n\nAs a demonstration and test I've implemented the \"Sieve of Eratosthenes\" it's an efficient prime number finding algorithm. I have two modifications from the simple form of the algorithm, even numbers are skipped entirely and the Sieve is segmented into blocks of 256 values. This prevents large delays between the early smaller primes as it fills in a larger table. \n\nRead more about the Sieve here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\nOr Eratosthenes himself here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes\n\nThe \"instructions per cycle\" I give in the video is approximate, I'll build some hardware for measuring it more precisely in the future but it's inline with expectations. There is a larger table of processors for comparison here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second\n\nThat bit where I say \"the last few evenings\" may have been a gross understatement."
