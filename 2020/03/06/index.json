    "Description": "I have been curious about data compression and the Zip file format in particular for a long time. At some point I decided to address that by learning how it works and writing my own Zip program. The implementation turned into an exciting programming exercise; there is great pleasure to be had from creating a well oiled machine that takes data apart, jumbles its bits into a more efficient representation, and puts it all back together again. Hopefully it is interesting to read about too."

    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are the central focus of modern machine\nlearning systems. As data volumes keep growing, it has become customary to\ntrain large neural networks with hundreds of millions of parameters to maintain\nenough capacity to memorize these volumes and obtain state-of-the-art accuracy.\nTo get around the costly computations associated with large models and data,\nthe community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model\ntraining. However, specialized hardware is expensive and hard to generalize to\na multitude of tasks. The progress on the algorithmic front has failed to\ndemonstrate a direct advantage over powerful hardware such as NVIDIA-V100 GPUs.\nThis paper provides an exception. We propose SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning\nEngine) that uniquely blends smart randomized algorithms, with multi-core\nparallelism and workload optimization. Using just a CPU, SLIDE drastically\nreduces the computations during both training and inference outperforming an\noptimized implementation of Tensorflow (TF) on the best available GPU. Our\nevaluations on industry-scale recommendation datasets, with large fully\nconnected architectures, show that training with SLIDE on a 44 core CPU is more\nthan 3.5 times (1 hour vs. 3.5 hours) faster than the same network trained\nusing TF on Tesla V100 at any given accuracy level. On the same CPU hardware,\nSLIDE is over 10x faster than TF. We provide codes and scripts for\nreproducibility."
