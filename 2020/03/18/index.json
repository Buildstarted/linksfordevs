Decades later, Prince of Persia remains a classic example of how the constraints of early gaming led to solutions that advanced the artform.\r\n\r\nDirected and Produced by Justin Wolfson\r\nEdited/GFX by Parker Dixon\r\n\r\nFootage used in this video:\r\nAchievementX360Nerds:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc6F1u2Plpw\r\nOld Classic Retro Gaming:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqxN-HEfSxU\r\nDerSchmu:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20jf2ti9ZDE\r\nMauri al Pedo:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDeIWfz_EM4\r\nVarious For: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVKJZeSpDR0\r\nAl82: Retrogaming & Computing:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZtkPZih-3s\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK-5jK1-LrQ\r\nWorld-of-Longplays:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thAmYGc37pA\r\ngroovymacgames:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjR_AhxPnVM\r\nOtakuChest:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv20j8ChtRY\r\nDan Prince:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pLxQmv8ZFI\r\nhirudov2d:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZDAPp61aak\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGxb10aTe5g\r\nKapeesh:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAC6zZbrz-g\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77hLHTHMwQo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wsrW3VnvCo\r\n\n\nConnect with Ars Technica:\r\nVisit ArsTechnica.com: http://arstechnica.com\r\nFollow Ars Technica on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/arstechnica\r\nFollow Ars Technica on Google+: https://plus.google.com/+ArsTechnica/videos\r\nFollow Ars Technica on Twitter: https://twitter.com/arstechnica\r\n\n\nHow Prince of Persia Defeated Apple II's Memory Limitations | War Stories | Ars Technica"

    "Description": "The philosophy of computer science is concerned with those\nontological, methodological, and ethical issues that arise from within\nthe academic discipline of computer science as well as from the\npractice of software development. Thus, the philosophy of computer\nscience shares the same philosophical goals as the philosophy of\nmathematics and the many subfields of the philosophy of science, such\nas the philosophy of biology or the philosophy of the social sciences.\nThe philosophy of computer science also considers the analysis of\ncomputational artifacts, that is, human-made\ncomputing systems, and it focuses on methods involved in the design,\nspecification, programming, verification, implementation, and testing\nof those systems. The abstract nature of computer programs and the\nresulting complexity of implemented artifacts, coupled with the\ntechnological ambitions of computer science, ensures that many of the\nconceptual questions of the philosophy of computer science have\nanalogues in the\n philosophy of mathematics,\n the philosophy of empirical sciences, and the\n philosophy of technology.\n Other issues characterize the philosophy of computer science only. We\nshall concentrate on three tightly related groups of topics that form\nthe spine of the subject. First we discuss topics related to the\nontological analysis of computational artifacts, in Sections 1–5\nbelow. Second, we discuss topics involved in the methodology and\nepistemology of software development, in Sections 6–9 below.\nThird, we discuss ethical issues arising from computer science\npractice, in Section 10 below. Applications of computer science are\nbriefly considered in section 11."
