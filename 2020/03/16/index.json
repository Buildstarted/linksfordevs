    "Description": "Achieving high-performance GPU kernels requires optimizing algorithm\nimplementations to the targeted GPU architecture. It is of utmost importance to\nfully use the compute and memory hierarchy, as well as available specialised\nhardware. Currently, vendor libraries like cuBLAS and cuDNN provide the best\nperforming implementations of GPU algorithms. However the task of the library\nprogrammer is incredibly challenging: for each provided algorithm,\nhigh-performance implementations have to be developed for all commonly used\narchitectures, input sizes, and different storage formats. These\nimplementations are generally provided as optimized assembly code because\nperformance-critical architectural features are only exposed at this level.\nThis prevents reuse between different implementations of even the same\nalgorithm, as simple differences can have major effects on low-level\nimplementation details. In this paper we introduce Fireiron, a DSL and compiler\nwhich allows the specification of high-performance GPU implementations as\ncompositions of simple and reusable building blocks. We show how to use\nFireiron to optimize matrix multiplication implementations, achieving\nperformance matching hand-coded CUDA kernels, even when using specialised\nhardware such as NIVIDA Tensor Cores, and outperforming state-of-the-art\nimplementations provided by cuBLAS by more than 2x."
