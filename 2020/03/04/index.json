This customer's application is not an external facing and needs to be on a corporate network to access their resources (e.g. HR, payroll,procurement etc..) If you are familiar with the Kubernetes eco system, we can use NGINX ingress controller to expose Kubernetes services on an external IP address. Azure Kubernetes Services comes to the rescue. AKS provides an option to deploy your NGINX ingress controller on an internal network which keeps the resources accessible only on an internal network and can be accessible via Express Route or VPN."
