    "Description": "I made an audio deepfake of my voice along with Obama and Trump! \n\n\nSamples:\n* Donkey: https://soundcloud.com/galacticglum/sets/donkey-audio-deepfake-cnn-tts\n* Obama: https://soundcloud.com/galacticglum/sets/obama-audio-deepfake-cnn-tts\n* Trump: https://soundcloud.com/galacticglum/sets/trump-audio-deepfake-cnn-tts\n\n Powered by a text-to-speech model using Deep Convolutional networks with transfer learning. Based on Efficiently Trainable Text-to-Speech System Based on Deep Convolutional Networks with Guided Attention (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08969) and dc_tts (https://github.com/Kyubyong/dc_tts), an implementation of the methods described by the paper. \n\nCurrently, I'm working on cleaning up the source code and rewriting it to a newer version of Tensorflow. I hope to eventually release a consolidated CLI to streamline usage of the TTS model.\n\nTransfer learning based approach:\nGiven a really well-trained model (this means a model that has been trained on both A LOT of data for A LOT of time), we can significantly reduce the training of 'derivative' voices if we simply 'transfer' the weights from the pretrained model. Further training off this model is simply fine-tuning it to fit the specific voice; rather than the more generic base. You can think of this as training the model to do an impression of the target voice. It's pretty cool, I know!\n\nFurther Notes:\nAll the models you heard in this were trained on roughly 10-15 minutes of data samples (consisting of clips that range between 2-10 seconds). All the datasets were manually made by splitting audio recordings into small clips and then transcribing them. I experimented with many different voices for this video (e.g. Donkey and Shrek) and I found that the best results come from when extreme tone is minimized. This is why the Donkey results were never very good. As well as the fact the there is constantly music and other noise in Donkey scenes. TL;DR: if you're trying this at home, remember to get CLEAN data (e.g. no noise in the background, trimmed silence, consistent tone).\n\nThe Obama model was trained on 130 samples (12 minutes and 55 seconds total time) sourced from \"The President's Speech in Cairo: A New Beginning.\" Likewise, The Trump model was trained on 136 samples (12 minutes and 11.8 seconds total time).\n\n\n\n ————————————————————————————————— \nJoin our Discord! https://discord.gg/hnpccXy\n\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/galacticglum/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/galacticglum/\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/galacticglum/\n\n—————————————————————————————————\n\nI use Adobe Premiere Pro 2020 CC for editing my videos and Adobe After Effects 2020 CC for animation.\n\nI primarily use the Canon T6i with a 50mm f/1.8 STM lens and a 60mm f/2.8 macro 2:1 lens.

    "Description": "Hello! Okay, now I can show you what I meant about the graphical improvements last time instead of trying to explain in words, ha ha. For reference, here is a hillside in Classic DF: This is a cutaway view at one altitude. This view has been pretty confusing for new players. All you need to know is that it's a grid of uniform size, and the upward triangles are ramps. Dwarves can walk up those to the next highest level. Here is a similar view in Dwarf Fortress Premium."
