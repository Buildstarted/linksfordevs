    "Description": "The P5P ProtocolAbstract\n\t\t\tThis is the specification of the \"Pretty Please Platform for \n\t\t\tParticipating Publishers\" (P5P). This document, along with its \n\t\t\tnormative references, includes all the specification necessary for \n\t\t\tthe implementation of interoperable P5P clients and servers.\n\t\t\tIntroduction\"Pretty Please Platform for Participating \n\t\t\tPublishers\" (P5P) is a modest proposal that enables users to express \n\t\t\ttheir privacy and other preferences in a standard format that can be \n\t\t\tretrieved automatically and interpreted easily by web publishers.\n\t\t\tP5P provides an opt-in mechanism for a user to convey their \n\t\t\tpotentially intricate personal preferences to a publisher website. \n\t\t\tThe protocol defines a large set of tokens that the user may express \n\t\t\tthat they wish the web publisher to respect. P5P-compatible \n\t\t\tsites will be notified of the user's personal preferences, and may \n\t\t\tautomate their behavior based on these preferences as appropriate. \n\t\t\tThus, each individual server need not query the user for preferences \n\t\t\tmanually at each visit and may instead automatically determine the \n\t\t\tuser's preferences. The user may change their mind at any time and \n\t\t\tadjust preferences in a single location.Although P5P \n\t\t\tprovides a technical mechanism for enabling websites to be aware of \n\t\t\ttheir visitors' preferences, there is of course no technical means \n\t\t\tby which a web client can enforce or verify that the server actually \n\t\t\trespects the preferences expressed by the client. Therefore, the use \n\t\t\tof the standard \"pretty please\" syntax helps ensure that the web \n\t\t\tpublisher understands that the users' preferences are strongly held \n\t\t\tand they should feel very badly if those preferences are not \n\t\t\trespected. TerminologyThe keywords MUST, MUST NOT, \n\t\t\tREQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, \n\t\t\tand OPTIONAL, when they appear in this document, are to be \n\t\t\tinterpreted as described in RFC2119 [0].Status of this \n\t\t\tDocumentThis document is expected to progress according to the \n\t\t\tprocess described in RFC 1438 [1].Determining the User's P5P \n\t\t\tPreferencesIn the P5P System, the user's browser expresses their \n\t\t\tpreferences using the P5P HTTP Request header. Naturally, \n\t\t\tadding hundreds of P5P tokens to outbound requests would negatively \n\t\t\timpact browsers' investments in network performance [7]. Therefore, \n\t\t\tthe P5P request header may contain either a short list of compact \n\t\t\tP5P tokens, or may contain a reference URL that points to a policy \n\t\t\tthe user has created or has selected from a gallery of such policies \n\t\t\tauthored by experts. It is expected that privacy wonks and other \n\t\t\tspecial interest communities will publish \"reference\" statements \n\t\t\tthat users may select from.Example #1:P5P: NO-TRACK, \n\t\t\tPINKY-SWEAR...specifies that the server should not track the \n\t\t\tuser. The PINKY-SWEAR token is described in the Policy Tokens \n\t\t\tsection below.Example #2:P5P: \n\t\t\thttp://example.com/I-Love-Kittens.p5p...specifies that the \n\t\t\tserver should download and parse the specified P5P document from the \n\t\t\tprovided URL. The P5P statement at this location contains \n\t\t\tpreferences of interest to cat lovers; see Policy Tokens below.\n\t\t\tIf the web server receives multiple P5P statements, it SHOULD \n\t\t\tconstruct the user's preferences as the union of the statements. In \n\t\t\tthe event of flat-out contradictions in the user's preferences, the \n\t\t\tserver MAY refuse to return a response and provide a HTTP/406 Not \n\t\t\tAcceptable response indicating that the server entity cannot satisfy \n\t\t\tthe client's request conditions.Policy TokensTokens \n\t\t\tconsist of a simple case-insensitive sequence of ASCII characters \n\t\t\tfrom the set ['-', 'A'-'z']. Tokens that require a value will follow \n\t\t\tthe token with a single equal sign and a quoted value string. If a \n\t\t\ttoken value is omitted, the implicit default value of \"true\" MUST be \n\t\t\tassumed.Offering a rich set of policy tokens is critical to \n\t\t\tthe success of the P5P specification. This version of the \n\t\t\tspecification introduces a core set of preference tokens that the \n\t\t\tuser may specify, but it is expected that future versions of this \n\t\t\tspecification will include additional tokens as the need for such \n\t\t\ttokens is expressed by users. As you can imagine, there are many \n\t\t\tpieces of valuable metadata that the user may share. We expect \n\t\t\tseveral large social networking sites will be eager to participate \n\t\t\tin this system and will offer to auto-generate P5P declarations \n\t\t\tbased on the private information they have aggregated over their \n\t\t\tuser's thousands of actions.The tokens defined in this \n\t\t\tversion of the specification are as follows:NO-TRACKThe \n\t\t\tclient does not wish to be tracked. The server SHOULD interpret this \n\t\t\ttoken in the same manner as the Do-Not-Track header (DNT: 1). \n\t\t\tServers MUST immediately discontinue the use of RFC3751 OP [20] \n\t\t\tif this directive is specified by the client.\n\t\t\tOSTRICH-MODE-PRIVACYThe client indicates that tracking is \n\t\t\tacceptable, but only if they can see the tracker. Servers MAY track \n\t\t\tthe user using visible content and MUST NOT track the user using any \n\t\t\tinvisible tracking pixels, tracking JavaScript, reverse-IP-tracking, \n\t\t\tor any backend process.NO-EVILThe client does not want \n\t\t\tthe server to do anything evil in response to the HTTP request. The \n\t\t\tscope of \"evil\" may vary by user and hence clients SHOULD attempt to \n\t\t\tprovide more specific directives as well. The server SHOULD attempt \n\t\t\tto do as little evil as is required to service the user's request.\n\t\t\tNote: The server MUST NOT return any response to the client if \n\t\t\tthe generation of that response involves any TCP/IP connection with \n\t\t\tthe RFC3514 evil bit set [10].NO-PHISHThe NO-PHISH \n\t\t\tdirective indicates that the client would prefer not to see any \n\t\t\tsocially engineered content soliciting the user's credentials or \n\t\t\tother personal information. This mechanism is considerably simpler \n\t\t\tand less expensive than building a real-time reputation service [8] \n\t\t\tand thus can be used by any browser. Note: Do not confuse \n\t\t\twith NO-FISH.NO-FISHThe NO-FISH directive indicates that \n\t\t\tthe client would prefer not to view any more hardware accelerated \n\t\t\tdemos involving swimming beta-fish, e.g. [9]. Web publishers may \n\t\t\trespond by instead showing another animal or by presenting the user \n\t\t\twith a survey inquiring as to how the user developed animosity \n\t\t\ttoward aquatic life.Note: Do not confuse with NO-PHISH.\n\t\t\tNO-POPUPSIndicates that the user would prefer not to receive \n\t\t\tany form of popup window, no matter what wonderful and unique \n\t\t\topportunity is offered in such a window. Note: Early field \n\t\t\tdata suggests that this preference is universally held.\n\t\t\tNO-ADS-IM-SURE-YOU-WILL-FIGURE-OUT-ANOTHER-BUSINESS-MODEL\n\t\t\tIndicates that the user does not wish to be shown any form of \n\t\t\tadvertising content, and expresses their earnest belief that the web \n\t\t\tpublisher will find some way to remain in business without an income \n\t\t\tstream.Note: This preference appears to be far more common \n\t\t\tthan the related NO-ADS-HERE-IS-MY-BILLING-INFO-INSTEAD value.\n\t\t\tNO-CELEBRITY-GOSSIPIndicates that the user is not a fan of \n\t\t\tcelebrity gossip and thus servers SHOULD refrain from serving \n\t\t\tcontent in this theme.Note: Clients sending this token may \n\t\t\tfind that many \"news\" sites appear to be blank.\n\t\t\tSERVE-ME-ADS-BASED-ON-MY-SELF-IMAGE-RATHER-THAN-MY-BEHAVIOR\n\t\t\tIndicates that the web publisher should select relevant advertising \n\t\t\tbased on the user's self-expressed image (contained elsewhere in the \n\t\t\tP5P declaration) rather than based on analysis of the user's \n\t\t\tbehavior on the web.For instance, if the user combines this \n\t\t\tpreference with the NO-CELEBRITY-GOSSIP preference, they should not \n\t\t\tbe served advertisements associated with celebrities, even after \n\t\t\tissuing hourly search queries for \"brangelina\".MOOD=value\n\t\t\tExpresses the user's current mood, utilizing the values defined in \n\t\t\tRFC5841 [22]. The server SHOULD react in a sympathetic way \n\t\t\tand may infer other P5P directives in response to the specified \n\t\t\tmood.As mood is often ephemeral and not stable over long \n\t\t\tperiods of time, client software SHOULD make configuration of this \n\t\t\tflag simple and MAY infer it from observations of the user. \n\t\t\tCAT-PERSONIndicates that the user is a \"Cat person\" and site \n\t\t\tthemes and stories should be adjusted accordingly.DOG-PERSON\n\t\t\tIndicates that the user is a \"Dog person\" and site themes and \n\t\t\tstories should be adjusted accordingly.IS-A-DOGIndicates \n\t\t\tthat the user is actually a canine. This token satisfies a \n\t\t\tlongstanding limitation of the Internet [11].Note: An \n\t\t\toptional value token allows specification of the visitor's breed; if \n\t\t\tmissing, the default value \"mutt\" is assumed.\n\t\t\tUSER-MIME-TYPE=valueProvides attributes describing the user's \n\t\t\tphysical traits in the format specified by RFC1437 [17].\n\t\t\tSORRY-I-AM-BROKE-RIGHT-NOWThe user expresses that they currently \n\t\t\tlack funds and appeals for donations or other financing cannot be \n\t\t\taccommodated at this time. Internet Merchants MAY elect to \n\t\t\toffer special \"zero-down financing\" offers. Advertisers SHOULD avoid \n\t\t\tadvertising luxury items to clients that send this preference as \n\t\t\tthese may be offensive to the user.SIGN=valueIndicates \n\t\t\tthe user's astrological sign. This information may prove very useful \n\t\t\tin allowing sites to tailor their content to the user's temperament \n\t\t\tand outlook on life. Web publishers MAY correlate this information \n\t\t\twith a 3rd-party service to further tailor their content based on \n\t\t\tthe visitor's latest horoscope information.\n\t\t\tFAVORITE-COLOR=valueThe client expresses their favorite color \n\t\t\tusing a HTML color string; the website SHOULD react by coloring as \n\t\t\tmany UI elements as possible using colors that match or complement \n\t\t\tthe specified color. Websites SHOULD support a \n\t\t\tcomma-delimited sequence of color tokens for those users who just \n\t\t\tcan't settle on one favorite.AGE=valueThe user expresses \n\t\t\ttheir age as an integer, or a string containing a fraction.\n\t\t\tNote: The fractional format is particularly popular for those under \n\t\t\tage 12. \"Ten and three quarters\" conveys important additional status \n\t\t\tamongst the user's peer group.ACTUALAGE=valueThe user \n\t\t\texpresses their *true* age accurately as an integer. Note: \n\t\t\tField research suggests that as ACTUALAGE is lower than AGE until \n\t\t\tthe ACTUALAGE value reaches 21. Often AGE=ACTUALAGE from 21-28, then \n\t\t\tAGE remains relatively constant despite increasing ACTUALAGE.\n\t\t\tDONT-TELL-MOMThe user expresses that they would like the \n\t\t\tserver to help them avoid any sequence of events that would result \n\t\t\tin their mother becoming aware of their web traffic.Note: \n\t\t\tThis token appears to be popular even when ACTUALAGE exceeds the age \n\t\t\tof majority for a given locale.I-AM-SCHMIDTIndicates \n\t\t\tthat user is willing for the web publisher to track and share their \n\t\t\tbehavior with any other party. The user is thus indicating that they \n\t\t\twould never be doing anything that they wouldn't want everyone to \n\t\t\tknow about [27].DO-NOT-SUEIndicates that the client \n\t\t\twould prefer that the server fail to return a response if the \n\t\t\treceipt of the response would put the client in legal jeopardy (e.g. \n\t\t\tdue to intellectual property concerns).DO-NOT-CENSOR\n\t\t\tIndicates that the client should be exempted from all forms of \n\t\t\tcensorship. Web publishers MAY ignore this preference if the client \n\t\t\texpresses an IS-A-MINOR value which indicates that the user has not \n\t\t\treached the age of majority.Note that intermediaries SHOULD \n\t\t\tleave this token intact in the client's request and SHOULD NOT \n\t\t\totherwise interfere with the request or response. It is hoped that \n\t\t\tthe Pretty Please token is sufficient to indicate to any \n\t\t\tintermediaries that the client bears no nefarious intent.\n\t\t\tI-OWN-MY-WORDSWith this token, the user asserts ownership of the \n\t\t\tcontent they have submitted to the server, specifically prohibiting \n\t\t\tits reuse for any other purpose. Servers may implement this \n\t\t\tpreference using [24] as it is expected that this mechanism will \n\t\t\tprovide an equivalent level of protection.FOSS-ONLYThe \n\t\t\tuser expresses that they are only willing to accept responses \n\t\t\tgenerated purely via Free and Open Source hardware and software \n\t\t\tstacks. Servers, routers and gateways SHOULD not satisfy any request \n\t\t\tif any proprietary hardware or software is needed to generate a \n\t\t\tresponse.NO-SHINYThe user expresses that they are \n\t\t\tunwilling to accept responses that are built upon Rich Internet \n\t\t\tApplication frameworks like Adobe Flash.Note: This \n\t\t\tpreference is sometimes indicated by users but is more commonly \n\t\t\timposed due to hardware lock-in limitations enforced by certain \n\t\t\tvendors.OPEN-CONTENT-ONLYThe user expresses that they \n\t\t\tare only willing to view content which is freely available via a \n\t\t\tsuitable Creative Commons license. If no such content is available, \n\t\t\tthe server SHOULD NOT return anything. The server MAY instead return \n\t\t\tcontent unrelated to the user's request that satisfies the user's \n\t\t\tlicense demands.GEEZ-I-AM-AT-WORKThe user expresses that \n\t\t\tthey are at work and only wish to view content which is appropriate \n\t\t\tfor that environment. All NSFW content should be suppressed \n\t\t\tby the web publisher.Note: This may result in many web pages \n\t\t\tappearing completely blank.\n\t\t\tYOUTUBE-YOU-MAY-THINK-YOU-ARE-FUNNY-BUT-YOU-ARE-NOTSuggests that \n\t\t\ta popular video sharing site stop generating a phony context menu \n\t\t\tthat overrides the default Save Video option in their HTML5 video \n\t\t\tplayer [28] such that user is \"rick-rolled\" into watching a Rick \n\t\t\tAstley music video [29].INTERNETISSERIOUSBUSINESS\n\t\t\tIndicates that the user believes that the Internet should be used \n\t\t\tfor serious business and tomfoolery should be limited. In \n\t\t\tparticular, users sending this token should not be served novelty \n\t\t\tRFCs published on the first day of the fourth month or similarly \n\t\t\tsilly content.ICANHAZCHEEZBURGERNon-intuitively, \n\t\t\tindicates that the user wishes to be shown pictures of cats arranged \n\t\t\tin unlikely circumstances. Ideally, images should contain mildly \n\t\t\tamusing captions and be suitable for sharing with others.\n\t\t\tICANHAZCATNon-intuitively, indicates that the user wishes to be \n\t\t\tshown pictures of ground beef products arranged in unlikely \n\t\t\tcircumstances. Ideally, images should contain mildly amusing \n\t\t\tcaptions and be suitable for sharing with others.NO-MEMES\n\t\t\tIndicates that the user is not a follower of Internet-spread memes \n\t\t\tand thus would prefer not to read content with oblique references to \n\t\t\tsuch memes. Servers SHOULD avoid referencing memes as they won't \n\t\t\tmake any sense to the user and MAY lead to confusion or other \n\t\t\tunhappy feelings. NO-MIMESIndicates that the user would \n\t\t\tprefer to avoid images or video content of mimes, feeling that such \n\t\t\tperformers are \"just creepy.\" Servers SHOULD avoid displaying any \n\t\t\tmimes to avoid giving the user nightmares.Note: This token \n\t\t\thas nothing to do with Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions [31].\n\t\t\tIS-A-MINOR=valueA \"true\" value indicates that the user has \n\t\t\tnot attained the age of majority within their locale and thus is not \n\t\t\tyet an adult. A \"false\" value indicates that the user has reached \n\t\t\tthe age of majority and thus may be shown adult content. \n\t\t\tNote: The GEEZ-I-AM-AT-WORK token, if present, should be respected \n\t\t\teven if IS-A-MINOR=\"false\".Note: Do not confuse with the \n\t\t\tunrelated IS-A-MINER token.IS-A-MINERIndicates that the \n\t\t\tuser is charged with extracting elements of value from subterranean \n\t\t\tlocales, typically using a shovel or pick. Websites MAY wish \n\t\t\tto react to this token by utilizing a darker color palette to avoid \n\t\t\tcausing undue stress for the often light-sensitive eyes of visitors \n\t\t\tin this line of work.Note: Do not confuse with the unrelated \n\t\t\tIS-A-MINOR token. Most children prefer bright shiny things.\n\t\t\tNOT-PUNNYIndicates that the user has recognized puns are the \n\t\t\tlowest form of wit, and are typically only deemed funny by their \n\t\t\tauthors.Websites SHOULD limit their use of puns and other \n\t\t\twordplay when this token is expressed by the user.SSN=value\n\t\t\tA United States-based user may use this token to provide their \n\t\t\tSocial Security Number.When sending this token, clients \n\t\t\tSHOULD also send the NO-EVIL token to ensure that nothing bad \n\t\t\thappens.DONT-TASE-ME-BROThe user expresses the desire to \n\t\t\tavoid any form of physical violence, and specifically suggests that \n\t\t\telectric darts would not be welcomed [26].COFFEE=value\n\t\t\tDescribes the user's coffee preferences, valid tokens include \"hot\", \n\t\t\t\"decaf\", \"blank\", \"milk\", and \"iced\". Note: servers SHOULD \n\t\t\tsupport \"decaf\" even if the underlying implementation is dependent \n\t\t\tupon RFC2324 [18]Note: this syntax is insufficiently \n\t\t\texpressive for patrons of Starbucks. For expressing the 87,000 \n\t\t\tpossible configurations of Starbucks coffee, the client MAY provide \n\t\t\ta base64 encoded byte array, compressed with DEFLATE [30].\n\t\t\tI-AM-COMFORTABLE-WITH-MY-WEIGHT-THANK-YOUThe user requests that \n\t\t\tthe web publisher avoid showing weight-loss advertisements, \n\t\t\tespecially those which attempt to incite self-consciousness on the \n\t\t\tpart of the user.DO-NOT-CRASHThe user requests that the \n\t\t\twebsite avoid crashing for the duration of the request. Web \n\t\t\tpublishers should see RFC748 [12] for help in converting this \n\t\t\tdirective into protocol level preferences that will help satisfy the \n\t\t\trequest. The routing mechanisms defined in RFC1217 [23] are \n\t\t\tgenerally not suitable for satisfying requests bearing this \n\t\t\tpreference.I-WEAR-A-TINFOIL-HATThe user expresses that \n\t\t\tthey are especially concerned about information leakage and external \n\t\t\tinterference with their personal thought processes.Web \n\t\t\tpublishers should see RFC1097 [13] for help in converting this \n\t\t\tdirective into protocol level preferences that will help avoid \n\t\t\tinadvertent subliminal messaging.I-AM-JUST-IMPATIENTThis \n\t\t\ttoken indicates that the user is inclined toward impatience and may \n\t\t\tfrequently refresh the page due to the eagerness to receive new \n\t\t\tcontent.Servers SHOULD NOT interpret unnaturally frequent \n\t\t\trequests bearing this token as a Denial-of-Service attack.\n\t\t\tNote: In the wild, this token is rarely correlated with the \n\t\t\tCOFFEE=\"decaf\" token. If both tokens are present, servers MAY \n\t\t\tconclude that the request is malicious.\n\t\t\tGO-FASTER-I-AM-IN-A-HURRYThe user expresses that they are under \n\t\t\ta time constraint and the operation should be completed as quickly \n\t\t\tas possible. Web publishers should avoid any process which \n\t\t\trelies upon RFC1149 [14] or RFC2549 [15] in satisfying this request \n\t\t\tas these implementations are unlikely to meet the performance \n\t\t\trequirements implied by this directive. ULS technology [16] should \n\t\t\tbe avoided in servicing requests with this token, particularly if \n\t\t\tthe website is communicating any non-positive news. SFSS [21] may \n\t\t\tonly be used if the endpoints are particularly talented and can \n\t\t\tmaintain sustained throughput of 300spm; compression is highly \n\t\t\trecommended. NO-RABBLEThe user expresses that their time \n\t\t\tis valuable and they have no desire to read remarks from anonymous \n\t\t\tinternet users unless those remarks have been deemed exceptionally \n\t\t\tinsightful. Note, this preference is generally incompatible \n\t\t\twith content generated under RFC2795 [19] and similar processes in \n\t\t\tuse on most Internet sites.PINKY-SWEARIf this token is \n\t\t\tpresent, the client asserts that it is providing only truthful \n\t\t\tinformation in the provided P5P statement. For instance, an \n\t\t\texpressed AGE value MUST equal ACTUALAGE.Further the client \n\t\t\tdemands that the server also be an honest dealer and the server MUST \n\t\t\taccommodate all of the client's preferences or it MUST return a \n\t\t\tHTTP/406 response.ConclusionContrary to common belief, \n\t\t\tthere is no inherent conflict between the goals and desires of web \n\t\t\tusers and web publishers, content providers, tracking firms, and \n\t\t\tadvertisers. Instead, the only missing piece has been a \n\t\t\tmechanism whereby the user can clearly and unambiguously state their \n\t\t\tpreferences. P5P provides that mechanism. Websites can now easily \n\t\t\tlearn their users' preferences and if their default practices and \n\t\t\tgoals are in conflict with a given visitor's preferences, they may \n\t\t\teasily adjust their practice to accommodate their valued guests.\n\t\t\tAppendix 1: Relationship to other specificationsP3P\n\t\t\tThe Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) specification [2] \n\t\t\tprovides a mechanism by which a given web publisher may advertise a \n\t\t\tlegally-binding statement of their privacy practices. \n\t\t\tBrowsers may interpret the P3P tokens and restrict [3] the \n\t\t\tfunctionality of mechanisms useful for tracking the user if the web \n\t\t\tpublisher advertises practices that are offensive to the user's \n\t\t\tsensibilities.Unfortunately, in the face of such automated \n\t\t\tenforcement, some popular websites [4] express P3P declarations \n\t\t\tusing technically legal but semantically meaningless policy \n\t\t\tstatements. For example: P3P: CP=\"If we told you what we do \n\t\t\twith these cookies, your browser would block them automatically, so \n\t\t\twe will not.\"As the P3P specification suggests that browsers \n\t\t\tshould ignore unknown tokens, the previous statement is technically \n\t\t\ta valid statement with undefined meaning.The same is true \n\t\t\tfor the following P3P declaration based upon an undocumented Jedi \n\t\t\tmind trick:P3P: CP=\"This is not a P3P policy! See \n\t\t\thttp://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=151657 \n\t\t\tfor more info.\" It is inelegantly left to the courts to \n\t\t\tdecide whether such statements constitute falsehood by omission, in \n\t\t\tthe same vein as a child who, when asked to enumerate what he ate at \n\t\t\this friend's house, mentions the carrots but fails to mention the \n\t\t\tquart of ice cream.P5P resolves the untrustworthy publisher \n\t\t\tproblem by saying \"Pretty Please.\" Even small children know that a \n\t\t\trequest expressed with the \"Pretty Please\" token is much more likely \n\t\t\tto be accommodated than one that lacks this important token. \n\t\t\tDo-Not-TrackThe \"Do-Not-Track\" specification [25] enables a \n\t\t\tweb user to communicate to the web server that tracking is not \n\t\t\tdesired. The exact mechanism used for this communication is a HTTP \n\t\t\tRequest header of the following form:DNT: 1Unlike \n\t\t\tP5P, the Do-Not-Track header does not include any \"Pretty Please\" \n\t\t\ttokens and thus is somewhat rude.Advertisers have expressed \n\t\t\tthe concern that the Do-Not-Track header is \"like sending a smoke \n\t\t\tsignal in the middle of Manhattan; it might draw a lot of attention, \n\t\t\tbut no one knows how to read the message\" [5]. P5P helps resolve \n\t\t\tthis ambiguity by providing a rich set of policy tokens that enable \n\t\t\tthe web site to understand the specific details of the user's \n\t\t\tpreferences.Web Tracking ProtectionThe Web Tracking \n\t\t\tProtection specification [6] describes a feature that allows a \n\t\t\tbrowser user to select one or more Tracking Protection Lists (TPLs) \n\t\t\tor generate their own. Each TPL expresses a set of policies as to \n\t\t\twhich web addresses the browser may contact in a 3rd party context. \n\t\t\tA TPL effectively acts as a \"Do-not-call\" list for browser users who \n\t\t\tdo not wish to send information to web publishers who may \n\t\t\tpotentially track them.One popular browser implementation \n\t\t\tuses the presence of one or more configured TPLs as a signal that it \n\t\t\tshould also send the DNT: 1 header to indicate the implied user \n\t\t\tpreference that they do not wish to be tracked.Because Web \n\t\t\tTracking Protection enables privacy using technical means rather \n\t\t\tthan relying upon the goodwill of web tracking companies, it does \n\t\t\tnot give the web tracking companies the opportunity to interpret the \n\t\t\tuser's potentially rich set of personal preferences and react \n\t\t\taccordingly. As Web Tracking Protection is technically \n\t\t\tenforced by client browser software, the web publisher and web \n\t\t\ttracking companies may find it difficult to successfully offer a \n\t\t\tTPL-protected web user \"valuable offers\" and \"unique opportunities\".\n\t\t\tIn addition, because TPLs can prevent a tracking or analytics \n\t\t\tcompany from accumulating, analyzing, and developing a per-user \n\t\t\tprofile that can be sold to web publishers around the web, users may \n\t\t\tsee less relevant offers and opportunities. P5P mitigates this \n\t\t\tproblem by enabling a P5P user to express a rich set of information \n\t\t\tabout their personal interests and preferences. Appendix 2: \n\t\t\tInternational ImplicationsThe World Wide Web is an international \n\t\t\tnetwork that spans the world and thus can be subject to different \n\t\t\tlegal and regulatory requirements in every locale. Privacy \n\t\t\tmechanisms which depend upon a specific regulatory framework can \n\t\t\toften be circumvented by placing a node within a more lax regulatory \n\t\t\tlocale. In contrast, the P5P mechanism does not depend on \n\t\t\tlegal or regulatory frameworks and instead operates based on the \n\t\t\tuniversally-recognized value that humans bestow upon politeness.\n\t\t\tAppendix 3: Related References[0]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[1]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1438 [2]\n\t\t\thttp://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/\n\t\t\t[3]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537343(v=vs.85).aspx\n\t\t\t[4] \n\t\t\thttp://www.facebook.com/help/?topic=p3p[5]http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704692904576166820102959428.html\n\t\t\t[6] \n\t\t\thttp://www.w3.org/Submission/web-tracking-protection/[7]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/07/14/caching-improvements-in-internet-explorer-9.aspx\n\t\t\t[8]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/12/14/enhanced-protection-with-ie9-s-smartscreen-filter.aspx\n\t\t\t[9]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/FishIETank/Default.html\n\t\t\t[10]  \n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3514  [11]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html [12]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc748  [13]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1097  [14]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149 [15]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549  [16]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1216  [17]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1437  [18]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324 [19]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2795  [20]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3751  [21]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4824  [22]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5841  [23]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1217  [24]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_bit [25]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mayer-do-not-track-00  \n\t\t\t[26]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/09/dont-tase-me-br/ \n\t\t\t[27]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://gawker.com/5419271/google-ceo-secrets-are-for-filthy-people \n\t\t\t[28] \n\t\t\thttp://www.youtube.com/html5  [29]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ  [30]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951  [31]\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\thttp://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046"
