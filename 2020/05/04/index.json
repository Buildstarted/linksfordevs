    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "Deep neural network (DNN) is an indispensable machine learning tool for\nachieving human-level performance on many learning tasks. Yet, due to its\nblack-box nature, it is inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the\ninput data drive the decisions of the network. There are various real-world\nscenarios in which humans need to make actionable decisions based on the output\nDNNs. Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains, such as\nlegislation, law enforcement, etc. It is important that the humans making\nhigh-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by\ncombinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the\ndeployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are\nlegally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN\ntechnology is being developed, the development of new methods and studies on\nexplaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active\nresearch field. A practitioner beginning to study explainable deep learning may\nbe intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the field is taking.\nThis complexity is further exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in\ndefining what it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning\nsystem and to evaluate a system's \"ability to explain\". To alleviate this\nproblem, this article offers a \"field guide\" to deep learning explainability\nfor those uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of\na deep learning system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii)\nplaces explainability in the context of other related deep learning research\nareas, and iii) introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of\nfoundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is\ndesigned as an easy-to-digest starting point for those just embarking in the\nfield."
