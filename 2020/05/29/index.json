    "Description": "Thank you so much! To learn more and to share our manifesto, please take a look here and share: http://bit.ly/LCBFManifesto  To build transformative communities, we must perform transformative acts of liberation. Cash bail is one of the aspects of the criminal justice system that keeps communities wrapped up in systemic slavery and in debt. The need to end cash bail is not new. Thanks to the Ferguson Uprising and the Kalief Browder story, we know that the bail system creates financial barriers for those who find themselves against the criminal justice system. One of the largest barriers is not being able to afford bail.     The Louisville Community Bail Fund exists to not only bail out folks, but provide post-release support to get them from jail, fed, and to a situation of safety. LCBF also maintains a focus on preventative measures for those targeted by law enforcement and threatened with incarceration. While we work with national networks, we are also one of the only bail funds that rely entirely on support from individuals in our social justice community.    "

    "Description": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and\nbenchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on\na specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method\nstill requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language\ntask from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which\ncurrent NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up\nlanguage models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes\neven reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning\napproaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with\n175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,\nand test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is\napplied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot\ndemonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,\nquestion-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require\non-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a\nnovel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,\nwe also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles,\nas well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to\ntraining on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples\nof news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from\narticles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding\nand of GPT-3 in general."
