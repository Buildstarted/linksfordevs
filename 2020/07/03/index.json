Despite this omission, Go is \nwidely used, with an estimated 1-2 million\ndevelopers worldwide. Over the years there have been several proposals to\nadd some form of generics to the language, but the recent\nproposal written by core developers Ian Lance Taylor and Robert\nGriesemer looks likely to be included in a future version of Go."
