Despite this omission, Go is \nwidely used, with an estimated 1-2 million\ndevelopers worldwide. Over the years there have been several proposals to\nadd some form of generics to the language, but the recent\nproposal written by core developers Ian Lance Taylor and Robert\nGriesemer looks likely to be included in a future version of Go."

    "Description": "The basic concept of a read-write lock is simple. It allows multiple readers to\naccess the resource simultaneously, but at most one thread can have exclusive\nownership of the lock (a.k.a write lock). It's supposed to be an optimization,\ncomparing to simple mutex (e.g. std::mutex). As in theory, multiple readers do\nnot contend. Naively, read performance should scale linearly. However, this is\nnot the case in practice for most read-write locks, due to cacheline\npingpong-ing.\n\nCPU cacheLet's say N "
