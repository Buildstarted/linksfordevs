    "Description": "On a Spring 2019\n    walk in Beijing I saw two street sweepers\n    at a sunny corner. They were beat-up looking and grizzled but probably younger than me. They’d paused\n    work to smoke and talk. One told a story; the other’s eyes widened and then he laughed so hard he had to\n    bend over, leaning on his broom.  I suspect their jobs and pay were lousy and their lives constrained in ways I can’t\n    imagine. But they had time to smoke a cigarette and crack a joke. You know what that’s called? Waste,\n    inefficiency, a suboptimal outcome. Some of the brightest minds in our economy are earnestly engaged in stamping it\n    out. They’re winning, but everyone’s losing."
