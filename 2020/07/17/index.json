This is especially true when it comes to giving equity and issuing stock. Unless you thrive on legal and math, this part of the startup game can seem really confusing at first. If you skipped this class in business school, it’s time for a quick tour of classes of stock, and the difference they can make when it comes to startup fundraising. For the creative entrepreneur, this can seem about as fun and unsexy as accounting at first. However, knowing your classes of shares can quickly make all the difference in various outcomes, and certainly in what you get out of the ride of this venture. Those who do take the time to familiarize themselves with this part of being a startup can find it gives them a great advantage in negotiating and achieving a desirable outcome. "
