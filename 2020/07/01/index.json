    "Description": "Any time you have a benchmark that gets taken seriously, some people will start gaming the benchmark. Some famous examples in computing are the CPU benchmark specfp and video game benchmarks. With specfp, Sun managed to increase its score on 179.art (a sub-benchmark of specfp) by 12x with a compiler tweak that essentially re-wrote the benchmark kernel, which increased the Sun UltraSPARC’s overall specfp score by 20%. At times, GPU vendors have added specialized benchmark-detecting code to their drivers that lowers image quality during benchmarking to produce higher benchmark scores. Of course, gaming the benchmark isn't unique to computing and we see people do this in other fields. It’s not surprising that we see this kind of behavior since improving benchmark scores by cheating on benchmarks is much cheaper (and therefore higher ROI) than improving benchmark scores by actually improving the product."

I've discovered a way for an unauthorized app to read the contents of protected files, thus bypassing the privacy protections. This issue exists in Mojave, Catalina, and the Big Sur beta.

    "Description": "This presentation was recorded at GOTO Copenhagen 2018. #gotocon #gotocph\nhttp://gotocph.com\n\nErik Meijer - Think Like A Fundamentalist, Code Like A Hacker\n\nABSTRACT\nIn ancient times, the dream of alchemists was to mutate ordinary metals such as lead into noble metals such as gold. However, by using classic mathematics, modern physicists and chemists are much more successful in understanding and transforming matter than alchemists ever dreamt of.\nThe situation in software seems to be the opposite. Modern computer scientists have been unsuccessful in their quest to reliably turn formal specifications into code and to accurately understand the mechanics of side-effecting computation. On the other hand, software alchemists, by using classic mathematics, have been extremely successful in mutating training data into pure functions using various machine learning techniques, in particular deep learning.\nMechanically learning code from training data is often referred to as \"Software 2.0\" or \"Learning-based development\". This new paradigm of software creation will require a radical rethinking of the ancestral software engineering and imperative programming practices that have been developed in the second half of the last century.\nIn this talk we will discuss how we are building new probabilistic frameworks and differentiable programming languages [...]\n\nRead the full abstract here:\nhttps://gotocph.com/2018/sessions/615\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gotocph\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConference\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttp://gotocon.com\n#MachineLearning #ML #ProbabilisticFrameworks\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO Conference near you!

    "Description": "During these COVID-19 stay-at-home days, I’ve watched a lot of movies, old and new. Many cultural shifts are caught on film over the decades, but I’ve been most surprised by the change in pacing. In films from the 70s, individual scenes are long. They’re filled with pensive pauses and close-ups, and you get entire minute-long shots of pure framing and mood-setting. Movies from recent years have fast cuts, with not a single moment wasted. A modern feature-length film feels much denser in the sheer amount of content and audiovisual spectacle it gives to the audience."
