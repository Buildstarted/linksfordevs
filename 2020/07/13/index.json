Also evolved into a long rant, with an Easter egg.\n Background Of late, I have been attempting to move away from paper, for environmental reasons1. Years of touch typing in Colemak (rationale, config changes) and a very customized Emacs setup (including mathematica, temporary latex templates, Nix, and org-roam annotations) have more or less kept me away from analog devices."

It was annoying to ssh every time I wanted to make a modification, it was annoying to sftp or sshfs all my images, and so forth. And god forbid, if you ever wanted someone else to write something or make an edit, let me tell you, most people are not particularly happy when you tell him \"hey, I'll make you a user on my server, give me your public key so you can ssh in\"."
