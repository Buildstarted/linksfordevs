    "Description": "Here's a collection of firework star recipes using common sugar\n                (sucrose) as the fuel source. This approach is impractical for\n                commercial pyrotechnics due to being so sensetive to moisture\n                and heat. But for homemade fireworks it has several advantages.\n                It doubles as a binder and is water soluble so there's no need\n                for noxious solvents. It's also widely available and cheap."
