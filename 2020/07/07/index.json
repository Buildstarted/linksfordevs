    "Description": "A common problem when implementing concurrent programs is efficiently\nprotecting against unsafe races between processes reading and then using a\nresource (e.g., memory blocks, file descriptors, or network connections) and\nother processes that are concurrently overwriting and then destructing the same\nresource. Such read-destruct races can be protected with locks, or with\nlock-free solutions such as hazard-pointers or read-copy-update (RCU).\n  In this paper we describe a method for protecting read-destruct races with\nexpected constant time overhead, $O(P^2)$ space and $O(P^2)$ delayed destructs,\nand with just single word atomic memory operations (reads, writes, and CAS). It\nis based on an interface with four primitives, an acquire-release pair to\nprotect accesses, and a retire-eject pair to delay the destruct until it is\nsafe. We refer to this as the acquire-retire interface. Using the\nacquire-retire interface, we develop simple implementations for three common\nuse cases: (1) memory reclamation with applications to stacks and queues, (2)\nreference counted objects, and (3) objects manage by ownership with moves,\ncopies, and destructs. The first two results significantly improve on previous\nresults, and the third application is original. Importantly, all operations\nhave expected constant time overhead."

I have taught over 12 courses at Arizona State University, as well as Colgate University, including several sections of undergraduate theory.\r\n\r\n▶ABOUT THIS CHANNEL◀\r\nThe theory of computation is perhaps the fundamental theory of computer science. It sets out to define, mathematically, what exactly computation is, what is feasible to solve using a computer, and also what is not possible to solve using a computer. The main objective is to define a computer mathematically, without the reliance on real-world computers, hardware or software, or the plethora of programming languages we have in use today. The notion of a Turing machine serves this purpose and defines what we believe is the crux of all computable functions.\r\n\r\nThis channel is also about weaker forms of computation, concentrating on two classes: regular languages and context-free languages. These two models help understand what we can do with restricted means of computation, and offer a rich theory using which you can hone your mathematical skills in reasoning with simple machines and the languages they define. \r\n\r\nHowever, they are not simply there as a weak form of computation--the most attractive aspect of them is that problems formulated on them are tractable, i.e. we can build efficient algorithms to reason with objects such as finite automata, context-free grammars and pushdown automata. For example, we can model a piece of hardware (a circuit) as a finite-state system and solve whether the circuit satisfies a property (like whether it performs addition of 16-bit registers correctly). We can model the syntax of a programming language using a grammar, and build algorithms that check if a string parses according to this grammar.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most problems that ask properties about Turing machines are undecidable. This Youtube channel will help you see and prove that several tasks involving Turing machines are unsolvable---i.e., no computer, no software, can solve it. For example, you will see that there is no software that can check whether a  C program will halt on a particular input. To prove something is possible is, of course, challenging. But to show something is impossible is rare in computer science, and very humbling."

    "Description": "New consent management platforms (CMPs) have been introduced to the web to\nconform with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, particularly its\nrequirements for consent when companies collect and process users' personal\ndata. This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's\nconsent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the\ntop 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied\nconsent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet the minimal requirements that we set\nbased on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40\nparticipants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent\nchoices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect;\nremoving the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22--23\npercentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page\ndecreases consent by 8--20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical\nbasis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular\nthe possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an\neffective way to increase compliance."
