    "Description": "A retail investor would be forgiven for assuming that there are really\nonly two assets classes one should consider for personal investments:\nequities (stocks) and fixed income (bonds). Wherever you look, these two\nasset classes dominate the financial landscape. All robo-advisors and\nmost personal advisors implement a mix of bonds and equities for the\nportfolio's of their clients. The idea behind this mix is simple: bonds\nare low risk and will earn you a marginal return, while equities are\nriskier and will be the real engine of returns in good times. In bad\ntimes, bonds will rise, mitigating some of the losses of your equity\nportfolio: it's been long known and accepted that stocks and bonds have\na negative correlation. Tying this strategy together is periodic\nrebalancing, taking money off the table during bull markets (and moving\nthem to the safer bonds), and deploying money to the equity portion\nduring bear markets. This in effect overlays a mean-reversion strategy\nonto the portfolio, boosting the returns of an otherwise static\nportfolio. The archetypal allocation is 60% equities, and 40% bonds,\nthough each investor's allocation is going to differ based on his risk\ntolerance, age, and personal goals."

    "Description": "We study the problem of learning efficient algorithms that strongly\ngeneralize in the framework of neural program induction. By carefully designing\nthe input / output interfaces of the neural model and through imitation, we are\nable to learn models that produce correct results for arbitrary input sizes,\nachieving strong generalization. Moreover, by using reinforcement learning, we\noptimize for program efficiency metrics, and discover new algorithms that\nsurpass the teacher used in imitation. With this, our approach can learn to\noutperform custom-written solutions for a variety of problems, as we tested it\non sorting, searching in ordered lists and the NP-complete 0/1 knapsack\nproblem, which sets a notable milestone in the field of Neural Program\nInduction. As highlights, our learned model can perform sorting perfectly on\nany input data size we tested on, with $O(n log n)$ complexity, whilst\noutperforming hand-coded algorithms, including quick sort, in number of\noperations even for list sizes far beyond those seen during training."

While bail is intended to be used as an incentive to return to trial, in the recent years it has been used unfairly as a form of pretrial detention.
