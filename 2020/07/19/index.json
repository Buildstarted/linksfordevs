In Brave browser you can opt-in to the Brave Rewards program, which enables a BAT (Basic Attention Token) Wallet where the funds will be stored  Through the third-party service uphold com you can manage those funds and withdraw them   I can&#39;t say that the ads were very relevant all the time, but certainly more accurate to my interests than other ads showed on the Web  Nevertheless, in the last year I managed to gather 13,5 $ (11,5 €)!
