Here, we examine how the number of downloads from Sci-hub as well\nas various characteristics of publications and their authors predicts future\ncitations. Using data from 12 leading journals in economics, consumer research,\nneuroscience, and multidisciplinary research, we found that articles downloaded\nfrom Sci-hub were cited 1.72 times more than papers not downloaded from Sci-hub\nand that the number of downloads from Sci-hub was a robust predictor of future\ncitations. Among other characteristics of publications, the number of figures\nin a manuscript consistently predicts its future citations. The results suggest\nthat limited access to publications may limit some scientific research from\nachieving its full impact."
