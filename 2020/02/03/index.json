    "Description": "A recent discovery from the N64 Super Mario 64 De-Compilation Project appears to show that Super Mario 64 USA release for the Nintendo 64 was not optimized and was released as a debug version. However things are not that cut and dry. In this episode we take a deep dive in to what went on with development of Nintendo 64 games in 1996 and how this theory may not be accurate.\n\nN64 Footage was captured with an UltraHDMI and trdrop was used for framerate analysts.

    "Description": "Language is universal, but it has few indisputably universal characteristics, with cross-linguistic variation being the norm. For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates (~39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages’ structural properties and their speakers’ neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture."
