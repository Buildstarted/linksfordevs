For the rest of us, we need to get creative and use the tools we already have available. For some of us Azure AD may be that tool. If your business is already using Office 365 or Azure you may be able to use Azure AD to meet your internal authentication needs. To add convenience, you may even already have your desired users entered in Azure AD and organized into groups."
