    "Description": "On January 7, 2020, the music industry lost a giant. Neil Peart, the drummer and lyricist for the band RUSH, lost a three and and a half year battle with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. Neil will forever be one of the most influential rock drummers of all time. Over RUSH‚Äôs 40 year career, his drumming and thoughtful lyrics have been part of the soundtrack to millions of lives around the globe, and his passing has created a huge void.\n\nWhen SFC Tim Whalen heard the news, he was shocked and saddened. As a lifelong RUSH fan, he felt compelled to do something to honor Neil and the band that has meant so much in his own life. He immediately knew the song ‚ÄúTime Stand Still‚Äù would be the perfect choice.\n\nSFC Whalen relfects, \"The lyrics to this song have always resonated deeply with me, and they show Neil‚Äôs heart. I wanted to showcase the deep humanity he had in his writing. The song is about life moving too fast, due to both things we can control and things we can‚Äôt, and the desire to hold onto something just a little longer. This is such a universal message, whether it be children growing up too fast, a loved one dying, or a soldier leaving home wondering if they‚Äôll ever see their family again.‚Äù\n\nNeil Peart\nSeptember 12, 1952 - January 7, 2020\n\n‚ÄúTime Stand Still‚Äù \nMusic by Geddy Lee & Alex Lifeson\nLyrics by Neil Peart\n\nProduced and Arranged by SFC Tim Whalen\n\nSFC Chris Rettig - Vocals\nSFC Tim Whalen - Vocals\nMSG Dan Roberts - Piano\nSFC Zack Pride - Bass\nSFC Matthew Evans - Violin I\nSSG Patrick Lin - Violin II\nMSG Holly Watters - Viola\nSSG Aaron Ludwig - Cello\n\nRecorded and Mixed by SSG Michael Willis\nVideo by SSG Artie Bowman and SSG Clark McDaniel"

In this video, I'm going to focus on creating a Blazor component.\n\nCreating a Blazor component is one of the first things we want to do when we create a Blazor application. As we learned in the Blazor introduction, Blazor applications consist of many Blazor components. A Blazor component represents a part of the user interface and can be reused in your application or even in multiple applications.\n\nIn this video, I use a Blazor Server application created using the standard application template of Visual Studio 2019. The code works with .NET Core 3.1.\n\nIf you have any questions, write it in the comments below and feel free to provide feedback, and if you have any video ideas, put it in the comments as well.\n\n‚û•‚û•‚û• BLAZOR COURSE ‚û•‚û•‚û•\n\nüíé https://claudiobernasconi.teachable.com/p/blazor-creating-web-applications-with-csharp\n\n‚û•‚û•‚û• VIDEO LINKS ‚û•‚û•‚û•\n\nBlazor Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvqlC6tP3Qc\nBlazor Github: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/master/src/Components\nBlazor WebAssembly template: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio\nBootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/\n\n‚û•‚û•‚û• SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE VIDEOS ‚û•‚û•‚û•\n\nSubscribe: üîî https://claudiobernasconi.ch/Subscribe\n\n‚û•‚û•‚û• FOLLOW ME ‚û•‚û•‚û•\n\nüíé Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/CHBernasconiC\nüíé Blog: https://www.claudiobernasconi.ch\nüíé Dev.to: https://dev.to/claudiobernasconi\n\nCredit: üéµ https://www.bensound.com/"

Jesse Liberty somehow talked me into collaborating with him on writing a book on Windows 8.1 development. Actually, it wasn't a hard sell, because I've done a good amount of XAML dev, love C#, and Windows 8 / 8.1 development is a lot of fun. We co-wrote the table of contents, I wrote code samples and very rough drafts (sometimes just bullet points), and Jesse turned it into prose. That worked pretty well, but was a little too slow - especially once my work on Professional ASP.NET MVC 5 ramped up. Fortunately, Phil Japiske agreed to join us and finish the book off. Phil really nailed it - he polished off the remaining chapters, reviewed and greatly improved the existing chapters, and made sure everything was up to date for Windows 8.1."

Our upcoming keys are able to drive optimization in three areas.\nThe antenna\nThe NFC antenna has a more optimized geometry for mobile phones.¬† On average, it will be able to transfer more power.\nUpgraded chipset\nWe're tracking to use a new chipset for NFC communication and NFC power harvesting.¬† It can handle faster timing requirements and larger buffers which overall increases reliability.\nLess power consumption\nEver hear about Moore‚Äôs law?¬† Roughly, ever two years, the number of transistors on new processors doubles, due to semiconductor processes being able to make increasingly smaller transistors.¬† This allows new generations of processors to keep getting ‚Äúfaster.‚ÄùWell, there‚Äôs a bunch of different transistor technologies.¬† There are transistor technologies dedicated for low power applications -- and every generation provides less power consumption for the same processor.We‚Äôve upgraded to a new microcontroller for the new Solo products, and it nominally consumes about 25% less power, while having the same performance.¬† This is a great ‚Äúfree‚Äù optimization for us.Furthermore, our new microcontroller provides hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations (like ECC signatures), allowing us to actually both improve performance while reducing power.\nDurability\nWe want to be able to guarantee that none of our products ever ‚Äúbreak,‚Äù and can even survive underwater.To fulfill this, we‚Äôll be the first to undertake a new PCB technology and epoxy filling process to guarantee a very robust and water-proof key.¬† The PCB will have a manufactured cavity where all the components will get assembled, and then filled with transparent epoxy.\nThe USB-C connector is made very robust with the addition of solder welds onto the cavity of the PCB.\n\nButtons\nAs you might notice, there‚Äôs now three side-buttons, and they are touch sensitive.¬† So it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äúpress‚Äù and no stress is given on the connecting socket, as with top-facing button.With there being more than one button, we plan to leverage multiple gesture for different applications.¬† For example, FIDO2 can require a touch on any button to approve a request (like normal).¬† But by pressing two buttons at once (giving the key a light ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù), this could emit a static password or OTP.\nHigh speed HSM\nOur device will be capable of throughput on the order of 50MB/s, which can enable bulk encryption/decryption operations.¬† Asymmetric operations (like signing) can reach 10-40 operations / second, depending on the algorithm.\nFirmware\nPerhaps the most important, is the actual firmware features on the device.¬† We‚Äôll get into more of this in a future post, but for now, know that we‚Äôre actively working on:* FIDO2* PIV / PKCS#11* Frictionless & secure web-updateAnd it‚Äôs all written in Rust, which provides large safety guarantees and compile time assurance of isolation between apps on the key.\nKeep me updated!\nSign up here!¬† No spam, only will give updates about the new keys.\nName\n\n  Email \n\nHP \n\n  \n\n"

    "Description": "In the litany of copyright infringement lawsuits, technology lawyer and musician Damien Riehl demonstrates that music is merely math, and has a finite number of possible melodies. If you‚Äôve ever thought a song you like sounded similar to another, the culprit may not be an unethical forger, but rather the limited mathematical musical equations that our favorite artists have to work with.  Current copyright law is at risk of severely limiting future music creation and future human creativity. This talk suggests a new way to handle these legal cases.  Damien Riehl is a technology lawyer with a B.S. in music. After beginning to code in 1985, and for the web in 1995, he has worked for the chief judges of state and federal courts; litigated for a decade; taught law-school copyright classes; and led teams in software development, digital forensics, proactive cybersecurity, reactive cybersecurity incidents, and world-scale investigations. Damien‚Äôs combined experience in the law, technology, and music has inspired his most recent project‚Äîcopyrighting billions of unique melodies. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx"

    "Description": "With Appstat, your apps' status, proceeds, and analytics are just one click away. It lives in your Mac's status bar and, when clicked, displays all the apps you have for sale and how much you are making with each one. Once you try Appstat you'll wonder how you ever monitored app sales without it! For App Developers This app only fully functions if you are a developer with an active subscription with Apple. With just a click, Appstat displays all of the following information about your apps: Name and platform, Average proceeds per day (including in-app purchases), Average unit sales per day (including free apps), Bundle identifier and SKU, Your app's website, Original release date and time on the store, Latest version number and time on the store, Rate at which people rate your app (ratings/month), Latest version rating, Overall app rating, Device distribution based on purchases, Country distribution based on purchases, Chart of proceeds over time, Average proceeds per day, Projected proceeds per month and year, Chart of unit sales over time, Latest builds uploaded to TestFlight. All stats are linked to the appropriate section of Apple's developer site, making Appstat a great launchpad. Total store proceeds are also displayed: Average total proceeds per day (and standard deviation), Projected total proceeds per month (estimated using a configurable amount of history), Projected total proceeds per year. Now you can see how you're doing month by month or year by year. They're just projections so take them with a grain of salt! Security and privacy were taken seriously and baked into every step: No usernames or passwords needed! Appstat will never collect these and instead uses API keys generated securely on App Store Connect. All account settings are encrypted locally on your machine for your privacy. Absolutely no data is stored on the machine except those encrypted account settings. Everything is done in-memory and all data is lost when the app is closed. Only uses encrypted communication with Apple servers and never transmits any data to anyone else (especially not me, I don't want it). Doesn't waste battery or network time and fetches data only when you need it. I hope you love it!"
