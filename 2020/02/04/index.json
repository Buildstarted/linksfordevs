    "Description": "The JIT has actual profiles available, which no AOT or prior-profiling technology can do. So yes, which branches branch which way. This lets you decide to e.g. run code down the “hot path” JIT’d and on the “so cold its never taken path” in the interpreter… which means the hot path never has to merge the code-path logic in, which typically cleans out nearly all of the error check & correct logic. But also: which classes are loaded, or not, so typically hundreds of overloadable classes are discovered as overloaded exactly one way, leading to thousands of call sites being statically compiled (and possibly inlined), millions of virtual call invocations removed. Happens very often in large complex frameworks, where key classes are instantiated exactly 1 way based on the programmer picking certain key options at runtime. Also: what to inline, leading to higher resolution profiles on the first tiers of JITing, leading even more aggressively inlined & optimized code down the very specific hot code paths. Also: fields which are always zero, or never set past some point (and not declared final). Any large Java program has thousands of these. You get to treat them as final (or constants), whereas a static profiler-based optimizer cannot. Also: what escapes, and what does not — allowing escape analysis on objects which blatantly escape in a AOT compilation, but which in practice either never escape, or escape extremely rarely. On the rare escape you “inflate” the object as needed. On the non-escape path, the entire object can be “en-registered” - no allocation. There are lots more places where the dynamic profiles are fed back into the JIT, and in my opinion this area remains a fertile ground for future optimizations. Cliff"

    "Description": "From early on in math class, you’re taught that you cannot divide a number by zero. On paper, it doesn’t work out. Do it electronically, and you’ll get an error message. http://goo.gl/K1HGYC\n\nTry do divide by zero with a mechanical calculator and, well, that’s where things get interesting.\n\nYouTuber MultiGlizda recorded the chaos that happens within a Facit ESA-01 mechanical calculator when it’s asked to divide a number by zero. With the case off, viewers are able to see the fascinating inner workings of these old machines in operation, and also demonstrate the dicey nature of the number zero and its division.\n\nYouTube channel numberphile explains that division is based on subtraction; that is, if you want to divide a number by a second number, you just subtract second number from the first number over and over again. So, 20 divided by 5 would be 20 minus 5, which equals 15, minus 5 which equals 10, minus 5 which equals 5, minus 5 which equals 0. Since it took four subtractions to get to zero, the answer is 4. \n\nIt’s a bit of a convoluted way of explaining division, but it helps us understand the video below. You see, when you divide 20 by 0, you’ll end up subtracting 0 from 20 an infinite amount of times. And in the case of the Facit ESA-01 mechanical calculator, what winds up happening is the machine attempts to complete the infinite number of operations it believes is necessary to complete the division."
