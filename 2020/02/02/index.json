I couldn't let 02/02/2020 pass without marking the occasion with a video!\n\nHere are the years which are palindromic dates as well as being palindromic splits in the year for the USA and UK style calendars.\n\n22/01/1022 UK\n01/02/2010 USA\n02/02/2020 UK\n02/02/2020 USA\n09/12/2190 UK\n01/22/2210 USA\n12/09/9021 USA\n12/29/9221 USA\n\nThese are the dates on my sheets:\n\nUSA\n08/31/1380\n10/02/2001\n- 36 years in the 2000s have a palindromic date\n09/22/2290\n10/03/3001\n\nUK\n29/11/1192\n10/02/2001\n- 60 years in the 2000s have a palindromic date\n29/12/2192\n10/03/3001\n\nThe t-shirt(s?) is from the Ugmonk Mountain range. I love their work. https://ugmonk.com/collections/tees/products/mountains-deep-forest?variant=19307947229241\n\nSorry, Think Maths have not made any teacher resources for this video, but check out their resources for all my other videos here: http://think-maths.co.uk/standupmaths-videos\n\nCORRECTIONS\n- I messed up the next palindrome date which works for UK and USA style calendars. We've already had November and OCTOBER (not December which I said) and the next one is December: 12/12/2121. First pointed out by Dr Amy.\n- Typos in description spotted by R Dollarandyou.\n- Let me know if you spot any mistakes! Other than the exposure not matching.\n\nThanks again, as always, for Jane Street being my principal sponsor.\nhttps://www.janestreet.com/\n\nThanks to my Patreon supporters who help make these videos possible. Support my channel and I can make more maths videos:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/standupmaths\n\nFilming and editing by Matt Parker\nMusic by Howard Carter\nDesign by Simon Wright\n\nMATT PARKER: Stand-up Mathematician\nWebsite: http://standupmaths.com/\nMaths book: http://wwwh.umble-pi.com\nNerdy maths toys: http://mathsgear.co.uk/"
