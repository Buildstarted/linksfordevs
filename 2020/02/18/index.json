    "Description": "From ‘dotnet run’ to “Hello World” - Matt Warren\n\nHave you ever stopped to think about all the things that happen when you execute a simple .NET program?\n\nThis talk will delve into the internals of the recently open-sourced .NET Core runtime, looking at what happens, when it happens and why.\n\nMaking use of freely available tools such as 'PerfView', we'll examine the Execution Engine, Type Loader, Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler and the CLR Hosting API to see how all these components play a part in making 'Hello World' possible.\n\n\n\nMatt is a Microsoft MVP based in UK, and a C# dev who loves nothing more than finding and fixing performance issues. He’s worked with Azure, ASP.NET MVC and WinForms on projects for storing government weather data, medical monitoring devices and an inspection system that ensured kegs of beer didn’t leak! He’s previously been an Open Source Contributor to BenchmarkDotNet and RavenDB, nowadays he mostly blogs about the ‘Internals’ of the .NET Runtime at http://mattwarren.org. Matt currently works on the Contrast Security and lives near Pinewood Film Studios (home of James Bond) with his wife and 2 kids.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAbout Pusher Sessions:\r\n\r\nWe're bringing the meetup to you.

Jakub holds a Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Charles University in Prague, where he is also pursuing his PhD.\n\nC# and the .NET Framework have been providing the support for dynamic objects for years already. The reflection API has been improved significantly in .NET Core. So what if we put all this together in order to improve a real dynamic language by running it on top of .NET? The compiler and the runtime have to work together. Also, we have to find a way of implementing the rest of the language’s dynamic features in the most performant way. Let’s talk about how “dynamic” actually started thanks to PHP, how to implement the dynamicity with a custom made compiler on Roslyn, and what are the achievements of such an approach."

How would you even begin?\n\nIn this session, David and Damian from the ASP.NET team will explore what goes into building a SignalR server that can speak to any SignalR client.
