    "Timestamp": "2020-02-12T22:01:39",
    "Domain": "miketuritzin.com",
    "Description": "Overview I developed a technique to render single-pixel particles (using additive blending) with compute shaders rather than the usual fixed-function rasterization with vertex and fragment shaders. My approach runs 25-335% faster than rasterization on the cases I tested and is particularly faster for some “pathological” cases (which for my application are not actually that uncommon). I observed these speedups on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.\nUsing this technique allowed me to ship an app that runs on minimum-spec hardware without sacrificing visual fidelity."
