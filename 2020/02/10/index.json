This paper is a companion paper to a\nkeynote talk at the 2020 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC)\ndiscussing some of the advances in machine learning, and their implications on\nthe kinds of computational devices we need to build, especially in the\npost-Moore's Law-era. It also discusses some of the ways that machine learning\nmay also be able to help with some aspects of the circuit design process.\nFinally, it provides a sketch of at least one interesting direction towards\nmuch larger-scale multi-task models that are sparsely activated and employ much\nmore dynamic, example- and task-based routing than the machine learning models\nof today."

    "Description": "Language is universal, but it has few indisputably universal characteristics, with cross-linguistic variation being the norm. For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates (~39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages’ structural properties and their speakers’ neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture."
