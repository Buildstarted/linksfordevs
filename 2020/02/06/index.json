    "Description": "If you take a look at my Twitter, I have many examples of me showing passion for Windows On ARM. Ever since I started using my ASUS NovaGo that I won at the 2018 Microsoft Build Conference (this totally had to be fate), I’ve been obsessed with finding practical uses for a device running an ARM64 version of Windows 10 that escaped beyond the bounds of mimicking the exact activities I would do from my phone and more like a typical computer. As a developer and someone who loves tinkering with things, I wanted to see what this platform can truly do. Naturally, I did the obvious thing and installed Visual Studio 2019, but was quickly reminded that everything is running through an x86 emulation layer. That meant the act of compiling a .NET Core app was happening from an x86 application. That didn’t make me feel too accomplished. Luckily, I was still able to use .NET Core on ARM64 via WSL – which runs amazingly, but I still wanted to be able to build natively in Windows. So, what did I do to ease my pain? I figured out a way to compile .NET Core for Windows ARM64!"
