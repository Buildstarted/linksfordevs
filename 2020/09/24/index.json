There is no one single way to architect an app. If the app works well, is robust for future expansion, and maintainable - it's architected just fine.\n\nYou can mess things up though. And then everything is terrible.\n\nSo, tune in to this talk to find out about some ways you can go about architecting your Xamarin.Forms app so you don't hate yourself before development of the app is complete.\n\nPresenter: Brandon Minnick, Senior Cloud Advocate, Microsoft"
