This is not an isolated incident as there are several instances in the past where inventions and ideas by black people were stolen.\n\nSo much has changed all over the world, especially in countries where the rights of black people have always been a subject of constant discourse. A 2016 study found that black Americans “apply for patents at nearly half the rate of whites\". This shows that a lot still needs to done to protect the intellectual property rights of black people in tech.\n\nIn my session, I will address the subject of what intellectual property rights are, how they can be protected and what the black community can do to help facilitate this protection. I will speak on the jurisdictional nature of intellectual property rights and why it is important for black people in tech to apply for triadic or international patents.\n---\nMark is a trained lawyer and mediator actively building a career in tech & innovation, corporate practice, intellectual property, dispute resolution, and impact investment.\n\nHe enjoys speaking to people on emerging areas of law, Impact Investment, branding and personal development, startups, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially SDGs 1, 4, 7, 11 and 16.\n\nAs a humanitarian, he volunteered at one of Nigeria's correctional facilities as an ad-hoc lecturer with the National Open Univerisity. He also volunteered with the Legal Aid Council of Nigeria to take on pro bono cases, and DEVATOP to tackle human trafficking.\n\nHe was a judge at the regional rounds of the Philip Jessup International Law Moot Competition.

This session will discuss how the forces that limit Black people’s ability to navigate the physical also prevent us from exerting agency via the digital. Together, we’ll discuss the ways that anti-Blackness is replicated in technology, the discrepancies faced by Black communities due to the digital divide, and the changes required for us to have a more equitable future. Because we can never fully benefit if technology continues to be made for us, without us.\n---\nJacqueline Gibson\nSoftware Engineer focusing on accessibility at Microsoft\n\nJacqueline is a Digital Equity Advocate & Software Engineer building change from the code up. She's interested in leveraging technology for social good, particularly identifying ways in which current technology maintains social inequities and working to eliminate these biases.
