He is challenged by the viewers to use the Peanut Font while coding (http://www.fontriver.com/font/peanut/) and spends 15 minutes in that configuration.  He adds the Pager feature to the FormView along with appropriate integration tests to show it off.\n\n1:22:11 - Would you recommend a novice developer learn command line Git?
