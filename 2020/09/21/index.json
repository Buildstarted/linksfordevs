There's only so much dancing I can do—my knees are getting bad and I am running out of closet space for all these decorations!  \n\nThat said, one of the nicest things about doing these September videos is using the attention as an opportunity to raise money for organizations whose goals I want to champion, whether that's fighting climate change, resources and rights of the unhoused, trans equality &amp; political power, racial justice, reproductive rights, prisoner justice, or a variety of other social goods. So I will keep these September videos going for another year, by challenging you all to help me raise $50,000 for a few select organizations listed here. If we hit $50,000, I'll make another video! If we hit $100,000, uhhh, I'll make another video but also probably freak out because—wow!—that's a lot of money! If we hit $69,420, well...I’ll make another video, and have myself a giggle. (I’m only human.)  Please contribute! Anything helps, even a single dollar! It's a crucial time in our history for so many marginalized and underrepresented voices, and a little bit can go a long way in pushing the needle closer to a socially, politically, and environmentally just world. Thank you so much for your support, I love you!  \n\nP.S.– if you can, VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!  (Thank you to Erik Abriss + Ian Carr of Street Watch LA for helping me set up this fundraiser!) "

Immigrating to the US at the age of 7, Claudius saw how technology vastly improved the lives of Americans. It was then his love for technology was born. Following high school, Claudius pursued his Bachelors Degree in Computer Science while on the Varsity Football team at The Ohio State University. Upon completing his degree he accepted employment at Microsoft in Seattle, WA where he worked as a Software Engineer, largely focusing his time on Voice, Mobile, Cloud, Bots, DevOps, ML/AI, & Blockchain.
