Vote for your favorite with an emote at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz/issues/13\n\nQuestions:\n25:51 - Is it considered bad practice to use a nested class?\n39:20 - When writing methods, is it a rule that they do one thing and one thing only?\n42:15 - How do you create a method with a 'real' optional value?\n44:28 - Can I write a reusable method to do that, so that all of my API calls can reuse that method?\n51:49 - What's a good rule on the number of out parameters vs returning an object with those values instead?\n1:00:33 - Is ref used with value types to change their value within the method?\n1:06:02 - What happens when you assign a new instance of a class to a parameter inside of a method?\n1:12:00 - Are delegates the same as a callback function?\n1:14:40 - If data types are not specified when assigning a delegate, would it automatically infer the type?\n1:25:48 - Can a list of delegates be executed?\n1:30:46 - Is it possible to use a non-void-return-type delegate as the type for an event, and then process the subscriber list with GetInvocationList()?\n1:47:30 - What's the difference between abstract classes and partial classes?\n\nBackground Music is Harris Heller's Streambeats - Synthwave playlist, available royalty free at https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2gjWL0J5SQKceERGJ8Lb5e\nSource code and interactive content from the stream are available at:  https://github.com/csharpfritz/csharp_with_csharpfritz\nWatch live Mondays at 1300 UTC / 9a ET / 6a PT at:  https://twitch.tv/visualstudio"
