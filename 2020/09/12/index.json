    "Description": "The typical app will code split one bundle for each page, as well as a vendor bundle containing a superset of all dependencies used on all pages. The reasoning cited for using this code splitting strategy is that “you will change your own code more often than you will change your dependencies, so you should split it to optimize for caching”. I am personally of the belief this is not true or optimal."

    "Description": "I started a news site for covering the protests in Portland (https://portlandprotestnews.com/), and I wanted to offer a way for people to subscribe to an email newsletter containing the daily posts. My first thought was to set up a MailChimp newsletter, since I already had one set up for another site (https://OrgModeForBeginners.com). However, I quickly realized the first limitation of a free account on MailChimp – only one mailing list allowed – darn! I was not interested in starting to pay $10/month to MailChimp, and it would only bump up to 3 mailing lists. So, I started looking for other free alternatives."
