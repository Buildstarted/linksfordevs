This kind of restriction is a helpful tool both practically and theoretically, but it causes problems when dealing with a rather natural situation where there is long-term dependence between events. The book doesn’t address this, so I tried to, and found out it’s a genuine problem with real research behind it. Here’s what I did."

Maybe the designers’ choice of which response to script is just as interesting to them as a human’s response would be.\nAdults are no less inclined to anthropomorphization—Alexa is marketed as a her and not an it—but they’ve grown used to Alexa’s shortcomings as a conversationalist."
