Most of them are very generally correct. However, I started to think that people are telling those because everyone is telling them. And, most of the people are actually not thinking about exceptional cases. In this post, I will raise my objection against the idea of ‚ÄúSecurity by obscurity is bad‚Äù.\n\nRisk, Defense in Depth and Swiss Cheese\n\nOne of the main goal of defensive security is reducing the risk for the target business. According to the OWASP‚Äôs methodology, the risk of an issue is calculated with the formula below:\n\nRisk = Likelihood * Impact\n\n"
