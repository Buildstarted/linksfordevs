    "Description": "Building and leading communities, one of the common pitfall many people fall in whiles trying to gain grounds in technology has to do with learning every new thing they hear of. It is quite clear that these people think they are doing the right thing until they realize years have passed by and yet they can't build a single project with their knowledge gained. As several people share their stories with me about the same problem, I notice I was in their shoes for my first two years career. In this session, we will address how people who find their self in this category can progress while staying up to date with all new technologies.\n---\nDawood Iddris is a software developer, passionately creating products and changing lives with his soft and technical skills by training others in event, workshops and providing platforms for coders to think beyond the limit.\n\n\nDawood on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Dawoodiddris"

However, what happens when one developer leaves the company?\nIn that case, the public keys of that developer should be removed from all servers."
