The essay makes clear that the things humans make have both intended and unintended consequences. Some of these objects affect society by being built with expressly political design but others are innately political simply by existing and being used. The essay discusses a number of examples such as low overpasses Robert Moses built deliberately to limit public transit from reaching Long Island and hegemonic energy infrastructure such as nuclear vs more decentralized and democratic solar. However, I am interested in viewing this work through the lens of modern information technology and I think a lot of what Winner describes carries forward, the internet itself is a prime example."

Some of the biggest additions landed in the\n3.0 release, but\nwe will also describe some other notable changes from version 2.1 up through\nlatest version."
