I was excited to learn about the community of programmers working together to build things across the internet and it led me to try installing Fedora Core 4 and eventually Ubuntu 6.06, through which I learned a lot about troubleshooting on my own and trying to get things to actually work. This ended up being critical in developing the skills that helped me get the job I have now. I read about Python and wrote trivial programs, and decided I wanted to study computer science and understand how computers actually work. It was a pretty influential post for me at a time when I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do."

However the problem with that is it takes a while to find the exact frames you want, which is annoying when doing a bunch of testing. It also makes it difficult to find out what the variability of latency is like. I had already made this kind of testing easier by adding a mode to my keyboard firmware which changes the LED color after it sends a USB event, but that only made it a bit faster and more precise. I wanted something better."
