This is the result of many people's efforts to Reverse Engineer Wind Waker and craft a program that can take advantage of its structure.\n\nThis video would have not been possible without Peter Schmidt-Nielsen.\nAll the Animations in this video were created by Peter in Javascript using d3, so huge shout out to him for putting in such great work!\n\nFor details about the program, and a list of everyone who worked on this program: https://github.com/petersn/web-sploosh-kaboom"

I was excited to learn about the community of programmers working together to build things across the internet and it led me to try installing Fedora Core 4 and eventually Ubuntu 6.06, through which I learned a lot about troubleshooting on my own and trying to get things to actually work. This ended up being critical in developing the skills that helped me get the job I have now. I read about Python and wrote trivial programs, and decided I wanted to study computer science and understand how computers actually work. It was a pretty influential post for me at a time when I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do."

However the problem with that is it takes a while to find the exact frames you want, which is annoying when doing a bunch of testing. It also makes it difficult to find out what the variability of latency is like. I had already made this kind of testing easier by adding a mode to my keyboard firmware which changes the LED color after it sends a USB event, but that only made it a bit faster and more precise.
