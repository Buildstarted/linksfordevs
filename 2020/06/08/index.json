    "Domain": "docs.microsoft.com",
    "Description": "First, this is a lesson in super-stars. Some background: this was a major change done very late in the game. That's very risk because if you accidentally break something, then regressions mean slipping the product. The change to the CLR was done by Vance Morrison who, in my opinion, is one of the most talented developers on the CLR. (There is nobody on the debugger team, nor has there ever been, who is Vance's equal, and it clearly shows in the mistakes that manifest in the debugger's design and implementation. Although we've have/had promising talent, they've lacked Vance's seniority and experience.)  IMO, the big challenge with changes like this is not so much just writing the code; it's making a broad complicated change which affects many subsystems without breaking anything. It's big, it's complicated, and it has to be done right. This is a great example of the value in having super-stars. In order to do something like this, you need one superstar that can get the job done. You could throw 20 morons on the problem and easily screw it up. This is why people like Michael Jordan got paid so much - he was the superstar that could come through in the clutch.  This is a well known principle. Joel on Software blogs about this here.\n (Additional trivia: When Vance was assessing the impact of this change, he asked me if this would affect the debugger. It turns out there is some minor impact, but we decided the cost-benefit didn't justify a fix. The issue is you can directly use the ICorDebug API to construct nullable types that can't normally exist in the runtime. The details are for another blog entry...)"

If you have not seen it, this is our statement about the current situation: http://fsharpconf.com/BlackLivesMatter/\n\nWe hope that we can spread some good energy by coming together and learning collaboratively.\n\nThis conference aims to be a safe place for everyone who is participating. We ask you to show empathy and compassion for other people and the organizers will not tolerate any kind of hate, discriminatory or racial speech.\n\nThe action will take place on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkYHYKYeNw\n\nThe community conversations will take place directly on YouTube or on the F# Software Foundation Slack. We will announce the appropriate channels during the conference. You need to be a member of the F# Software Foundation (http://foundation.fsharp.org/join) to join the channel (completely free of charge).\n\nWe would love to see people spreading the message. The hashtag on twitter will be #fsharpconf, our handle is @fsharponline.\n\nWe hope to see you around!\n\nRoman, Tomas, Roman and Gien"
