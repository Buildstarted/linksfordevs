A mobile broadband provider\nhas been the rescue, and while they have provided a service reliable as shared\nand wireless services can be, their lack of investment in technology has been\nwhat has bothered me the most. The most prominent effect of the lack of\ntechnology investment was no IPv6 support, which for a communication service\nprovider is a sure way to paint yourself into a corner."

It’s as if it’s in a separate pond from my private one, where any ripples don’t cross the pebbly barrier to the rest of me. I’m still proud of the things I make and still take ownership over code, projects, and problems, but those things are separate from me."
