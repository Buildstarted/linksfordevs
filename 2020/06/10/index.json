    "Description": "Or How To Develop Yourself The Hard Way.\n For a long time I’ve been interested in the topic of feedback—learning from others things that allow us to grow and develop ourselves, as well as improve our cooperation with other people. Recently I’ve been wondering why it’s so rare for people in my culture (Central/Eastern Europe) to share feedback—it’s particularly surprising to me when people struggle finding things to praise for. Giving someone positive feedback feels like such an easy way to do something nice for the person, to make them feel appreciated.\nMy conclusion is that both giving and receiving honest feedback requires us to open up, cut through our armour all the way to our guts and become vulnerable to the other person."
