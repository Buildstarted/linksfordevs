But\nrunning into bug after tricky wireless bug‚Äîmostly while trying to make my video\ncalls work better‚ÄîI‚Äôve apostasized. The more I‚Äôve learned about wifi, Bluetooth\nand related protocols, the more I‚Äôm convinced that they‚Äôre often worse, on net,\nthan wires.\n\nFor instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet\nservice provider. That‚Äôs understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced\noligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However,\nevery time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their\nconnection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the\neasiest fix has been to run a cable.\n\nWifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they ‚Äújust\nwork.‚Äù But if you investigate, you‚Äôll often find that the wireless link is\noperating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent.\nSince this degradation is silent, it‚Äôs often not obvious that the problem is the\nwireless‚Äîinstead, you‚Äôll probably conclude that it‚Äôs your device/software/self.\n\nOver and over again, I‚Äôve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go \n‚Äúwow, I had no idea how much better this could be!\"\n\nFig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.\nRecently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk‚Äôs wireless devices with\nwired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and\nbreak my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the\nsame level of tidiness, with much better reliability, quality and speed. I no\nlonger have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery,\nor spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk.
