To the neighbors' surprise, no drugs were found in the “Sheltuh,” just a recording studio in the basement."

But\nrunning into bug after tricky wireless bug—mostly while trying to make my video\ncalls work better—I’ve apostasized. The more I’ve learned about wifi, Bluetooth\nand related protocols, the more I’m convinced that they’re often worse, on net,\nthan wires.\n\nFor instance: most people, when their video call stutters, blame their Internet\nservice provider. That’s understandable, since most ISPs are overpriced\noligopolists with barely-usable software and horrible customer service. However,\nevery time I can remember helping someone track down the source of their\nconnection problems, the culprit has turned out to be their wifi. And often, the\neasiest fix has been to run a cable.\n\nWifi (and bluetooth, etc.) sucker you in by making it seem like they “just\nwork.” But if you investigate, you’ll often find that the wireless link is\noperating in a degraded state that performs much worse than a wired equivalent.\nSince this degradation is silent, it’s often not obvious that the problem is the\nwireless—instead, you’ll probably conclude that it’s your device/software/self.\n\nOver and over again, I’ve seen people fix some wireless-related problem and go \n“wow, I had no idea how much better this could be!\"\n\nFig. 1a: managed cables on my desk.Fig. 1b: less-managed cables underneath.\nRecently, I finally ragequit and replaced all my desk’s wireless devices with\nwired ones. While I had to invest a bit in figuring out cable management (and\nbreak my habit of chewing on headphone cables), I was able to achieve nearly the\nsame level of tidiness, with much better reliability, quality and speed. I no\nlonger have to worry about my equipment failing to pair, running out of battery,\nor spontaneously giving me garbled robot voice during a livestreamed talk. It’s\ndramatically reduced my level of device-related agony.\n\nTo illustrate the degree of agony I’m"
