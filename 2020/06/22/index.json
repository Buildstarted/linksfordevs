    "Domain": "yizhang82.dev",
    "Description": "Overview I’ve been doing some research in this area trying to understand how this works in databases (for my upcoming project), so I thought I’d share some of my learnings here. InnoDB internally uses ReadView to establish snapshots for consistent reads - basically giving you the point-in-time view of the database at the time when the snapshot it is created. In InnoDB, all changes are immediately made on the latest version of Database regardless whether it has been committed or not, so if you don’t have MVCC, everybody will see the latest version of rows and it’ll be a disaster for consistency. Not to mention you’ll need to be able to rollback the changes. In order to achieve this, InnoDB maintains a undo log to track a link list of changes made by other transactions, so reading in the past with a snapshot means going from the latest record in the BufferPool, and walk backwards to find the first visible change. Rollback is similar. This also means the undo log can’t be purged if the snapshot is still active, and undo log will get longer and longer, which slows down the reads more and more. This is the infamous long running transaction issue. The fundamental issue is that you need to be able to determine visibility of changes. This is done with two things: InnoDB tracks the trx_id_t of each rows and in the undo log InnoDB internally use a data structure called ReadView to determine if a transaction is visible in the snapshot. So the algorithm becomes as simple as walking the list backwards and find the first visible record."

A resume is typically only a single page long and\nshould provide all information pertinent to a very specific job. A CV,\nby contrast, can be any length and usually contains all details\npertinent to your professional life."
