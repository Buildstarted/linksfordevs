    "Description": "The use of the structural similarity index (SSIM) is widespread. For almost\ntwo decades, it has played a major role in image quality assessment in many\ndifferent research disciplines. Clearly, its merits are indisputable in the\nresearch community. However, little deep scrutiny of this index has been\nperformed. Contrary to popular belief, there are some interesting properties of\nSSIM that merit such scrutiny. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical\nfactors of SSIM and show that it can generate results, in both synthetic and\nrealistic use cases, that are unexpected, sometimes undefined, and\nnonintuitive. As a consequence, assessing image quality based on SSIM can lead\nto incorrect conclusions and using SSIM as a loss function for deep learning\ncan guide neural network training in the wrong direction."

Since WebAssembly code is running inside browser’s JavaScript context, the answer is “Yes” and it is actually quite simple to do it. In this article we will explore how you can create interoperability (interop) between Uno-WASM managed code and JavaScript context of an application. The two sample apps with code we provide will help you understand how to use the integration in actual application code. For the purpose of the examples we will create an application using a well known date/time picker control called Flartpickr as well as syntax visualizer called PrismJS. In the end you will generate applications looking like this:   Leveraging the Uno.WASM Bootstrapper At the heart of Uno-WASM, there’s a package called Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap (Uno Bootstrapper) project. It contains the tooling required to build, package, deploy, run and debug a .NET project in a web browser using WebAssembly.

    "Description": "In a previous post I mentioned the Industrial Revolution as a good early example of exploitation of workers for the benefit of industry owners. Naturally, this wasn’t the first or only time this happened1. The Industrial Revolution, however, is specifically an example of technologies driving out the workers, while their marketing suggested otherwise. The hope was that technological improvements were supposed to make life easier, to decrease manufacturing costs, therefore increasing resources for the people. Of course, that never happened: the income flowed to the owners and founders, then due to competition and product pricing adjustments - into the ether, though we can speculate that theoretically the better price point did help the people in the end. Just one example is society in the Russian Empire, which was basically split into two classes: landowners and peasants. Moving up from peasantry was practically impossible. For those interested in the subject, I strongly recommend Lev Tolstoy’s works: namely, Anna Karenina, but also War and Peace. Both were written in mid to late 19th century and are not only a pleasure to read, but portray the sequence of events leading up to our revolutions. ↩"
