Further, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is almost double of other people, and the people with disabilities who are employed have lower earnings, in general.\n\nThis means we have an opportunity and a duty to empower Black people with technology. One of the most powerful ways we can do this is to make our messaging accessible—no matter the platform or media.\n\nWhile many of us have heard that accessibility is important, we seldom hear about how to implement it in our everyday work. Angela will discuss how people in every discipline—including PMs, content writers, designers, engineers, and more—can do so and further amplify the voices of Black people.\n---\nAngela Hooker is a Senior Accessibility Program Manager at Microsoft, where she's built a center of expertise for accessibility, user experience, and universal design. She's brought her web management, development, design, accessibility, and editorial and content management expertise to the government and private sector for over 20 years.\n\nAngela also advocates for role-based accessibility and believes that teaching people how to incorporate principles of accessibility in their everyday work creates a sustainable program and produces the most accessible user experiences. Angela speaks on and writes about accessibility, disability, user experience, and plain language."

Community involvement can be anything from Open Source Contributions, Writing articles, answering questions on social media/StackOverflow to speaking at conferences. Participation in your community will expand your network.\n\nBy attending small meetups or having conversations in slack channels will lead you to meet new people in your industry. Sharing will increase your visibility in the ecosystem by Founders, people of related skill sets, recruiters, and more.\n\nThere isn’t just one way to share your expertise with your community. Open Source Contributions isn't just code, you can write articles/documentation about the product you would like to contribute to about your experiences or speak at conferences. Collaboration helps you to be seen as a leader in your community. You can collaborate with others in your network by mentoring, organizing an event, or working together on a personal project/ideas\n\nI learned most of the things I know today about the community the hard way because I never saw it as anything important, and all I cared about was just write the code and today I am a Senior Developer Advocate at Fleek, and also the lead organizer of some major communities in Africa which included, unStack, Developers Circles Lagos from Facebook, Open Source Community Africa, NaijaHacks, and AfricaHacks.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n1) Attendees will learn how to build a community on their own\n2) Attendees will learn how open-source works in a community\n3) Attendees will learn how to contribute to ideas to a community\n\n----------------\n\nShodipo Ayomide is a Developer Advocate, Engineer, and Occasional Designer, who also contributes to a lot of open-source projects over on GitHub, he also runs some major communities like unStack, Developers Circles Lagos from Facebook, Open Source Community Africa and NaijaHacks driving Nigeria & Africa forward in Technology, he is an international speaker who has spoken at a lot of conferences over time in various locations, in his free time he loves to, Read, See a Movie and Occasionally play video games, Loves Travelling and Family."
