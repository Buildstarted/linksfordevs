I am very proud and honoured to have been involved with it and a massive thank you to Andreas Håkansson for teaching me plenty via the 1:1 Skype calls we had in the early days.  As many of you also know I created Carter which in my mind was Nancy v2 but sat on top of ASP.NET Core with the same approaches as Nancy, offering many things a web framework should have.  The usage of Carter has steadily increased which is good to know people value similar things we achieved with Nancy.  However, paradoxically I have had a feeling brewing for sometime that this effort is almost futile."

But Stonebraker was never a coder, and he stayed\nout of the way of his development team. The Postgres codebase was the work of a\nteam of brilliant students and the occasional university \"staff programmers\"\nwho had little more experience (and only slightly more compensation) than the\nstudents. I was lucky to join that team as a student during the latter years of\nthe project. I got helpful input on this writeup from some of the more senior\nstudents on the project, but any errors or omissions are mine. If you spot any\nsuch, please contact me and I will try to fix them."
