Rumors are it’s extremely solid for a piece of hardware that’s far below the “bargain” price range and into the “fell off the back of a truck” pile. However, I recently read someone complaining that there’s been lots of “fresh new user” blog posts and no “how does this actually work six months in” write-ups. It just so happens that I’ve had my Pinebook Pro as my main laptop for nearly six months now, so I thought I’d write up my experiences with it so far."

It happens if you synchronously wait on an asynchronous operation result with the help of .Result, .Wait or similar. Why is it bad? First of all, it blocks (wastes) one thread to wait on a result – which may lead to threads starvation. But even worse, it may deadlock your operation and (sometimes) the whole application."

My first thought: this was a perfect candidate for feature flags (or feature toggles). This allows you to merge code into a production branch, but only enable when ready.
