Rumors are it’s extremely solid for a piece of hardware that’s far below the “bargain” price range and into the “fell off the back of a truck” pile. However, I recently read someone complaining that there’s been lots of “fresh new user” blog posts and no “how does this actually work six months in” write-ups. It just so happens that I’ve had my Pinebook Pro as my main laptop for nearly six months now, so I thought I’d write up my experiences with it so far."

First of all, it blocks (wastes) one thread to wait on a result – which may lead to threads starvation. But even worse, it may deadlock your operation and (sometimes) the whole application."
