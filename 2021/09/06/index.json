    "Description": "Merge NTFSv3 filesystem from Konstantin Komarov:\n \"This patch adds NTFS Read-Write driver to fs/ntfs3.\n\n  Having decades of expertise in commercial file systems development and\n  huge test coverage, we at Paragon Software GmbH want to make our\n  contribution to the Open Source Community by providing implementation\n  of NTFS Read-Write driver for the Linux Kernel.\n\n  This is fully functional NTFS Read-Write driver. Current version works\n  with NTFS (including v3.1) and normal/compressed/sparse files and\n  supports journal replaying.\n\n  We plan to support this version after the codebase once merged, and\n  add new features and fix bugs. For example, full journaling support\n  over JBD will be added in later updates\"\n\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210729134943.778917-1-almaz.alexandrovich@paragon-software.com/\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/aa4aa155-b9b2-9099-b7a2-349d8d9d8fbd@paragon-software.com/\n\n* git://github.com/Paragon-Software-Group/linux-ntfs3: (35 commits)\n  fs/ntfs3: Change how module init/info messages are displayed\n  fs/ntfs3: Remove GPL boilerplates from decompress lib files\n  fs/ntfs3: Remove unnecessary condition checking from ntfs_file_read_iter\n  fs/ntfs3: Fix integer overflow in ni_fiemap with fiemap_prep()\n  fs/ntfs3: Restyle comments to better align with kernel-doc\n  fs/ntfs3: Rework file operations\n  fs/ntfs3: Remove fat ioctl's from ntfs3 driver for now\n  fs/ntfs3: Restyle comments to better align with kernel-doc\n  fs/ntfs3: Fix error handling in indx_insert_into_root()\n  fs/ntfs3: Potential NULL dereference in hdr_find_split()\n  fs/ntfs3: Fix error code in indx_add_allocate()\n  fs/ntfs3: fix an error code in ntfs_get_acl_ex()\n  fs/ntfs3: add checks for allocation failure\n  fs/ntfs3: Use kcalloc/kmalloc_array over kzalloc/kmalloc\n  fs/ntfs3: Do not use driver own alloc wrappers\n  fs/ntfs3: Use kernel ALIGN macros over driver specific\n  fs/ntfs3: Restyle comment block in ni_parse_reparse()\n  fs/ntfs3: Remove unused including <linux/version.h>\n  fs/ntfs3: Fix fall-through warnings for Clang\n  fs/ntfs3: Fix one none utf8 char in source file\n  ..."
