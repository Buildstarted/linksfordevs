    "Description": "We present evidence that in‚Äâ~‚Äâ1650 BCE (~‚Äâ3600¬†years ago), a cosmic airburst destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a Middle-Bronze-Age city in the southern Jordan Valley northeast of the Dead Sea. The proposed airburst was larger than the 1908 explosion over Tunguska, Russia, where a‚Äâ~‚Äâ50-m-wide bolide detonated with‚Äâ~‚Äâ1000√ó‚Äâmore energy than the Hiroshima atomic bomb. A city-wide‚Äâ~‚Äâ1.5-m-thick carbon-and-ash-rich destruction layer contains peak concentrations of shocked quartz (~‚Äâ5‚Äì10¬†GPa); melted pottery and mudbricks; diamond-like carbon; soot; Fe- and Si-rich spherules; CaCO3 spherules from melted plaster; and melted platinum, iridium, nickel, gold, silver, zircon, chromite, and quartz. Heating experiments indicate temperatures exceeded 2000¬†¬∞C. Amid city-side devastation, the airburst demolished 12+‚Äâm of the 4-to-5-story palace complex and the massive 4-m-thick mudbrick rampart, while causing extreme disarticulation and skeletal fragmentation in nearby humans. An airburst-related influx of salt (~‚Äâ4¬†wt.%) produced hypersalinity, inhibited agriculture, and caused a‚Äâ~‚Äâ300‚Äì600-year-long abandonment of‚Äâ~‚Äâ120 regional settlements within a‚Äâ>‚Äâ25-km radius. Tall el-Hammam may be the second oldest city/town destroyed by a cosmic airburst/impact, after Abu Hureyra, Syria, and possibly the earliest site with an oral tradition that was written down (Genesis). Tunguska-scale airbursts can devastate entire cities/regions and thus, pose a severe modern-day hazard."
