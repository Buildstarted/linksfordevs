    "Description": "For the first time, a large high-temperature superconducting electromagnet was ramped to a field strength of 20 tesla, the most powerful magnetic field of its kind ever created. The demonstration helps resolve the greatest uncertainty in the quest to build the first fusion power plant that can produce more energy than it consumes, according to project leaders at MIT and startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS)."
