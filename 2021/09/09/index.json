We have added command-line details, app pool details, parent/child process tree view, and the Select running window from the desktop option in the attach to process dialog. This makes it convenient to find the right process you need to attach. Also, the Attach to Process dialog is now asynchronous, making it interactive even when the process list is updating. All these features should be available in the latest Visual Studio 2022 preview version."
