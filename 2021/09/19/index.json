Keeping your application up with the latest version of .NET can be challenging. There are budgets to consider, time to learn the differences, and time to ‚Äúfit in the migration.‚Äù Migrating or ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù an ASP.NET MVC from .NET Framework to ASP.NET Core can be easy at times. Other times it can be just hard. There are no silver bullets to the migration as each project and solution is different. I‚Äôm going to walk you through one of the ways you can have a successful migration from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Core MVC. At the end of the post, I‚Äôll show you some gotchas that I have run across migrating applications."
