    "Domain": "explained.ai",
    "Description": "Decision trees are the fundamental building block of gradient boosting machines and Random Forests(tm), probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data. Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models. Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn't find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. So, we've created a general package (part of the animl library) for scikit-learn decision tree visualization and model interpretation."

This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state."
