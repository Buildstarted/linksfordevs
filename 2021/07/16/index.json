    "Description": "Wouldn't it be great if you could pick up a device and start coding on your project, without having to configure your environment and dependencies every time you switch device? You can with GitHub Codespaces (opens new window). Codespaces provides development environments in the cloud that you can access from anywhere with a browser, through VS Code (opens new window) and with Visual Studio (opens new window). This enables you to start development quickly, because the codespace contains all the dependencies, extensions and configuration that you need. And allows you to develop your software on thin-clients, like tablets and less powerful computers, because the cloud provides the compute power to crunch the code and compile, run and debug it."
