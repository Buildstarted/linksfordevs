    "Description": "Startup founders need to do two things: (1) figure out what to do, (2) do it.\n(I suppose that applies to anyone, but I'm writing about founders). My beef\nwith \"move fast\" is that I don't naturally associate it with figuring out what\nto do. To me, \"move\" is physical, outward, observable. Shipping features and\ntalking to people... but not thinking. If I spent a day thinking, trying to\nbetter understand a problem, I wouldn't view myself as having \"moved fast\" that\nday. And that's a real shame, at least if \"good founders move fast\" is true."
