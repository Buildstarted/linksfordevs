You can use this to analyze if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. And to get a more advanced analysis, you can use the opinion mining feature of sentiment analysis (opens new window), which analyzes a sentence on a deeper level and can identify multiple different sentiments in a sentence. For instance, the sentence \"I love spicy food, but I hate how it makes me feel\", is both positive and negative. Opinion mining can detect those sentiments."

Shipping features and\ntalking to people... but not thinking. If I spent a day thinking, trying to\nbetter understand a problem, I wouldn't view myself as having \"moved fast\" that\nday.
