    "Description": "The Azure Cognitive Services Text Analytics API (opens new window) provides the sentiment analysis feature. You can use this to analyze if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. And to get a more advanced analysis, you can use the opinion mining feature of sentiment analysis (opens new window), which analyzes a sentence on a deeper level and can identify multiple different sentiments in a sentence. For instance, the sentence \"I love spicy food, but I hate how it makes me feel\", is both positive and negative. Opinion mining can detect those sentiments."

My beef\nwith \"move fast\" is that I don't naturally associate it with figuring out what\nto do. To me, \"move\" is physical, outward, observable. Shipping features and\ntalking to people... but not thinking. If I spent a day thinking, trying to\nbetter understand a problem, I wouldn't view myself as having \"moved fast\" that\nday. And that's a real shame, at least if \"good founders move fast\" is true."
