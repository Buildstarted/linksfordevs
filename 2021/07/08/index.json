Unfortunately, the discussion often centers on problems already fixed by current tools, but the solutions are still unknown for many practitioners. This post shows how to overcome some of Jupyter notebook’s limitations, proposes a workflow to streamline their use in production, and discusses problems that remain to be solved."
