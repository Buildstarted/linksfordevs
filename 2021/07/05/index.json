Caching can improve the performance and scalability of an app, especially when the app is hosted by a cloud service or a server farm. In this implementation, you will be implementing distributed caching using SQL Server. In asp.net core distributed caching can be implemented with the help of IDistributedCache interface - you can start with MemoryCache in the development and in production you can switch to SQL Server or Redis or any other provider which implements IDistributedCache interface."
