    "Description": "I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the Nix package manager to install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without installing Homebrew. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.\nWhy Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?) The short answer: hype."
