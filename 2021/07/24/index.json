    "Description": "Records were a new feature introduced in C# 9 that allow concise definition of immutable data classes that you may have already seen or even used. In order to support them there were also related new concepts introduced like \"primary constructors\", \"init accessors\" and \"with expressions\", and there are also some traps with records that you should be aware of, like for example I probably shouldn't have referred to them as \"immutable data classes\"."
