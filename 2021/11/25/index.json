    "Description": "JDK 17 has been out for a few months and itâ€™s not just packed with new language features. The performance boost compared to older JDK versions is also really significant. It becomes especially clear when compared to the previous LTS releases, JDK 8 and JDK 11. Much of the improved performance comes from new features and optimizations in the JVM and in this post the focus will be on the improvements done in the area of garbage collection."
