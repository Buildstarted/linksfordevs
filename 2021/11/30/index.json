    "Description": "Traditional quantile estimators that are based on one or two order statistics\nare a common way to estimate distribution quantiles based on the given samples.\nThese estimators are robust, but their statistical efficiency is not always\ngood enough. A more efficient alternative is the Harrell-Davis quantile\nestimator which uses a weighted sum of all order statistics. Whereas this\napproach provides more accurate estimations for the light-tailed distributions,\nit's not robust. To be able to customize the trade-off between statistical\nefficiency and robustness, we could consider a trimmed modification of the\nHarrell-Davis quantile estimator. In this approach, we discard order statistics\nwith low weights according to the highest density interval of the beta\ndistribution."
