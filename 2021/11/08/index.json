    "Domain": "seankilleen.com",
    "Description": "Google Sheets is a phenomenal tool for group collaboration, but occasionally I wish it could do a little bit more.  Recently, I had 400+ links with their full URLs in a spreadsheet – and reader, they were messy looking. I figured it would be nicer to have a link text of “Link” that points to the URL, rather than the URL itself.  How I did it  You’ll repeat this process twice, one for each macro you want.     Open the Google Sheet   Click Tools --> Macro --> Record Macro:        Save the Macro with a Name and keyboard shortcut:        Click to edit the script:     If you miss it, you can click the script editor from the menu:       Replace the contents of that function with the contents of this function to shorten links:   // Sets link text to \"Link\" in current cell function ShortenHyperlinkText() {   var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();   var currentText = spreadsheet.getCurrentCell().getRichTextValue().getText();      spreadsheet.getCurrentCell().setRichTextValue(SpreadsheetApp.newRichTextValue()   .setText('Link')   .setLinkUrl(currentText)   .build()); };   Or this function to expand links:  // Sets link text to the full URL function ElongateHyperlinkText() {   var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();   var currentLinkText = spreadsheet.getCurrentCell().getRichTextValue().getLinkUrl();    spreadsheet.getCurrentCell().setRichTextValue(SpreadsheetApp.newRichTextValue()   .setText(currentLinkText)   .build()); };   Caveats     Use at your own risk etc. etc. (luckily, if you change anything you don’t want changed, you should be able to undo it.)   This doesn’t work on a range of highlighted cells. For this particular script, you have to highlight the cell with the link text and then run the macro.   This assumes that when you run the shortener, you have a link. It also assumes that when you elongate a cell with a link, it actually has a link.   It’s pretty rudimentary, but it helped me out in a pinch so I figured I’d share."
