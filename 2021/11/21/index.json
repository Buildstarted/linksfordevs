It’s basically a wrapper around cURL that allows you to write a handful of HTTP requests into a single plaintext file and execute them. You can then add assertions for responses and also pass data from one response to follow-up requests."

As a former Uber manager his posts and insights are always extremely interesting to read. Some of the topics are geared towards senior ICs or people who are on track to become managers or who have more people responsibilities than a standard IC, but, at least recently, I’ve found for myself that you can always take away something valuable from such articles, even if you aren’t yet at that level. \nThis is a bit in-line with the Stackoverflow article about growing by doing stretch assignments.\n\n"
