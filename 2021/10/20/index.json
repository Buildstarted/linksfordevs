You can deploy it to Azure App Service using FTP, since there is no compilation steps required. If you‚Äôre using Composer - Dependency Manager for PHP, you need to run the composer install before deploying the files to app service via FTP. Instead of using deploying FTP deploy the app, I choose to implement a deployment pipeline, so that I don‚Äôt want to share the FTP credentials to the developer. And if I enable continuous integration - when ever developer commit some changes, can be deployed automatically to the app service."
