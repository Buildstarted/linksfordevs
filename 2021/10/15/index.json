However, many tech workers have no idea what their labor is worth on the open market. There‚Äôs a huge information asymmetry here: employers have access to detailed industry data on salaries, but workers don‚Äôt. In this article, I‚Äôll share a method people can use to determine the ‚Äúmarket rate‚Äù for their skills. I‚Äôve developed this method over the last six months, as I‚Äôve helped nearly 100 people figure out their worth. Feedback has been that this is pretty accurate, so I‚Äôm sharing the technique here so you can use it to determine what your labor is worth."
