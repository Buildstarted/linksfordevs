    "Description": "Salaries in tech are going up, and many people are looking for new jobs or reevaluating the ones they have. However, many tech workers have no idea what their labor is worth on the open market. There’s a huge information asymmetry here: employers have access to detailed industry data on salaries, but workers don’t. In this article, I’ll share a method people can use to determine the “market rate” for their skills. I’ve developed this method over the last six months, as I’ve helped nearly 100 people figure out their worth. Feedback has been that this is pretty accurate, so I’m sharing the technique here so you can use it to determine what your labor is worth."
