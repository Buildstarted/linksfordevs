This book teaches how to solve technical problems, step by step.\nLearn practice methods, how to acquire technique and memorize hours of\nrepertoire, sight reading, musical playing, relaxation, etc., and, most\nimportantly, Mental Play in which you learn to play the piano in your mind.\nMental play touches every aspect of piano playing, from memorizing, controlling\nnervousness, developing performance skills, playing musically, etc., to\nacquiring absolute pitch, composing and improvisation. It is almost\nunbelievable that such an essential skill has been mostly neglected by piano\nteachers. All great musicians used it, yet even they often failed to teach it.\nWe learn why the traditional methods of teaching piano widely used today are\nthe reasons why students give up piano."
