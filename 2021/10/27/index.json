By cracking here, we mean that we can predict the sequence of the random numbers using previously generated numbers without the knowledge of the seed. We started by breaking a simple PRNG, namely XORShift, following the lead of the post published in [1]. We simplified the structure of the neural network model from the one proposed in that post. Also, we have achieved a higher accuracy. This blog aims to show how to train a machine learning model that can reach 100% accuracy in generating random numbers without knowing the seed. And we also deep dive into the trained model to show how it worked and extract useful information from it."
