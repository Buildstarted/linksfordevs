In other words: don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel; stand on the shoulders of giants. I very often follow this rule of thumb. But last week, I broke that rule and wrote an F# implementation of the OSC (Open Sound Control) protocol1.                 Um, ackshually, it‚Äôs a content format, not a protocol‚Ä¶ Yes, I know, dear reader, and they spell this out in [the OSC 1.1 spec][osc-1.1]. I called it that for sake of simplicity. Calling it a ‚Äúcontent format‚Äù may be more correct, but I think ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù gives a better connotation in that opening paragraph. You may notice that I more correctly use the ‚Äúcontent format‚Äù description later on. Whatever, go ahead and crucify me for that if you‚Äôre feeling particularly pedantic today.
