There are many approaches to this problem, but they all have significant downsides."

    "Description": "If you are a technology leader, you know you make decisions, big or small, all the time. You also know that each decision carries some risk. Risks arise from several sources. We know how to mitigate many of the sources, but one of them is insidious: uncertainty due to lack of information. Behavioral phychologists and economists have spent decades researching how humans make decisions under uncertainty, and have found that a very wide variety of errors in decisions arise due to a few—just three, in fact—mental shortcuts humans use on a daily basis. These shortcuts, while useful in some circumstances, create systematic and even predictable errors. Sadly, we are largely unaware we are using them. In this article I will discuss what we know about how humans deal with uncertainty intuitively, the kinds of errors this can create, and how to identify and stop the mental shortcuts that can lead us to make errors. I hope this will help you increase the quality of your decisions and reduce risk, with only a little effort."
