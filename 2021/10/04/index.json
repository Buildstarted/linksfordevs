    "Description": "C++17 introduced std::optional<T> which lets you augment the values of a type T with a bonus value known as std::nullopt which semantically represents the absence of a value. A std::optional which holds the value std::nullopt is known as empty. The basic operations on std::optional are Checking if it holds a value (has_value()) Retrieving the value (value()) Assigning a value (=) Clearing the value and returning to the empty state (reset()) There are other lesser-known powers of the std::optional."
