We're looking for someone passionate about communicating with our developer community to understand their needs and where Akita can be most valuable. What is Akita? What part of my system is falling down? Why is my endpoint slow? What services am I calling? Today, answering these questions requires developers to dig into logs, metrics, and traces—and this scavenger hunt is only if you're lucky enough to have observability installed! At Akita, we're building the first API-centric observability platform to make observability accessible for all developers. Two of the coolest parts of Akita's approach are 1) the ability to observe system behavior simply by dropping in and watching API traffic and 2)"
