Bastion doesn't require the VM to have a public IP address, as it connects to your VM using the RDP or SSH protocol over TLS, using your VMs private IP address. All you need is an Azure Bastion resource and an HTML5 capable web client. Because you do not need to expose your Virtual Machines to the public Internet, your VMs are protected against port scanning by rogue and malicious users located outside your virtual network."
