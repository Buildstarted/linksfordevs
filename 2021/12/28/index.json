    "Description": "I&rsquo;ve long thought that Zig was an interesting programming language, potentially more interesting than Rust in many respects given that Zig seems to be targetting a more modern C-like language replacement whereas Rust firmly looks like it is trying to take C++ out back like ol' yeller. Rust is powerful, but the language is complicated, and no I&rsquo;m not talking about the borrow-checker (a completely genius idea) but the language itself is vast and complex."
