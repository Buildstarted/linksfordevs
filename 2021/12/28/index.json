    "Description": "The James Webb Space Telescope probably needs no introduction, since it is perhaps the most important and well-known mission of the last years. It was launched on Christmas day from Kourou, French Guiana, into a direct transfer orbit to the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point. JWST uses S-band at 2270.5 MHz to transmit telemetry. The science data will be transmitted in K-band at 29.5 GHz, with a rate of up to 28 Mbps."

My green card was finally issued in 2021, which means that I didn’t have to scramble to find a new job in forty days. For the first time in the fifteen years I have lived abroad, I could finally take my time without fear of getting on the bad side of immigration authorities. As someone who has been on a work visa for the last fifteen years of my life, this was wild."
