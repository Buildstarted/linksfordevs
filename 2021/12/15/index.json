    "Description": "Last time we perambulated on telephones, we discussed open-wire long-distance\ntelephone carriers and touched on carriers intended for cables. Recall that, in\nthe telephone industry, cable refers to an assembly of multiple copper twisted\npairs (often hundreds) in a single jacket. There is a surprising amount of\ncomplexity to the detailed design of cables, but that's the general idea.\nCables were not especially popular for long-distance service because the close\nproximity of the pairs always lead to crosstalk problems. Open-wire was much\nbetter in that regard but it was costly to install and maintain, and the large\nphysical size of open-wire arrays limited the channel capacity of long-distance\nleads."
