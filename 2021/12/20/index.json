    "Description": "No — exa has, in my opinion, much saner defaults than ls, so while the available command-line options are similar, they are not exactly the same. Most of the common options will work consistently, though. For example, exa prints human-readable file sizes by default, so the -h option no longer applies."

    "Domain": "mihaisplace.blog",
    "Description": "After reading various books, essays, and blog posts on what it takes to build a startup I've decided to create a step-by-step guide for it that is all-encompassing. Note that this content is heavily influenced by Lean Startup thinking and Running Lean by Ash Maurya, which in my opinion are the best books on succeeding with startup projects as a bootstrapper. A bootstrapper is someone who builds quickly themselves or with a small team and takes as little capital as they can in the early stages. I realize that there is some bias here as there are many other philosophies to building a startup in regards to investors, hard-tech, research projects, or geographical location. I believe that US-based tech founders who don't mind being technical, and funding their startup without taking too much initial capital will deeply resonate with this guide. For everyone else, I'm sure there is something for you here as well, though one or two of the steps may not apply to you or be relevant."

    "Description": "In this article, I will show you an easy-to-use, simple, and non-disruptive way to extend a GNU bash script by a few lines that can help make sense of its execution flow at runtime a fair bit easier. Using this method will also allow you to effortlessly add a “verbose” execution mode to scripts you create or extend. It also improves the usefulness of set -x aka xtrace mode. The method is compatible with zsh, and maybe also other advanced Bourne-style shells."

Great programmers are creative workers and problem-solvers and one of their most important traits is: never stop learning &ndash; but getting stuck in its own comfort zone and becoming reluctant to change is deeply wired into human nature (Humans are hard-wired to follow the path of least resistance)."
