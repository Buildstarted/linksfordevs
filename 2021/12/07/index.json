This writeup therefore pains me, as I usually don’t have anything negative to say about CF, but after some months in <em>production</em>, and a severe lack of any meaningful reply from the CF Images team addressing any of these concerns (you won’t find a single official response in any of the linked community posts), I find it necessary to inform about some aspects of CF Images that I frankly find both surprising, concerning and disappointing. I will update this list when issues have been addressed.</p>"
