It would not be unreasonable for the French intelligence services to assume that there was a measure of Israeli spying on France involved here, with or without the knowledge of the Moroccans. Macron, in a phone conversation with Israel‚Äôs prime minister Naftali Bennett, pointedly asked for an¬†explanation."
