Scott is the Director of Program Management for .NET at Microsoft.&nbsp; &nbsp; When Scott first joined Microsoft back in 2007, he was working on the ASP.NET team. As the Director of Program Management of .NET, Scott and his team build .NET Core, .NET Framework, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, managed languages (C#/F#/VB), as well as the Web and .NET Tooling for Visual Studio. &nbsp; The last time Scott was on the podcast, he and Jeffrey spoke about .NET 5. Now, less than a year later, the release of .NET 6 is coming up. In this episode, Scott speaks about the changes that he and his team have been working on developing, what developers should currently be paying attention to in preparation for the release of .NET 6, the biggest changes from .NET 5 to .NET 6 that developers can look forward to, and his insights on .NET MAUI, C# 10.0, .NET Upgrade Assistant, Visual Studio 2022, and more! If you’re a developer awaiting the release of .NET 6 or are currently experimenting with .NET 5, you should be tuning in to today’s conversation! &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:14] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups.

    "Description": "Humans’ ability to efficiently shed heat has enabled us to range over every continent, but a wet-bulb temperature (TW) of 35°C marks our upper physiological limit, and much lower values have serious health and productivity impacts. Climate models project the first 35°C TW occurrences by the mid-21st century. However, a comprehensive evaluation of weather station data shows that some coastal subtropical locations have already reported a TW of 35°C and that extreme humid heat overall has more than doubled in frequency since 1979. Recent exceedances of 35°C in global maximum sea surface temperature provide further support for the validity of these dangerously high TW values. We find the most extreme humid heat is highly localized in both space and time and is correspondingly substantially underestimated in reanalysis products. Our findings thus underscore the serious challenge posed by humid heat that is more intense than previously reported and increasingly severe."
