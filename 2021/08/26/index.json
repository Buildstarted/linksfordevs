You import API definitions into Azure API Management and create a facade API that users communicate with. This allows you to create products (opens new window) for your API, and monitor and manage API usage and access with policies (opens new window). API Management also enables you to manage versions (opens new window) of your API. It also allows you to design the API methods (opens new window) and documentation that you expose, so that it works for your users, regardless of what the original API looks like. And you can run API Management in several usage tiers (opens new window), including a consumption tier, which is billed per execution."
