    "Description": "Hi all,\nWith excitement we're sharing today that Vue.js is Wikimedia\nFoundation's official choice for adoption as future JavaScript\nframework for use with MediaWiki.\n\nThe evaluation of front-end frameworks officially started mid 2019, as\npart of the Platform Evolution program’s goal to evolve our technology\nplatform and development processes to empower the Wikimedia\nMovement[0].\nThe corresponding Technical RFC was successfully resolved in March\n2020[1]. As this framework selection is a wide-ranging, long-term\ndecision, a dedicated group, the Front-end Architecture Working\nGroup[2], was established to drive the technology comparison and the\nfinal recommendation. Besides the resolved RFC the outcome was to\nbuild and test developer experience in a pilot project[3].\n\nThe selected pilot was within the Desktop Improvements project[4] with\nits new Vue.js-based TypeaheadSearch feature that allows for providing\nadditional context while searching. Since its introduction in March\n2021[5] the new TypeaheadSearch component has been the default across\n15 wikis of varying sizes and has received positive user feedback[6].\nA final developer satisfaction survey was completed to gain further\ninformation on the developer experience. The survey results emphasized\n“a positive light on the future of working with Vue.js”. And “[t]he\nengineers felt optimistic about the future and confident in\nrecommending it for adoption across all our teams.”\n\nThe pilot gave us confidence in the recommendation to adopt Vue.js and\nwe are moving into further implementation of Vue.js tooling and\nproduct migration planning.\n\nTo support further efforts, the Wikimedia Foundation has established\nthe Wikimedia Design System team[7], which I'm proudly part of. Our\ncontinued work and upcoming priorities include:\n- Preparing a shared Vue.js user-interface components library\n- Deciding on Vue 2 or Vue 3 including transition path\n- Figuring out how the components library will be built and\ndistributed in and beyond MediaWiki\nYou can find more of the ongoing work on Phabricator[8].\n\nFor full transparency, we've carried that knowledge with us for some\ntime already, but were prioritizing progressing integration, annual\nplanning and our internal All-hands conference to finally arrive at\nthis announcement today.\n\nI'd like to thank a number of folks involved in leading to this, all\nFront-end Architecture Working Group members, especially colleagues\nEric Gardner & Roan Kattouw for driving the RFC, the Readers Web team\nfor undergoing as pilot implementers and especially our former\ncolleague Stephen Niedzielski who was central to making it a success,\nWikimedia Deutschland for numerous insights through their Vue.js\nexperience, current Design System team members responsible for further\nprogress, all Movement volunteers involved in both providing feedback\nto the pilot and contributing to development and Product & Tech\ndepartment leadership for their strong support of this wide-reaching\nchange.\n\nBest regards,\nVolker\n\nReferences\n[0]\nhttps://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Platform_Evolution/Recommendations#1._Develo…\n[1] https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180\n[2] https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Frontend_Architecture_Working_Group\n[3] https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=File:FAWG_Demo.pdf&page=26\n[4] https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements\n[5]\nhttps://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements/Updates#Mar…\n[6]\nhttps://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements#List_of_ear…\n[7] https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Design_Systems_Team\n[8] https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T286946\n\n---\nVolker Eckl\nDesign Lead\nWikimedia Design System\n\nWikimedia Foundation\n1 Montgomery Street\nSuite 1600\nSan Francisco, CA 94104"
