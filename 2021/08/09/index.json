    "Description": "My in-box has been flooded over the last few days about Apple's CSAM announcement. Everyone seems to want my opinion since I've been deep into photo analysis technologies and the reporting of child exploitation materials. In this blog entry, I'm going to go over what Apple announced, existing technologies, and the impact to end users. Moreover, I'm going to call out some of Apple's questionable claims."
