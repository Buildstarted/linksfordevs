    "Description": "I'll choose some of my favourite ones, The Endbringers from the web serial Worm. These are a group of semi-kaiju, but I think they count. They fullfill a similar role in any case. Every few months one of them attacks a target. The target is typically a city, though other targets have been shown, but they always want to cause damage and instability to society. For example, Behemoth, the first one, attacked and destroyed a large oil field in Iran, and another attacked and destroyed a plane containing the prince of China, causing a war. All of these should be able to easily beat most versions of Godzilla, though I don’t know about the high-end versions included in the composite. General Capabilities: Each Endbringer has absolutely insane durability. They consist of about 200 layers, each twice as tough as the last, with a core at the middle. They only die if you manage to destroy the core. The outer layer is quite vulnerable, but their durability quickly starts getting insane just a few layers in. By the time you reach the middle, you pretty much have to break the laws of physics to break through. A guy had a halberd that breaks molecular bonds, effectively disintigrating any matter it touches with no resistance. It got halfway through one Endbringer’s hand before getting stuck. The limbs are far more fragile than the torso, only consisting of 33 layers. The characters once dropped a bomb that would have destroyed India on Behemoth, concentrated on him using forcefields. The damage was entirely superficial. Nukes hardly even scratch them. They also have insane regeneration, only getting quicker the further towards to core you get. Most of them could easily destroy humanity through various ways. The only reason everyone in the books isn’t dead is because the Endbringers don’t want them dead, and run away if they take enough superficial damage during fights, which only superhumans can do. It takes hundreds of them, and many die in the fights. If the Endbringers stopped jobbing, they could kill almost every single one of the people fighting them. Now, for the specific Endbringers Behemoth45 feet tall, Behemoth is the second largest and most durable of the Endbringers. He’s a dynakinetic, so he controls energy. Radiation, kinetic energy, you name it. He shoots lightning that he controls completely, powerful enough to incinerate buildings, and if anyone gets within 32 feet of him they are instantly incinerated from the inside and out. He can emit a shockwave that levels buildings and extends for over half a mile, or a scream that turns people into figurative jelly. He can also redirect kinetic energy, whether it be into the ground or back at the one who inflicted the damage. He can also use this to run pretty quickly. While not attacking, he constantly burrows through the Earths mantle. It’s stated that he could manipulate energy underground to cause richter 10 earthquakes across the planet, but he doesn’t. Behemoth could probably just pull the radiation right out of Godzilla and turn it into enough energy to incinerate him from the inside. LeviathanLeviathan is the one that most resembles classic kaiju, though smaller. 30 feet tall, he’s a hydrokinetic powerful enough that he in a previous attack sunk Newfoundland. Yes, that Newfoundland. Kyushu as well. It took him a few hours, probably a lot less if he had actually been trying. At least supersonic underwater (He’s stated as moving so fast it looks like he’s teleporting), he’s extremely fast on land and when he moves creates water where he’s been. He can also create large amounts of water at will. He floods entire cities in minutes. Fast enough to run on water even though he weighs nine tons, though that might be an effect of his hydrokinesis. Additionally extremely agile. He at one point overpowered and held down a hero who held up over a million tons of steel by herself. Easily capable of breaking steel with physical strength. Also very intelligent, capable of exploiting weaknesses and using basic strategy, such as feigning injury to launch a surprise attack. After an upgrade he gained fins that severed molecular bonds, ignoring conventional durability. I’m pretty sure he could cut Godzilla to pieces after pinning him under a literal oceans worth of water. Could also use the water in Godzilla (if there is any) to rip him apart. SimurghSecond smallest of the Endbringers, at around 15 feet, the Simurgh is also the least conventionally dangerous, though by far the most dangerous in the long term. She’s an extremely powerful telekinetic, easily capable of lifting large buildings and flinging them several miles away and ripping people to shreds, though she typically doesn’t do the last one. She’s also the only telepath in the setting, as she uses her telekinesis to affect the brains of people around her. This includes people hearing constant screaming, hallucinations, or just reprogramming them to do her bidding. When she first appeared she reprogrammed an entire city into terrorists. Many people who fight her go insane. She also has near perfect precognition, seeing 80 years into the future and the past. It makes her literally perfect at manipulating events around her. During one attack she built a portal to another dimension and a few people came through. They tried to survive in this new, strange world, but two years later one of them turned into a giant monster and exposed a worldwide conspiracy. Just as planned. Another brilliant scientist turned into one of the world’s worst supervillains after an attack from Simurgh killed his family. If you’re fighting her, she’s been preparing for years. She knows everything you’re going to do before you were even born. She also coordinates the other Endbringers to deal the most damage in a single attack. It’s largely because of her that things are going to shit in the book. Also capable of space travel at at least orbital speed. Can assimilate technology and build enhanced versions of that tech using things around her. While fighting. If she’s fighting Godzilla, she has something prepared. Or she could just rip apart any vulnerable parts on him, including brains and internal organs, without breaching the skin. KhonsuKhonsu is one of the most dangerous Endbringers, as he doesn’t pick one target. He just keeps picking targets until he’s beaten. His main thing is teleporting on a global scale. Around 35 feet tall. Also the most durable of the Endbringers due to having powerful forcefields between all of his layers. Main offense is three city block-sized pillars of accelerated time that randomly appear, move, and disappear around him. He controls what gets in and out of the pillars, and if he doesn’t want it, it’s literally impossible to get in or out. People who get stuck in there starve to death in seconds. He hit a nuclear weapon stockpile in Russia, trapping them in the pillars, waiting for the casings to erode, and then lifting the effect the second they detonated. He can also use the pillars on himself to speed up his regeneration. If Godzilla gets trpped in one of the pillars, he stays there for as long as Khonsu wants him to stay there. If he doesn’t fit in them it would get very unpleasant, as Godzilla would likely, again, be ripped apart. The Twins, Tohu and Bohu Smallest and largest of the Endbringers respectively, Tohu is around 10 feet tall while Bohu ranges in size from 10 feet to 5 miles after absorbing material from the ground, though she’s still as durable even in small form. Bohu appears from the ground in the middle of her target city. She’s a small-scale reality warper, turning the entire city against the defenders, creating traps from the buildings and the streets. It’s unclear as to whether or not she can affect living things. She can also cover the streets in giant spikes. While she might not be able to kill Godzilla, she can definitely help Tohu against him. Tohu is the dangerous one of the two. While Bohu destroys the city, Tohu defends her. Tohu has three heads, and each head is that of a superhuman, granting her the powers of that super. She can do this with any super featured in the book. For example, she uses the head of one who is literally invincible, and one who shoots lasers. Used creatively, Godzilla doesn’t have a ghost of a chance against her. There are literally hundreds of ways she could do it, including trapping his head in a small time loop. All in all, any of the endbringers have this in the bag. While not all of them have the firepower to hurt Godzilla, Godzilla in turn has not a chance in hell of permanently hurting them. The only way any of them were killed was by a guy who blatantly ignores the laws of physics (Yes, I know Godzilla does this too, but that’s not the point). Edit: It has come to my attention that composite Godzilla is fucking insane, so several of these wouldn’t be able to beat him. Khonsu or Tohu with some OP combo of powers should still be able to do it though."
