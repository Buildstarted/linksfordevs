    "Description": "In my last post I made the case that programmers should try and write their software in a way that makes reasonable use of the resources of the computer. By reasonable use, I didnâ€™t mean to try and perform every crazy micro-optimization possible to extract every last speck of performance from the machine: instead, I meant to have mechanical sympathy and to write software in a way that works with the hardware rather than against it."
