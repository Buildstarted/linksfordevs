    "Description": "Intro From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a full-time engineer and as a part-time recruiter. I made $500k by placing 28 engineers at companies like Snap, Palantir and Betterment. My average fee was ~$30k with a range of $23k-$40k. My split on commission ranged from 30-100%. My recruiting take home was $500,745."

    "Description": "There are many circumstances in which uncertainty is warranted.1 Gas temperature measurements, weather forecasts, horse races, coin flips, and clinical trials all have some uncertainty involved. Probability theory is the science that finds commonality among these seemingly disconnected phenomena. We can observe, for example, that the summation of many “repeatable” random events, properly normalized, begins to look like a gaussian distribution (aka the central limit theorem). We can notice common shapes in the histograms of these repeatable experiments, such as “fat-tailed” or “power law” distributions. And if the event is not repeatable, we can at least apply the rules of probability theory to avoid inconsistencies in our thinking (which would allow a savvy adversary to take advantage of us when gambling). Many events are unpredictable to us in practice, either because the laws governing the outcome are not known, or because the laws are known but the observations required are too arduous to make. Sometimes the required observations are too numerous to collect (as in statistical mechanics), and other times the non-linear, chaotic nature of the system necessitates observations that are too precise to be practical. Quantum experiments seem to be inherently unpredictable, although whether this is a fundamental facet of nature is a matter of debate. ↩"

The key idea is that you journal every day, and must write (at least) 750 words, or around 3 pages. I’d been journaling on and off in a paper journal for a year at that point, generally maxing out at one or two entries a month. Trying to bring a little more rigour to my approach was appealing, so I figured I’d give it a go for a week and see what happens. Two and a half years later, I’m still going strong. 1000 days in, here are my thoughts on what it’s done for me, what I (vaguely) expected to get out of it, and what I’ve learned:"
