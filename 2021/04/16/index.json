    "Domain": "www.brandons.me",
    "Description": "Lately I've been seeing lots of anecdotes from people trying to get into Rust\nwho get really hung up on strings (&str, String, and their relationship).\nBeyond Rust's usual challenges around ownership, there can be an added layer of\nfrustration because strings are so easy in the great majority of languages.\nYou just add them together, split them, whatever! They're primitives that you\ncan do whatever you want with. For someone who's only ever known this mental\nmodel (which is to say, never worked much with C/C++), using strings in Rust\ncan be a rude awakening. They feel very complicated, have all these\nrestrictions and extra steps, and it all just seems so unnecessary."
