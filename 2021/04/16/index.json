They're primitives that you\ncan do whatever you want with. For someone who's only ever known this mental\nmodel (which is to say, never worked much with C/C++), using strings in Rust\ncan be a rude awakening. They feel very complicated, have all these\nrestrictions and extra steps, and it all just seems so unnecessary."
