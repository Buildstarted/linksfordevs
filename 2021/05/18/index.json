Almost instantly after the announcement, concerns emerged that AirTags could be also be used to track people, too. Apple did, to its credit, add some anti-stalking and anti-tracking mechanisms to the AirTags. An AirTag that is travelling with someone who is not its owner is meant to alert its target thereof, either through a notification (for those who have Apple devices with iOS 14.5 or higher) or through an audible noise that they make after three days. Only a few days after the AirTag’s release, many security experts described their mechanisms as ineffective: an AirTag slipped into somebody’s coat pocket or backpack could easily have revealed their home address by the time the notification shows up or an alert rings."
