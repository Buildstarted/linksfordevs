    "Description": "We see plenty of configuration languages, but surprisingly one has not become the one true language that is used everywhere. Why is that? One would think writing out data structures by hand would not be that hard. Why not configure everything in JSON and call it a day?

Not for a lack of effort, the industry has failed to standardize on a solution that we are satisfied with and move on."
