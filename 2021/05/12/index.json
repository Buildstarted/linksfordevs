In one of the project I am working there is a requirement to extract thumbnail for the video uploaded by user to a Azure Storage Account. This is implemented using .NET and C#. For extracting the video thumbnail - FFMediaToolkit package is used. And I am using ImageSharp package is for saving the image as well. I am using Azure Portal to create the function. You can use the same code if you’re using Visual Studio or VS Code, for the simplicity I am using CSX function. The function is using Windows OS. Platform is 64 Bit. Once you created the function app, create a new function with Blob Trigger."
