Jeremy is an internationally selling author, keynote speaker, and professional coder with a personal mission to empower developers to be their best! He has worked on commercial enterprise software for 25 years and specializes in web technology. Currently, he is also a Sr. Cloud Developer Advocate for Microsoft, but previously held roles at iVision, Wintellect, and AirWatch. &nbsp; Last year when Jeremy was on the podcast last, they discussed DevOps automation. In this episode, they focus the discussion on working with data on .NET. Jeremy shares about the work that he had been doing on the .NET Data team for the last year, Entity Framework Core, Microsoft Dataverse, GraphQL, and more! &nbsp; Topics of Discussion: [:38] Be sure to visit  for past episodes and show notes. [:51] About The Azure DevOps Podcast, Clear Measure, the new podcast Architect Tips, and Jeffrey’s offer to speak at virtual user groups. [1:28] About today’s episode with Jeremy Likness. [1:53] Jeffrey welcomes Jeremy back to the podcast! [2:15] Jeremy gives an overview of his role as the Senior Program Manager working on .NET Data and the work that his team does. [5:37] About Microsoft Dataverse and Jeremy and his team have been working with the Azure Storage and Dataverse teams. [8:28] Of the different methods of working with data in C#, what’s the general distribution? Which methods have greater adoption? [11:17] Jeremy and Jeffrey discuss different .NET project types and whether Entity Framework 5.0 the latest stable release. [11:55] Jeremy shares what is most exciting to him with this upcoming .NET release. [13:25] What’s the go-to store on the client-side?

    "Description": "Airborne transmission by droplets and aerosols is important for the spread of viruses. Face masks are a well-established preventive measure, but their effectiveness for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still under debate. We show that variations in mask efficacy can be explained by different regimes of virus abundance and related to population-average infection probability and reproduction number. For SARS-CoV-2, the viral load of infectious individuals can vary by orders of magnitude. We find that most environments and contacts are under conditions of low virus abundance (virus-limited) where surgical masks are effective at preventing virus spread. More advanced masks and other protective equipment are required in potentially virus-rich indoor environments including medical centers and hospitals. Masks are particularly effective in combination with other preventive measures like ventilation and distancing."
