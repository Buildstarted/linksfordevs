The\nname \"LLVM\" was once an acronym, but is now just a brand for the\numbrella project.  While LLVM provides some unique capabilities, and\nis known for some of its great tools (e.g., the Clang\ncompiler2, a C/C++/Objective-C\ncompiler which provides a number of benefits over the GCC compiler),\nthe main thing that sets LLVM apart from other compilers is its\ninternal architecture."
