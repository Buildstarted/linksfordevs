I went blank into this conversation, with little knowledge about GraphQL, and I am delighted about it and will certainly try out an implementation of it (as GraphQL is not a technology, but a specification). So if you want to create easy to use APIs that are fast, listen to the episode to learn how to create those with GraphQL. "
