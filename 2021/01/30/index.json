    "Description": "Cryptographic protocols have been widely used to protect the user's privacy\nand avoid exposing private information. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections),\nas an alternative to traditional HTTP, demonstrates its unique transmission\ncharacteristics: based on UDP for encrypted resource transmission, accelerating\nweb page rendering. However, existing encrypted transmission schemes based on\nTCP are vulnerable to website fingerprinting (WFP) attacks, allowing\nadversaries to infer the users' visited websites by eavesdropping on the\ntransmission channel. Whether QUIC protocol can effectively resisting to such\nattacks is worth investigating. In this work, we demonstrated the extreme\nvulnerability of QUIC under WFP attacks by comparing attack results under\nwell-designed conditions. We also study the transferability of features, which\nenable the adversary to use proven effective features on a special protocol\nattacking a new protocol. This study shows that QUIC is more vulnerable to WFP\nattacks than HTTPS in the early traffic scenario but is similar in the normal\nscenario. The maximum attack accuracy on QUIC is 56.8 % and 73 % higher than on\nHTTPS utilizing Simple features and Transfer features. The insecurity\ncharacteristic of QUIC explains the dramatic gap. We also find that features\nare transferable between protocols, and the feature importance is partially\ninherited on normal traffic due to the relatively fixed browser rendering\nsequence and the similar request-response model of protocols. However, the\ntransferability is inefficient when on early traffic, as QUIC and HTTPS show\nsignificantly different vulnerability when considering early traffic. We also\nshow that attack accuracy on QUIC could reach 95.4 % with only 40 packets and\njust using simple features, whereas only 60.7 % when on HTTPS."
