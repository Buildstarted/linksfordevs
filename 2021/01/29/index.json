These were obviously minor issues, things hard to reproduce or very rare problems. In other words, it was quite reasonably stable, which normally goes without saying when it comes to Factorio stable versions. But it proved to be a mistake wording it this way, since some media picked up on it and presented it as a \"fairly bugged release\". \n \n \n \nSo I'm pretty thrilled to finally get to the point, where we actually have 0 known issues and 0 active bug reports on the forums.
