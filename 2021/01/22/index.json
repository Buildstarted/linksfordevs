    "Description": "Everyone has read a novel and used software, but how many people really know how they're produced? It may surprise many (also within the two disciplines) to learn that the process of writing a book and that of writing software have quite a lot of similarities. The similarities are so profound, in fact, that tools and techniques used within one practice can be adapted and applied to the other to improve the process."

This model ensures McDonald’s a steady revenue stream independent of changing seasons or sensibilities, while also helping them cut operating costs. It’s a great business model."

For those (probably few) who don’t know what Electron is, it’s a cross-platform desktop app framework built on top of Chromium and NodeJS (which in turn is based on Chrome’s V8 engine). This Chrome-ception allows developers to build complete desktop applications using web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JS, and the ~500 MB of node_modules we all know and love."
