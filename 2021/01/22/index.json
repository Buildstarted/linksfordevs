    "Description": "The world’s biggest fast food chains don’t make money selling food – they make money selling subscriptions. 93% of McDonald’s restaurants are franchises, where the restaurant is owned by McDonald’s and rented out to a franchisee who operates it. This model ensures McDonald’s a steady revenue stream independent of changing seasons or sensibilities, while also helping them cut operating costs. It’s a great business model."

    "Description": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 5 years, chances are you have used an Electron-based application at least once in your life. For those (probably few) who don’t know what Electron is, it’s a cross-platform desktop app framework built on top of Chromium and NodeJS (which in turn is based on Chrome’s V8 engine). This Chrome-ception allows developers to build complete desktop applications using web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JS, and the ~500 MB of node_modules we all know and love."
