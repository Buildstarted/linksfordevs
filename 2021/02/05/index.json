    "Description": "Back in December, I asked how hard it would be to make a vaccine for oneself.\nSeveral people pointed to radvac. It was a best-case scenario: an open-source\nvaccine design, made for self-experimenters, dead simple to make with\nreadily-available materials, well-explained reasoning about the design, and with\nthe name of one of the world’s more competent biologists (who I already knew of\nbeforehand) stamped on the whitepaper. My girlfriend and I made a batch a week\nago and took our first booster yesterday.\n\nThis post talks a bit about the process, a bit about our plan, and a bit about\nmotivations. Bear in mind that we may have made mistakes - if something seems\noff, leave a comment.\n\nTHE PROCESS\nAll of the materials and equipment to make the vaccine cost us about $1000. We\ndid not need any special licenses or anything like that. I do have a little\nwetlab experience from my undergrad days, but the skills required were pretty\nminimal.\n\nOne vial of custom peptide - that little pile of white powder at the bottom.The\nlarge majority of the cost (about $850) was the peptides. These are the main\nactive ingredients of the vaccine: short segments of proteins from the COVID\nvirus. They’re all <25 amino acids, so far too small to have any likely function\nas proteins (for comparison, COVID’s spike protein has 1273 amino acids).\nThey’re just meant to be recognized by the immune system: the immune system\nlearns to recognize these sequences, and that’s what provides immunity.\n\nEach of six peptides came in two vials of 4.5 mg each. These are the half we\nhaven't dissolved; we keep them in the freezer as backups.The peptides were\ncustom synthesized. There are companies which synthesize any (short) peptide\nsequence you want - you can find dozens of them online. The cheapest options\nsuffice for the vaccine - the peptides don’t need to be “purified” (this just\nmeans removing partial sequences), they don’t need any special modifications,\nand very small amounts suffice. The minimum order size "

    "Description": "A new and extensively revised edition of a popular textbook used in universities, coding boot camps, hacker clubs, and online courses.\n                The best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads learners through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build the hardware platform and software hierarchy for a simple but powerful computer system. In the process, learners gain hands-on knowledge of hardware, architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures and algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book introduces learners to a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other computer science courses fit into the overall picture. The outcome of these efforts is known as Nand to Tetris: a journey that starts with the most elementary logic gate, called Nand, and ends, twelve projects later, with a general-purpose computer system capable of running Tetris.\n                    The first edition of this popular textbook inspired Nand to Tetris classes in universities, coding boot camps, hacker clubs, and online course platforms. This second edition has been extensively revised. It has been restructured into two distinct parts—part I, Hardware, and part II, Software—with six projects in each part. All chapters and projects have been rewritten, with an emphasis on separating abstraction from implementation, and many new sections, figures, and examples have been added. Substantial new appendixes offer focused presentation on technical and theoretical topics."

    "Description": "Classic papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Norbert Wiener and Gordon Moore that chart the evolution of computer science.\n                \n                    Ideas That Created the Future collects forty-six classic papers in computer science that map the evolution of the field. It covers all aspects of computer science: theory and practice, architectures and algorithms, and logic and software systems, with an emphasis on the period of 1936–1980 but also including important earlier work. Offering papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Alan Turing and Nobert Wiener, the book documents the discoveries and inventions that created today's digital world. A brief essay by volume editor Harry Lewis, offering historical and intellectual context, accompanies each paper.Readers will learn that we owe to Aristotle the realization that fixed rules of logic can apply to different phenomena—that logic provides a general framework for reasoning—and that Leibniz recognized the merits of binary notation. They can read Ada Lovelace's notes on L. F. Menabrea's sketch of an analytical engine, George Boole's attempt to capture the rules of reason in mathematical form, David Hilbert's famous 1900 address, “Mathematical Problems,” and Alan Turing's illumination of a metamathematical world. Later papers document the “Cambrian era” of 1950s computer design, Maurice Wilkes's invention of microcode, Grace Hopper's vision of a computer's “education,” Ivan Sutherland's invention of computer graphics at MIT, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman's pioneering work on encryption, and much more. Lewis's guided tour of a burgeoning field is especially welcome at a time when computer education is increasingly specialized."
