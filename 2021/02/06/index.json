In this article I will explain how to manage Azure App Service SSL certificates with Azure Key Vault Service. If you’re running SAAS applications on Azure App Service with custom domains and SSL certificates it is quite complicated. Here is a screenshot of an App Service running a SAAS app with custom domain and SSL certificates."

    "Description": "Industry trends: serial memory attachment. One of the most interesting\nthings which will happen in the near future in computing is the adoption of\nserial memory interfaces. For pretty much the entire history of modern\ncomputing, RAM has been attached to a system via a high-speed parallel\ninterface. Making parallel interfaces fast is hard and requires extremely\nrigorous control of timing skew between pins, therefore the routing of PCB\ntraces between a CPU and RAM slots must be done with great precision. At the\nspeeds of modern parallel RAM interfaces like DDR4, what is theoretically a\ndigital interface in practice must be viewed as practically analog (to the\npoint that part of a CPU DDR4 controller is called the “PHY”). Moreover, the\nmaximum distance between a CPU and its RAM slots is extremely tight. The\npositioning of RAM slots on a motherboard is largely constrained by these\nphysics considerations. For these reasons you have never seen anything like the\nflexibility with RAM attachment that you can get with, for example, PCIe or\nSAS. PCIe and SAS are serial architectures which support cabling and even\nswitching, allowing entire additional chassis of PCIe and SAS devices to be\nattached to a system via cables."

Which was great, and worked well for me.\nBut while the books in this list have been useful for me as an engineering leader, anybody at any level can get a lot out of them."
