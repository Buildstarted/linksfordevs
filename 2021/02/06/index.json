    "Description": "Industry trends: serial memory attachment. One of the most interesting\nthings which will happen in the near future in computing is the adoption of\nserial memory interfaces. For pretty much the entire history of modern\ncomputing, RAM has been attached to a system via a high-speed parallel\ninterface. Making parallel interfaces fast is hard and requires extremely\nrigorous control of timing skew between pins, therefore the routing of PCB\ntraces between a CPU and RAM slots must be done with great precision. At the\nspeeds of modern parallel RAM interfaces like DDR4, what is theoretically a\ndigital interface in practice must be viewed as practically analog (to the\npoint that part of a CPU DDR4 controller is called the “PHY”). Moreover, the\nmaximum distance between a CPU and its RAM slots is extremely tight. The\npositioning of RAM slots on a motherboard is largely constrained by these\nphysics considerations. For these reasons you have never seen anything like the\nflexibility with RAM attachment that you can get with, for example, PCIe or\nSAS. PCIe and SAS are serial architectures which support cabling and even\nswitching, allowing entire additional chassis of PCIe and SAS devices to be\nattached to a system via cables."

When\nattempting to perform some action, the system would provide feedback\nthat everything was going as planned, and then \"go dark,\" seemingly\nout of no where. It's important to realize that this is a complex\ndistributed system, and that there is a network connection between the\n\"part that worked\" and \"the part that went dark.\" But, there wasn't a\nchange to the connection logic, and it worked before, so that\n\"couldn't possibly be it.\" (Yes. I already told you where this is going—Ed)"

When starting out, my reading was mostly about the specifics of using Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. Which was great, and worked well for me.\nBut while the books in this list have been useful for me as an engineering leader, anybody at any level can get a lot out of them."
