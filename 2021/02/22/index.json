    "Description": "One of the most important tasks of the distribution packager is to ensure that the software shipped to our users is free of security vulnerabilities.  While finding and fixing the vulnerable code is usually considered upstream’s responsibility, the packager needs to ensure that all these fixes reach the end users ASAP.  With the aid of central package management and dynamic linking, the Linux distributions have pretty much perfected the deployment of security fixes.  Ideally, fixing a vulnerable dependency is as simple as patching a single shared library via the distribution’s automated update system."
