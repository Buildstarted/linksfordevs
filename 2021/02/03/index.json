    "Description": "Drapetomania was a conjectural mental illness that, in 1851, American physician Samuel A. Cartwright hypothesized as the cause of enslaved Africans fleeing captivity.[1]:41 Contemporarily reprinted in the South, Cartwright's article was widely mocked and satirized in the northern United States. The concept has since been debunked as pseudoscience[2]:2 and shown to be part of the edifice of scientific racism.[3]"

Winters in New England can be pretty dry,\nso we have a $40 humidifier 1 at home that, well, humidifies the room. Naturally, I want a HomeKit-enabled\nhumidifier. However, Apple’s website lists only one model currently on sale, and that model has a very\nsmall water tank which won’t last even a day. Meanwhile, I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W lying around, so it seems\na good idea to put the Raspberry Pi into the humidifier to add HomeKit support. After all, everyone wants\na humidifier with an 1 GHz ARM processor inside, isn’t it?"
