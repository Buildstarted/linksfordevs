    "Domain": "corewcf.github.io",
    "Description": "After 21 months of public development, CoreWCF has finally reached its first GA release. It‚Äôs been a long path to get here, and thee is still have a long way to go. CoreWCF started off as a prototype internal to Microsoft which was started after a meeting with Scott Hunter. During that meeting Scott said something which has shaped the entire development of CoreWCF. He said that we only want one service host (the concept, not the WCF ServiceHost class) in .NET Core. ASP.NET Core had already been released, which meant there wasn‚Äôt a place for ServiceHost (the WCF class). This made a lot of sense, so I set about building a WCF prototype on top of ASP.NET Core. Eventually a decision was made to release the prototype as a community project under the name CoreWCF. The prototype focused on the developer experience so a lot of the implementation needed some love and attention, and 21 months later, we‚Äôre releasing our first GA release. Along the way, the CoreWCF project caught the attention of the Amazon AWS team and they have been contributing significantly to help make this project a success. It is thanks to the contributions from Amazon AWS that the initial release supports WS-* protocols (WS-Security, WS-SecureConversation), and some token authentication credential types with the TransportWithMessageCredentials security mode. This is a significant step towards supporting WS-Federation to enable moving enterprise WCF services to CoreWCF hosted on a cloud platform."
