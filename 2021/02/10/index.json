Different\npeople have reservations or concerns around different aspects of the\nsemantics and the syntax (as does the Steering Council). In spite of this,\nafter much deliberation, reviewing all conversations around these PEPs, as\nwell as competing proposals and existing poll results, and after several\nin-person discussions with the PEP authors, we are confident that Pattern\nMatching as specified in PEP 634, et al, will be a great addition to the\nPython language.\""
