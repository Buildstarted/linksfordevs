Just in case you are not familiar, free software as in freedom and not free beer. Free software back then was this super radical and idealistic concept where as you make a software product commercial or not, but when you distribute it you include the source code of it. The person who got your product would eventually continue to develop it and it will evolve and continually improve as it gets to many users. You then will be looking at their version of your product and will see how it has grown further. Think of it has a community garden where everyone grows their vegetable and anyone would then take pointers on some of your crops and grow their improved version. Eventually you’ll see where you are doing it wrong by looking at how they tend their garden. This is not necessarily free food for everyone – although it’s common. It’s freedom to copy and use my garden setup so we have bigger crops next harvest time."

    "Description": "I recently took a sales pitch from Prodoscore at the behest of a colleague, and now I'm very concerned about\n            the future of work. Much in the way that a poor (or even average) credit score can damage and ruin your\n            chances\n            at some opportunities, so too will a productivity score define your relative worth as an employee by\n            reducing\n            every aspect of your daily work life into a single number - your \"Prodoscore\". The sales pitch of course was\n            presented in a light of \"helping employers identify 'less productive' employees, and give transparency to\n            team\n            leaders on performance\". At least at first."
