    "Description": "I just finished the writing part of the new edition of the Developer Advocacy Handbook. I wrote the original almost 15 years ago, and this edition is a heavy re-write. A lot has changed in the world of Developer Advocacy and I tried to add my findings over the last few years to the book. It gives you all the basics of becoming a Developer Advocate and explains which channels to cover and how. I deliberately moved away from favouring certain products or social networks as these things change at a fast pace."
