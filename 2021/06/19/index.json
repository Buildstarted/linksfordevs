    "Description": "For more than a decade, PulseAudio\nhas been serving the Linux desktop as its predominant audio\nmixing and routing daemon ‚Äî and its audio API. Unfortunately,\nPulseAudio's internal architecture does not fit the growing\nsandboxed-applications use case, even though there have been attempts to amend that. PipeWire, a new daemon created (in part)\nout of these attempts, will replace\nPulseAudio in the upcoming Fedora 34 release. It is a coming\ntransition that deserves a look."
