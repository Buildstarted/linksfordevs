While developers do not widely use pattern matching today, we’ll likely see its adoption grow as more teams and applications move from the Full Framework (.NET 4.8) to the runtime’s newer variants (.NET 5+). Like most unique features to the language, there’s always an initial knee-jerk reaction to either embrace it, use it everywhere, or outright hate it. Regardless of what camp we fall under, we must understand some everyday use cases in the chance we want to work with C# pattern matching."
