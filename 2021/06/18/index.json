    "Description": "Well, I’m leaving Microsoft after nearly 6 years. I’ll take a short bit of time off before my next job. I’m going to be joining the fine folks at Honeycomb to help contribute towards building an even better developer experience (and perhaps a bunch of other stuff too).\n Yes, I made this picture in powerpoint.   Since I’ve been heavily involved in the F# and .NET community for several years, I wanted to write a little bit about why, and about my deep commitment and belief in the open source technologies and communities I am involved in, even as my workplace role changes."

    "Description": "Triplebyte is pivoting, and we no longer require a quiz or interview to join. Engineers are almost completely unique as a labor force.

We want to stop being a placement agency, and instead become a job search platform that leverages that unique power to create a better hiring process for engineers."
