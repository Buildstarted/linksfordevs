Minimal APIs will help new developers to build their first ASP.NET Core apps with less ceremony. This will also helps developers to build small microservices and HTTP APIs. This feature is released as part of .NET Core 6.0 Preview 4 - which released along with Microsoft Build 2021 few days back. To get started, you need to create an ASP.NET Core empty web app, you can do this with the command dotnet new web. Once you created the project you will get a directory structure like this."
