    "Description": "Microservice applications are composed of small, independently versioned, and scalable customer-focused services that communicate with each other over standard protocols with well-defined interfaces. Each microservice typically encapsulates simple business logic, which you can scale out or in, test, deploy, and manage independently.  Smaller teams develop a microservice based on a customer scenario and use any technologies that they want to use. This module will teach you how to build your first microservice with .NET."
