I consider this to be one of the most interesting ways to evaluate the quality of a generative algorithm, and certainly one that is unique to the medium. Striking the right balance of unpredictability and quality is a difficult challenge for even the best artists in this field. This is why I’m so excited that Fidenza is being showcased on Art Blocks, the only site in existence that perfectly suits generative art and raises the bar for developing these kinds of high-quality generative art algorithms."

    "Description": "Last year, my 45th, having just left Facebook and then taking a break, I wound up running a number of interviews and doing really horribly, until I found the right discipline for the eclectic set of skills I’ve developed over these years. The cutoff varies, depending on your time in the industry. Since I skipped college and went straight into the business, it really started around 40 for me. The work is there, the opportunities are there, but the interviews and expectations on you change. People are going to want more expertise and knowledge out of you than key-pressing. They’re going to expect an architect, an engineer, a solutions designer, an instructor, a risk analyzer, a mentor.. “I like to get my hands dirty” stops implying team player and starts suggesting “micro-manager” or under-development of your engineering skills (this candidate won’t build our new micro-service architecture, instead manually write html files at 10 words per minute while telling us all about the new hotness in apache from 6 years ago). The angle of many of your interviews is going to change. Your adaptability, enthusiasm for learning, those are obstacles as you shift from talking to junior managers to hiring managers and executives and CTOs. You’re also going to be increasingly likely to be interviewed as a team-match by people who are (perhaps not aware they’re going to be) junior to you. I had several Google all-day Google interviews last year which were some of the best/worst I’ve ever experienced. Acing thru the big-picture interviews, I struggled bitterly in the key-word-matching-disguised-as-coding-interview tests: The interviewer presents a fairly trivial problem with no context. ([edit] And when they say ‘imagine you’re working with a co-worker’ in these: Would you tolerate that from a co-worker? What am I, stack overflow incarnate?) Or they present a fairly specific yet abstract problem and propose a skeleton approach: “Oh, I wouldn’t take this approach because REALLY GOOD REASONS”. The interviewer feels the top of their head: was that static or a really low flying aircraft? “We could come back to that, but lets start with this”. Great: I wrote a multi-tasking operating system in assembler at the age of 14 and you want me to slog thru this 101 problem and say “linked list” at the right moment so you can ask me “when would a linked list be bad”, I can try not to quip “when it has you using it” and then you can say “what if we had billions of entries”. In these interviews I try to remember the consultants I've had to work with. Knew all the high-level jargon but couldn't tell you how a pointer works. That doesn't make it any less uncomfortable knowing we're going to waste 45 minutes obtaining phone-screen level stuff by someone who engages you as though Linked Lists are special magic. As an interviewee, this is incredibly difficult because I'm applying for a senior role, and now 45 minutes of my window is spent discussing linked lists 101. What makes this grate so badly is that sense of being on a rail. I asked one interviewer: Would you have used a linked list to solve the first problem? Oh no, it obviously wouldn't scale. Do you know I'm interviewing for a senior position? I'm filling in for another interviewer, I'm not exactly sure what position we're interviewing you for, I wouldn't have expected a senior to struggle so much with the initial linked-list problem. He wouldn't have used a linked list to solve his own linked-list problem... If this was a co-worker, I'd sit them down and walk them through applications and concerns with doubly vs single, circular, intrusive vs non-intrusive, figure out what facet of their requirement I’ve missed or they haven’t expressed, or what the gap in their knowledge is. In some of these 101 questions, I've actually been able to do this - come off the rail, so to speak - and that's actually been great. But, again: It all comes back down to the fear that you're losing 45 minutes of your window to someone's script. Again: it’s the rail. It’s like being asked to do finger painting while you wait for a real interviewer. I would certainly have reservations about hiring someone who did well in one of those interviews. Seriously? You chose an algorithmX to solve that problem? And you had to have a back-and-forth with the interviewer to finally decide to use an algorithmY to solve it for stage 2 and algorithmZ to solve it for stage 3? Yeesh. A bigger challenge, the bigger the company, is the interviewers recognizing that you're being interviewed because you stand out in some field; that you might be a peer. During my last round with Google, I didn’t do so well. One engineer asked me to write a very specific application, continually declined requests to clarify what part of the app he might want me to focus on, bemoaned my outlining the scope of what he’d just presented me, and then let me fall into a “well, this part is the most complex, so I’m going there” trap. Ultimately, he explicitly wanted to discuss a single function of a mundane part of the app. After the interview was officially over, he indicated that he had worked on the reference implementation of this part and had recently rewritten it with the “X Y Z algorithm” - wait: I mentioned that during the first 5 minutes of the interview! “No, you said X Z Y”. A second facet of this manifests in the sort of cloak-and-daggery aspect of people using storied examples. It can be challenging to get them to recognize \"I'm interviewing here precisely because I know about this kind of thing\". In two other cases, the engineers were put-off by my recognition of the problem and assumed I had “had this one before”. Seriously? You’ve read my resume, and you chose a question based on my experience, and then you are *surprised* that I say “oh this?” The first came in and sketched a distributed multi-process debugging problem, and I jokingly said “like, hunt the ooming java process?” He looked offended. But went ahead and gave me a 5 minute explanation of the system. I summarized “So it’s an ad-market with a web-based front end?” I spent a few seconds double-checking I had not just said something awful about his mother. I took a minute to make him aware we were on the same page because experience, and he responded really well to that. Asked me to walk him thru my thinking. But, tbh, I was frustrated at this point, so I gambled on instead showing him a totally different approach that I would build or work with producers/managers to get the engineers to build-in themselves. I wanted to get away from the “you read this on stack overflow” suspicion. Instead of treating this as a one-time issue, I identified it as a recurring issue, he argued but I pointed out: we’ve *both* done this multiple times. We know what the cause is, it’s the where and restoration-of-service that we care about. Ok, he bought that. At the end he confided that this was completely not what they were looking for in this particular question, but that he’d never had a candidate present the approach I had and that he’d actually be rethinking the question entirely. It was a difficult interview session, largely because the interviewer seemed so reluctant to consider that someone who hadn't worked at Google yet could have experienced a scenario like this. The second case … Presented me with a nice solid practical problem. A variation of something I’ve had to deal with in several scenarios, but he again seemed unaware of that. This bewilders me, because translating solutions into metaphors so that they can be reapplied is a basic aspect of engineering. In retrospect, he became increasingly annoyed as I moved towards a subtly different path than the one he seemed to be pushing for, with me - at the time - misreading the pushes as discussion bait. Ultimately I arrived close to his solution with a few improvements that he credited to his guidance. His final good humor fell away during the post-interview, when I pointed out that those improvements were specifically this point I’d made and that point I’d made, and that I’d been aiming towards this particular set of approaches from the offset (pointing to one of them still on the board). He specifically intimated that, because that wasn’t the system he’d implemented 10 years ago, we couldn’t know if it would have been better. [edit] I describe the above poorly, he'd specifically asked for feedback, and I was describing like he'd been trying to push me to a particular goal. Ultimately, this was a solved problem to both of us, but this interviewer just wasn’t ready to actually be challenged on it. His solution was elegant and simple; mine was similar with with a twist rather than an increment in complexity. It also involved an informed gamble that gave it more longevity than his. -Edit: This interviewer opened saying that he wanted us to treat this as an active problem we were trying to solve, working together with myself as lead to evaluate the level of seniority I was suited for. At each step he acknowledged the directions. The problem is either an unwillingness by an engineer to see someone else has already solved their problem (a common conceit among the big tech companies) or they didn’t believe my resume and were expecting a vastly less experienced engineer that they would prove to be a fraud through not knowing the word “linked list”. In either case, it’s agonizingly painful, [edit] and something worth finding a way to practice and prepare for. Attending conventions is a good way to find peers to challenge yourself with. I told one interviewer: How much do you know about modern CPU architecture? Because if what matters to you is whether I have a linked list implementation in L1 cache rather than RAM full of years of practical experience, knowledge of the various different implementations, plus intrusive vs non-intrusive caveats, cache coherence implications, etc, etc… We can stop here. I’ve discovered that in many of these scenarios, the interviewer is possibly overwhelmed or uncomfortable with your level of experience to the degree they struggle to find a common ground, and the interview is largely an attempt to try and figure out some way that they can disprove your claims or map your experience onto theirs. Have a couple of interesting problems up your sleeve. If you sit down and work on a meaningful project, you would do far better together than trying to randomly figure out an algorithm or data-structure you can sit around and discuss like a water-cooler conversation. The key to success, for me, came in finding companies that were capable of being interview*ed*. When I interviewed at Facebook in 2014, that was still very much the case, and Facebook’s interviews, although nail biting, were also utterly engaging. Google, LinkedIn, and some of the other big-tech companies, the entire process seems to presume you are a bug under a microscope. The slightest indication you might be looking back and you scare or anger them off. You can probably expect more churn, you’ll need more persistence and patience, but it’s not because the work is no-longer there."
