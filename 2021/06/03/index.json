    "Timestamp": "2021-06-03T06:10:12",
    "Domain": "microsoft.github.io",
    "Description": "Users prefer to interact with your application with natural language. For instance, they might want to ask your application something like \"What's the weather going to be like in New York?\". Your application needs to be able to understand natural input by identifying different parts of it, being flexible enough to not require exact phrases and by compensating for spelling errors and variations of words. This is a complex thing to do. In Azure, the Language Understanding service (opens new window) (which is part of the Cognitive Services (opens new window) family), can help you to understand natural user input. It uses AI and machine learning to understand language and extract information from it, that you can use in your application."
