From finding a book on Scribd, a movie on Netflix, toilet paper on Amazon, or anything else on the web through Google (like [how to do your job as a software engineer](https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/)), you've searched vast amounts of unstructured data multiple times today. What's even more amazing, is that you've even though you searched millions (or [billions](https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/)) of records, you got a response in milliseconds. In this post, we are going to build a basic full-text search engine that can search across millions of documents and rank them according to their relevance to the query in milliseconds, in less than 150 lines of code!"

    "Domain": "www.medrxiv.org",
    "Description": "Genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have become of great interest worldwide because they have the potential to detrimentally alter the course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and disease in individual patients. We recently sequenced 20,453 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients with COVID-19 disease in metropolitan Houston (population 7 million), dating from March 2020 to early February 2021. We discovered that all major variants of concern or interest are circulating in the region. To follow up on this discovery, we analyzed 8,857 genome sequences from patients in eight Houston Methodist hospitals dispersed throughout the metroplex diagnosed from January 1, 2021 to March 7, 2021. This sample represents 94% of Houston Methodist cases and 4.8% of all reported cases in metropolitan Houston during this period. We discovered rapid, widespread, and preferential increase of the SARS-CoV-2 UK B.1.1.7 throughout the region. The estimated case doubling time in the Houston area is 6.9 days. None of the 648 UK B.1.1.7 samples identified had the E484K change in spike protein that can cause decreased recognition by antibodies.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.\n\n### Funding Statement\n\nThe research was supported by the Houston Methodist Academic Institute Infectious Diseases Fund and many generous Houston philanthropists. James Davis was funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 75N93019C00076.\n\n### Author Declarations\n\nI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.\n\nYes\n\nThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:\n\nThis work was approved by the Houston Methodist Research institutional review board (IRB1010-0199).\n\nAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.\n\nYes\n\nI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).\n\nYes\n\nI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.\n\nYes\n\nGenome data used in this study have been deposited to GISAID."
