    "Description": "For several years I’ve watched the speedrunning community participate in a bi-yearly event called Games Done Quick. This showcase/telethon works to collect as many donations as possible during a week-long videogame speedrunning marathon. One segment that caught my eye was the Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS). These speedruns focus on “scripting” a series of button presses in an emulated environment (an emulator) to beat (and sometimes break) video games. A further extension of this subset of the speedrunning community involves replaying” pre-programmed scripts (thus the “tool” portion) on real hardware. I’ve been putting off reaching out to the community for a few years, but I finally decided to reach out this year. What follows are my observations, learnings, and other notes from working to improve TAS reliability on the N64 console."

You can be making $1,000,000 a year, but if most or all of that income comes from a direct employer and shows up on your W2, your tax bill at the end of the year is effectively a simple formula with very little wiggle room."
