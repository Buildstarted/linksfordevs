This showcase/telethon works to collect as many donations as possible during a week-long videogame speedrunning marathon. One segment that caught my eye was the Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS). These speedruns focus on “scripting” a series of button presses in an emulated environment (an emulator) to beat (and sometimes break) video games. A further extension of this subset of the speedrunning community involves replaying” pre-programmed scripts (thus the “tool” portion) on real hardware. I’ve been putting off reaching out to the community for a few years, but I finally decided to reach out this year. What follows are my observations, learnings, and other notes from working to improve TAS reliability on the N64 console."
