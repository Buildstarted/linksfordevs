For organizations and individuals, the question today is not whether you are or are not using open-source code, but what open-source code you are using, and how much.If you are not aware of what is in your software supply chain, an upstream vulnerability in one of your dependencies can be fatal, making you, and your customers, vulnerable to a potential compromise.Today, we are announcing the public availability of NuGet’s vulnerability features that you can use to ensure your projects are vulnerability free and if not, to take action to securing your software supply chain."
