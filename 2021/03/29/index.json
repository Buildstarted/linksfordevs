    "Description": "I’ve been dealing with QR codes recently, as one of my side projects generates them, and I got curious about how much data you can really fit in a QR code. Specifically, I wondered how much of my favorite book I could fit on one QR code.\nQR Code versions QR Codes have different versions, but they’re not versions as you’d generally think about them, version in this case just means a particular size."

    "Description": "First an apology. I started this project because during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic business was down to a fraction of what it was before then, and I had a lot of time on my hand. But that has changed now and there is a lot of work in my ‘day job’, so I don’t have a whole lot of time to work on the piano software (or to play piano, for that matter). Even so I try to play at least an hour every day, just to unwind from the work, and while doing that I make notes of the things that I think should be improved."
