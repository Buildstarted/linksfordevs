This was a great idea and pioneered the open source ERP environment.\nBut in the last years the name and the vision changed. Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&hellip;\nSo in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs."
