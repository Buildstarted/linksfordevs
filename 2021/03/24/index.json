    "Description": "Somebody is always wrong on the Internet, and bad Docker packaging advice is quite common. But one particular piece of advice keeps coming up, and it’s dangerous enough to merit its own article. In a whole bunch of places you will be told not to install security updates when building your Docker image. This advice is given by the official Docker docs’ best practices page: Avoid RUN apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade, as many of the “essential” packages from the parent images cannot upgrade inside an unprivileged container. To be clear: RUN commands happen during image build, not during container startup. The documentation there is saying “build your images without installing security updates”. You’ll see the same advice in the hadolint Dockerfile linter (it cites the above), and you’ll even see it in the OWASP Docker cheatsheet: Avoid the use of apt/apk upgrade For the vast majority of people creating Dockerfiles this is absolutely awful advice. And since this bad advice is so common, let’s consider some of the justifications and why they are wrong."

Since then, Safari has seen several software updates, and recently I remembered to check again to see whether the issue was resolved. Unfortunately I could still reproduce it, so I decided to investigate further. To my horror, I discovered that Chrome and Firefox were doing it too. That's too much a coincidence to be a bug, right? Could it be that web browsers are keeping open connections after windows are closed on purpose? If you don't have Little Snitch installed on the Mac (you should!), you can still see the open (ESTABLISHED) connections using the lsof (list open files) command-line tool in Terminal:"

So, the reason that this post exists is a bit selfish, but I am hoping it will be helpful to some other folks who are going through the same struggles as I am. In this post, I will go over details of what it takes to work with dependencies in C++ and how the compilation and linking process works."

Now Odoo provides besides the ERP part also a CRM, CMS, Blogs, Forums, E-commerce (Online-Shops), Timesheet, Project Management, Inventory Management, Recruitment, Spreadsheet, Documents, Email Marketing&hellip;\nSo in short: Odoo changed from a focus on ERP to an all-in-one solution which seems to cover nearly every application a business needs."
