    "Description": "This isn‚Äôt meant to be a comprehensive diary of my job-seeking. My personal career journey is not generalizable to everyone‚Äôs situation, and I‚Äôm limiting my sharing to job offers I ultimately received and accepted. First job post-college My first job after college I joined a financial trading firm in Chicago, landing my interview (& ultimately the job offer) from the college career center at Harvey Mudd College. While I‚Äôm grateful for the opportunity I had in that first job to learn about finance and the business world it ultimately was horrible for my mental health & I felt relief quitting that job for a several month period of unemployment. Second job As I was unemployed, I considered going back to school for a graduate degree in computer science (to reorient me to a career in software engineering). After talking with a friend from college who encouraged me to come join the startup he worked at, I re-evaluated the economics of graduate school. Grad school was over $100,000 in opportunity cost (paying for tuition & housing while losing out on salary). Why would I pay to learn software engineering when I could get paid to do it? Despite being cold-shouldered after an initial ‚Äúphone screen‚Äù I made an effort to reduce the friction it might take to interview me by telling the in-house recruiter that I would be passing through town if they wanted to meet: A few hours later I was somewhat surprised to receive a reply: We set up a time to do an on-site interview, and I ultimately got the job (after some awful negotiation on my part). Third Job The 3rd job was a segway from the 2nd‚Äìa transfer from one company to its sister company. The way that went down was very, very weird and I won‚Äôt delve into the details because it‚Äôs not generalizable/a great learning experience. What I will say is that non-compete agreements are really fucked up and I am glad to live in California where these contracts are not upheld in court. Fourth Job I was ready to move home from Massachusetts to California, and reached out to an in-house recruiter at a startup in Berkeley: I would probably write this email differently if I were writing it today, but hey, it worked! I received this reply 4 days later: Fifth Job I stayed at LeadGenius through them raising a Series B round of funding ($14M?), and wanted a change of pace. I‚Äôd literally driven by a company on my way to the gym & looked them up online & on AngelList where they had a job listing with an advertised salary range that was more than I currently earned. So naturally I reached out by cold email + AngelList: Within 8 minutes I received this email reply: Bada bing bada boom‚Äìsome more interviewing later & I had moved on to my fifth job. Sixth Job I moved across the SF bay from Berkeley to San Mateo to move-in with my girlfriend and improve her commute. This led me to job search for a shorter commute and a new work experience‚ÄìI looked around at employers nearby and I realized a personal finance app I used was a 5-minute drive from home. Naturally, I reached out to the head of engineering via cold email (I guessed his email address): Within 3 minutes I received this reply: Seventh Job (Current Role) That brings us to my 7th job, which is my current role. I won‚Äôt dwell on it because I think it‚Äôs the least interesting one. I will say that throughout, reaching out directly to a human being has been the key to my job searches. After all human beings are the ones making the decision to hire you: exchanging their business‚Äôs financial capital for your human capital. If you want any help or have questions about how to do this kind of a job search my inbox is open & I‚Äôll try to help you: max.mautner@gmail.com"

    "Timestamp": "2021-03-05T01:05:11",

    "Description": "I‚Äôve been lucky to IPO with two incredible companies ‚Äì Square, a global payments company in November of 2015 and in May of 2019, Uber. There‚Äôs basically no guidelines for how to manage your IPO as an SEO because it‚Äôs so uncommon. Last year (in the age of tech unicorns) there were but 480 IPOs in all of 2020, the highest ever recorded. That‚Äôs a mere 83 more IPOs than in 2000, which is the 2nd biggest year for IPOs in the last ~2 decades. It‚Äôs probable that some, but not many of those companies even had SEO teams so my guess is there‚Äôs only a handful of us who have ever had to navigate this process. Warning: this isn‚Äôt a very technical article and is almost laughingly simple but a good pulse check for SEOs navigating their first IPO. This also almost certainly will not move SEO or business metrics but is a good opportunity to present yourself as a seasoned thought leader, something I think is serially underinvested in yet a (sadly?) strong contributor to your overall success as a small team in a big company. This article is for you if: your company or client is going to IPO you‚Äôre curious about the funny shenanigans of going public In case you‚Äôre just here for giggles, an IPO (or initial public offering) is when a company goes public on the stock market. This is particularly important and exciting for the company but also a time when there are a lot of nuances in what is/what isn‚Äôt allowed. There are 2 key parts as an SEO I‚Äôve found it necessary to know will come: the investor relations page and almost real-time indexation. Creating the Investor Relations Page The investor relations page is the hub for all investor-related content. At launch it might include things like: the ticker, your current stock price, and any and all IPO-related content either required by the SEC or placed there intentionally to educate both current and future investors. Later on it will be the hub for all earnings recordings to be stored. This page is essentially identical for all companies, here are examples for companies like Facebook and Uber. Meta data and internal linking will be your two key focuses for this page: Meta data ‚Äì Seems silly but remember this will be a highly searched page. It‚Äôs a branded term so this is pretty simple and I would follow a tried and true format. There‚Äôs no bonus points for getting creative here so I would do some version of whatever Facebook, Apple. etc. do. Do not be a hero. Other on-page optimizations are generally not necessary. Internal linking ‚Äì this is not usually an issue because by default companies usually put this in the footer of the site. If that doesn‚Äôt happen though, get major linking signals in because submitting urls for indexing generally does not compensate for having no internal links, even for branded terms (in my experience). While its likely the page would rank without it given the huge influx in links, it‚Äôs still a best practice to internal link. Indexing Investor Content ASAP This is a unique quirk of IPOing you don‚Äôt know to expect until you see it. There‚Äôs a great deal of secrecy around IPOs due to the incredible ramifications of violating SEC guidelines. This means the page can not go live until the IPO event, which means you won‚Äôt have days/weeks to leisurely let googlebot crawl your data. To put yourself and your company in the best case scenario, you want to make sure this page is indexed ASAP once you‚Äôre given the green light and the page is live. It is not a good look to realize all too late that there‚Äôs an unspoken expectation that right at IPO, the page is findable. Your leadership, legal teams and investors will almost certainly do rapid fire searches for this page so here are some tips to ensure a smooth first day on the market. How to get the content indexed asap: Make sure GSC is set up for the property EARLY so you can submit the URL for indexing the second it goes live. Adding slight operational complexity to this investor pages are generally built on subdomains (I believe due to all the bespoke media that has to be housed) so you need to register it separately via your GSC code, html files etc. or have a domain property on the investor subdomain in order to do this Submit the url through GSC ‚Äì self-explanatory but you can learn how to submit urls for indexing here if you haven‚Äôt done it Manage the expectations early ‚Äì delays are understandable if you let your team know its inevitable. Would the page have ranked organically with something like QDF? Maybe it would have but would it take hours? Days? Getting an angry email roughly 3-4 hours after IPO that the page is not showing up in search is not worth losing your internal SEO clout for (been there, done that). Manage expectations early. So that‚Äôs it! I know. Pretty dismal stuff. Really? Write meta data and submit urls for indexing? But it‚Äôs the timing and timelines that I think make this worth calling out. Not managing this upfront is painful. This is not the kind of email thread you want to be your first interaction with your CEO/CFO, trust me. And would the page have been indexable organically? Eventually. But search engines can‚Äôt optimize immediate indexation for events that happen to a paltry 480 websites a year. And while none of this will move SEO metrics, it will hopefully save you one less day of dumpster fire wrangling so you can go and enjoy a well-deserved celebration with your coworkers. PS. Don‚Äôt bother asking to sneak in loaded SEO anchor text links in the initial PR filing ‚Äì it‚Äôs supposedly illegal. Not like we‚Äôd ever ask for such a thing."
