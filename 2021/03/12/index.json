To save costs, you could scale down your user node pools to zero, but your system pool still needs to run. Now, you can stop your entire Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to save costs. When it is stopped, the state of your objects and cluster configuration remains saved, allowing you to restore everything when you start the cluster again."
